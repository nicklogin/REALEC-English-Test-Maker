The graphs illustrate the <<comparison**T1**Noun_number**None**11**comparisons>> of the <<temperatures**T11**Noun_number**None**11**temperature>> in two countries with radically different climate. On these graphs <<there are**T2**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**are>> #DELETE#5#fixed maximal and minimal <<temperatures**T13**Noun_number**None**11**temperature>> <<throughout**T14**Prepositions**None**6**during>> the year. Generally speaking, indicators of maximum and minimum <<are situated**T15**Voice**None**7**situate>> <<close**T16**lex_part_choice**None**7**closely>> to each other, it means that over the period of one month temperature <<remains**T3**Agreement_errors**None**6**remain>> almost <<constant**T17**lex_item_choice**None**6**steady>>. As for <<the weather**T18**Articles**None**7**weather>> in Yakutsk, it always changes. The <<hottest**T4**Spelling**None**6**hotest>> time in the year is July, but the coldest period is December and January. <<Data**T5**Countable_uncountable**None**5**Datas>> of Rio de Janeiro look <<different**T6**lex_part_choice**None**11**differently>>. <<The temperature**T19**Articles**None**11**Temperature>> in Brazil <<remains**T7**Agreement_errors**None**6**remain>> stable with some fluctuations#DELETE#1#, <<throughout**T20**Prepositions**None**6**within>> whole year. More detailed view reveals that <<the peak**T10**Spelling**None**4**pick>> of temperature in Russia is about 25*C, whereas in Rio the highest point is near to 30*C. However, <<the difference**T8**Articles**None**10**difference>> between minimal indicators in <<these**T9**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> countries <<is much greater**T24**Absence_explanation**None**12**much greater>>. In Yakutsk <<the temperature**T26**Articles**None**11**temperature>> <<decreases**T10**Agreement_errors**None**8**decrease>> to approximately â€“ 40*C, but in Rio de Janeiro it is never less than 17*C.
