In <<the century**T310**Articles**None**7**century>> of modern technologies, which can help people in different spheres of life, there are a lot of problems caused by modern samples of technique. 
To begin with, new technologies are created for making life easier, so people do less activities and the consequence is problem with weight (overweight). Because people, using Internet, can get goods and products with delivery, sitting at home. Also there are some types of robots which can do some basic tasks for you: cooking meal, cleaning the house and so on. To solve this problem, people should be more active, doing certain physical exercises and going for regular waks. People should understand that modern <<gadgets**T305**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>> make you lazy and you should not use only your <<gadgets**T306**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>>, you can do some tasks yourself.
Another health problem is problem with eyes. Children from the early childhood use different <<gadgets**T307**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>>, such as: Iphones, Ipads, laptops and others. They are watching cartoons, videos on Youtube channel, playing online games during all the day and this can cause problems with eyes. To solve this problem, parents should limit time <<spent**T308**Voice**None**8**spending>> using the gadjets and <<spend**T309**Redundant_comp**None**20**parents should spend>> more time with their children: tell them fairy tales, go for a walk, do educational activities. For children it is better to go to sport and educational sections.
Nowadays there are a lot of different technologies that can help you in life and difficult situations, but people should make a limit for using <<gadgets**T310**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>>, because they have both positive and negative effects. Negative effects should be reduced as they are dangerous for peopleâ€™s health.
