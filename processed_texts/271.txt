<<Nowadays**T1**Spelling**None**7**Nowdays>> with the help of the Internet people can easily find any music and films they want. But also they can find pirate copies and <<get it**T2**Transitive**None**3**get>> for free. Some people think that this is <<a crime**T3**Articles**None**5**crime>> and pirates have to be punished. Others <<tell**T4**Agreement_errors**None**5**tells>> that art <<has**T5**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> to be free.
In my opinion, pirates <<move**T6**Agreement_errors**None**5**moves>> all industry of music and cinema forward. <<For example,**T7**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> the huge part of teenagers <<has**T8**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> no money to buy hundreds of songs and albums. But <<when they have a chance to get it for free,**T10**Punctuation**None**42**when they have a chance to get it for free>> they find their favourite bands, songs and give <<a chance**T11**Articles**None**6**chance>> for unknown <<musicians**T12**Spelling**None**10**musiciants>> become famous. <<There are thousands of examples of bands who give their music for free, they see it as a way to introduce their art to a huge auditory.**T16**Punctuation**None**134**There are thousands of examples of bands who give their music for free, they see it as a way to introduce their art to a huge auditory>> Anyway the main part of <<musician's**T19**Possessive**None**8**musician>> money is money from tickets, that means if more people <<hear**T20**Tense_choice**None**9**will hear>> you, more people will come to the show and band will get more money.
Thatâ€™s how pirates help <<the bands**T21**Articles**None**5**bands>> and <<the whole industry**T22**Articles**None**14**whole industry>>. The only chance for groups to make a lot of money is to make good music and great shows. Also I like the <<idea**T23**Capitalisation**None**4**Idea>> how Apple <<solves**T27**Agreement_errors**None**5**solve>> problems with pirates, they make all music on Apple music free, but enter for month costs some money, this is one more way to overcome <<the problem**T24**Articles**None**7**problem>>.
<<In the end,**T25**Punctuation**None**10**In the end>> I would like to say that there are a lot of ways <<to win**T26**Infinitive_constr**None**3**win>> over the pirates and punishing is not one of them.
