It has become a matter of a huge concern that young people commit more crimes than earlier. That is why it is very important to understand the causes of this trend in order to solve this issue.
First of all, it is obvious that millennials at their current age have more opportunities and higher living standards than their parents or grandparents had. Young people often do not need to be concerned about how to help their family and so on. This results in a larger amount of free time, which, unfortunately, is not fully occupied by useful things such as sports or studying. In other words, young people have enough time to do whatever they want, which sometimes includes getting into “wrong” companies of friends<< who can rob or attack innocent people just for the sake of fun**T1**Defining**None**64**, who can rob or attack innocent people just for the sake of fun>>. That is one of the mechanisms how young people can start to commit crimes.
Another reason of the described trend of more crimes committed by the young age group people might be as follows: <<contemporary**T2**lex_item_choice**None**7**current>> media <<produces**T3**Agreement_errors**None**7**produce>> a lot of content which <<features**T6**lex_item_choice**None**17**is connected with>> cruelty, and young adults become more tolerant to crimes by <<watching**T5**Spelling**None**7**wathing>> such content. For instance, news agencies often try to show some awful and scaring videos from the places of accidents such as <<airplane crashes**T4**Absence_comp_colloc**None**16**airplane crushes>>, car accidents or terrorist attacks. Such videos spread extremely quickly in social networks, which are very popular among youngsters. As a result, especially this age group faces a lot of cruelty online through these videos.
In order to tackle the above-mentioned causes of the problem, I would, firstly, suggest creating multiple hobby clubs at schools, so that pupils could have a variety of things to do in their free time. Evidently, this measure would be even more effective, if school students had an obligation to attend at least several hobby clubs. As for the cruel content on TV and on the Internet, it can be wise to put more age restrictions on it. However, it is necessary to keep in mind the possibility of an opposite effect which <<is**T7**Spelling**None**2**in>> that young people might get angry, if they are prohibited to watch something. I believe that such effect can be avoided, if both mentioned measures are implemented, because then young people will not have time to try to watch <<prohibited**T8**Spelling**None**11**prohibitted>> content. Also, parents should pay attention to what their children are occupied with.
To sum up, it is necessary to emphasize that the problem can be effectively addressed only if a combination of techniques is used. In this case both teachers at schools and parents at home should be attentive to #DELETE#3#the children and surround them with support. It would be the best way to destroy any incentives to commit crimes.
