Nowadays, <<sport**T6**Articles**None**9**the sport>> is considered to be an integral part of our life. Even watching <<tv**T2**Spelling**None**2**Tv>> and live sports events can be beneficial. Numerous people strongly support this idea when <<some others**T8**Ref_device**None**12**some of them>> are against it and regard this activity as useless #DELETE#3#one. <<Personally,**T11**Linking_device**None**13**What about me>>, I support the first point of view.

Generally, some people are convinced that watching TV programs is a waste of time indeed. Sports events are not an exception. During this period of time, a person can do something more useful and practical: cleaning the house or walking a dog. Moreover, they are sure that it can be bad for health. To illustrate, during a penalty or when a player is suspended or even dropped, the tension rises. As a result, a person watching it starts gesticulating more actively and shouting to express hi<<his or her**T12**Ref_device**None**3**his>>motions. As a consequence, he<<he**T13**Ref_device**None**2**he>>ecomes vulnerable to various heart problems, such as heart attacks. Respectively, it may have grave af<<consequences**T14**lex_item_choice**None**10**aftermaths>>But at the same time, it is a wonderful oppurtunity to express all the emotions, both positive and negative ones. Ne<<Nevertheless**T15**Punctuation**None**11**Nevetheless>>the disadvantages are plentiful.

But it is only one side of the coin. Due to sports events, people participate in them to c<<to a certain extent**T16**Articles**None**17**to certain extent>>ey are involved in the process of the game and pay no attention to day-to-day problems.

Addu<<Additionally**T5**Spelling**None**12**Addutionally>> may be so exciting that finally pers<<a person**T18**Articles**None**6**person>>ts to become a player of the team and take part in this sport. Definitely, it is a step of great significance that<<, which**T19**Linking_device**None**4**that>> a positive impact on a health. Although, it is important to remember that the risk of traumas and injuries is a<<also exists**T3**Agreement_errors**None**13**is also exist>>ne<<One should not**T20**Negation**None**11**None should>>lect his <<his or her**T22**Ref_device**None**3**his>>lth as it is the most precious thing that we have. The last but not the least is the argument that sport events may play an education role.

In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that effect of watching sports events is a debatable issue. But I am sure that perks outweigh drawbacks if person<<a person**T29**Articles**None**6**person>>it carefully and not be<<does not become**T30**Absence_comp_colloc**None**10**not become>>kless fan.
