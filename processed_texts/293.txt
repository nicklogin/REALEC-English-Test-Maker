Nowadays people do not buy music or films <<on**T1**Prepositions**None**2**in>> legal sites or usual shops because there are many other ways to obtain it. That is why it makes their <<lives**T2**Spelling**None**5**lifes>> easier with saving money. Some people can say that it is illegal and everyone should be punished for pirate copies.
First of all, nobody can doubt that music and films are essential products and we cannot live without it. Unfortunately, people do not appreciate such hard work of musicians and film producers <<, who try to create something new and particular**T3**Non_defining**None**46**who try to create something new and particular>>. Besides, they want a feedback that can be counted. Of course, they do it for inspiration but they want a material profit. Moreover, <<they will create more and more with money**T4**Standard**None**41**with money they will create more and more>>. That is why illegal pirate copies should not be allowed because they demolish all creatorsâ€™ profits.
Nevertheless, we continue to download music and films from secret platforms, which are illegal. Undoubtedly, not everyone can afford to buy original discs. It all has a <<prize**T9**lex_item_choice**None**4**cost>> <<, and**T7**Punctuation**None**3**and>> many people cannot spend their money for it. So, it is useful to upload such <<pleasant**T8**Spelling**None**8**pleasunt>> products of art for free.
As for me, I download music and films only on the Internet. I understand that it is unfair but I do not want to pay for it. However, it is easy and fast to copy files in that way. So, I support this illegal type of uploading.
Overall, everyone has own opinion about ways of getting music and films. Some people agree with illegal pirate copies <<, and**T9**Punctuation**None**3**and>> other claim it to be punished.
