Some people claim that the art, including music and films, is supposed to be free to share. However, there are opponents of this point of view who believe that people that share music and films should be prisoned. I support the latter opinion.
First of all, there is a data that shows that producers, who make our favourite music and films, borrow huge costs from production of these pieces of art. To make them continue writing songs and <<shooting**T1**lex_item_choice**None**9**recording>> films, consumers should give their money and <<make**T2**Spelling**None**4**more>> the distribution process absolutely clear. Some <<big**T3**Spelling**None**3**bid>> companies like Apple or Google have already invented a service which makes the process easier â€“ people pay a monthly fee and listen to as much music and watch as many films as they want.
Secondly, the developed countries have implemented a lot of copyrights laws that save musicians and film producers from losing money and punish those people who break the laws. For example, the founder of <<the Piratebay**T4**Articles**None**9**Piratebay>>, a website with tons of illegal music, films and books, was sentenced to 21 years in American prison! These lawsuits, for sure, will prevent people from sharing the pieces of art illegally. 
In conclusion, it must be noted that illegal copying and sharing music or films is one of the main problems in the modern digital world and no doubt it should be discussed by politicians on the highest level. As discs with music and films die in the past and media go the Internet, the government should issue strong restrictions on distribution of illegal digital content.
