There is at present a crucial tendency of a constantly increasing level of crime observed amoung <<youngster**T1**Spelling**None**10**youngsetrs>>. In fact, modern children and teenagers have got freedom of actions not realising, though, a higher responsibility they are to bear now in comparison with the same age group of the past. Indeed, it is vital for their mentors, first of all, to take urgent measures in order to seize the control of youths' behaviour. In this essay I will analyse the main reasons for such a trend proposing a number of possible ways as how to change it.

The first factor that ha<<has**T2**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> negative impact on children's mind is the media. Actually, the abundance of TV programs, newspaper articles and other sources demonstrate real murders, terroristic attacks, just horror films that people get used to very quickly despite the age. For this reason, parents and teachers should track what their children watch and read at school as well as during their leisure controlling state of their mind.
Another cause of the agg<<aggressive**T3**Spelling**None**9**aggressif>>haviour is simply the lack of attention. Unfortunately, nowadays parents are often too busy working their way up the career ladder so that young people have to spend most of the time only on their own. That is why, it is essential, as much as possible, to discuss with children their problems, friends, plans for fut<<the future**T5**Articles**None**6**future>>he same is true for teachers, they could organise some meetings of psychological grounds, for instance, in order to get close to students and provide them with an opportunity to voice their worries and ideas.

Finally, young people often follow a slippery slope becoming criminals because they have nobody to look up to. It is necessary for a growing individual to take an invaluable life experience after their mentors. To put it another way, parents as well as teachers should share their skills with children setting a positive example to them. Also they can help them to find a prominent social figure to follow who would inspire children throughout the whole life.

Taking everything into account, modern young people are heavily influenced by the community they are exposed to. In order to draw a line under the number of crimes commite<<committed**T4**Spelling**None**8**commited>>ths, it would be really feasible, in any case, for parents and teachers to bring harmony to their relationship paying a significant attention to their wishes and needs.
