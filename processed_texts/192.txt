The bar chart illustrates how the <<number**T1**lex_item_choice**None**4**rate>> of unemployed people changed between 2014 and 2015 in a sample of the largest world regions.
It can be clearly seen from <<the graph**T2**Articles**None**7**a graph>> that the highest level of unemployment is in North Africa and equals 12,5 per cent, which is twice higher than the average world rate of unemployment. <<On the other hand, the lowest level of unemployment**T3**Redundant_comp**None**104**On the other hand, the lowest level of unemployment. On the other hand, the lowest level of unemployment>> can be seen in Asia, with an absolute <<magnitude**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**meaning>> of 3,9 per cent. The rates in those two regions <<did not change**T5**Tense_choice**None**16**have not changed>> in a period between 2014 and 2015, however we can see a diminishing tendency in the other world regions.
For example, the rate of unemployed people went down in both Latin America and Middle East mainly because the living standards of these regions <<have increased**T6**Tense_choice**None**14**were increased>> over the past years.
<<The**T7**Redundant_comp**None**25**The only region where the>> unemployment rate in most regions <<steadily fell**T8**Tense_choice**None**19**has steadily fallen>> over the observed period. However, some regions <<such as**T9**lex_part_choice**None**2**as>> North Africa and Middle East still have extremely high levels of unemployment, thus if these regions will have any improvements in the next few years, the world unemployment problem may be solved.
