The chart shows changes in the unemployment rate in selected world regions in 2014 and 2015.
The first region described on the graph is Northern Africa. The rate of unemployment there <<was**T1**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> <<stable**T2**lex_item_choice**None**5**state>>: it <<did not change**T3**Tense_choice**None**15**has not changed>> from 2014 to 2015. The next column shows us <<changes**T23**Spelling**None**6**chages>> in the <<Middle**T4**Spelling**None**5**Midde>> East. Here we can see a decrease of unemployment level. Most countries of <<these**T5**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> regions may be called “developing”. So while living conditions <<became**T8**Tense_choice**None**6**become>> better, <<the unemployment rate was falling slowly**T6**Standard**None**40**the unemployment rate was falling slowly>>. <<The third graph**T9**Articles**None**11**Third graph>> shows us the situation in Europe. The number of <<unemployed**T10**Category_confusion**None**12**unemployment>> people <<had risen**T11**Tense_choice**None**9**has risen>> there. I think it was caused by a huge migration crisis in the Europe region. While in <<the EU**T12**Articles**None**2**EU>> the unemployment rate <<was rising**T13**Tense_choice**None**9**is rising>>, in Latin America it <<fell**T15**Tense_choice**None**5**falls>> from 6,8 to 5,8 percent. It <<was**T16**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> the second huge fall after the Middle East. In <<South Asia**T17**Articles**None**14**the South Asia>> the <<percentage**T24**Often_confused**None**7**percent>> of <<unemloyed**T18**Category_confusion**None**12**unemployment>> people <<wasn't changed**T19**Tense_choice**None**20**has not been changed>> from 2014 to 2015.
Total worldwide level of unemployment <<was**T20**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> 5,9%. I consider it was caused by the big differences between <<these**T22**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**4**this>> <<rates**T21**Noun_number**Dependent_change**4**rate>> in selected world regions and regions not described on the chart.
