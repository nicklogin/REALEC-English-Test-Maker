The use of <<doping**T4**Derivation**None**7**dopping>> in professional sport is <<one**T5**Word_choice**None**10**staying on>> of the vital problems nowadys. This issue is strongly <<debated**T3**Articles**None**8**a debats>> in society. One part of society suppose that sportsmen, who used illegal <<drugs**T8**Spelling**None**5**grugs>>, must be banned from competitions only for a limited period, while the another part of society think that professional sportmen <<should be banned**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**be banned>> for the <<rest**T10**Word_choice**None**3**end>> of their lives.
People, who <<have**T11**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> first opinion, think that all people can <<make**T12**Word_choice**None**4**have>> a <<mistake**T13**Noun_number**None**8**mistakes>>, and the society <<should**T14**Modals**None**5**shall>> give professional athletes <<a chance**T15**Articles**None**6**chance>> to improve situation. Moreover, in some of <<situations**T36**Noun_number**None**9**situation>> surounding people are <<blamed for**T37**Prepositions**None**9**blamed in>> using drugs by sportsmen because they <<wait for results**T38**Prepositions**None**12**wait results>> and it is <<stressful**T39**Category_confusion**None**6**stress>> for sportsmen.
Another part of society <<suppose**T40**Spelling**None**8**suppouse>> that <<using illegal drugs**T41**Prepositions**None**22**using of illegal drugs>> <<is**T42**Spelling**None**2**in>> <<a serious and unexpected**T43**Articles**None**20**serious and unexused>> mistake for professional sportsmen.
Such behavior of athletes is <<a bad example**T17**Articles**None**11**bad example>> for others, <<especially**T18**Spelling**None**11**espessially>> for <<children**T19**Articles**None**10**a children>>, who like <<watching**T3**Gerund_phrase**None**3**see>> sport <<programs**T3**Spelling**None**8**programm>> on TV and do professional <<sports**T24**Noun_number**None**5**sport>>. Also, <<they state that**T25**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**they that>> <<a competition**T32**Articles**None**11**competition>> must be honest and all sportsmen should <<respect**T26**Word_choice**None**4**know>> rules and achieve their results and <<goals**T3**Word_choice**None**3**aim>> in <<an honest competition**T29**Articles**None**16**honest competion>>, so using illegal drugs, in opinion of <<those**T30**Pronouns**None**4**that>> people, is <<a grave mistake**T3**Word_choice**None**20**very serious mistake>> and it is essential for society to <<ban**T31**Spelling**None**4**bann>> such athletes for the rest of their lives.
Taking <<different opinions**T35**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**different>> mentioned above into consideration, I strongly believe, that all people have a right to <<make a mistake**T2**lex_part_choice**None**7**mistake>> and professional <<disqualification**T3**Spelling**None**16**discvalification>> for athletes should be limited.
