The charts below demonstrate the amount of various <<types**T1**Spelling**None**5**tipes>> of goods transported by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. Information is given in percentage of the total amount of transported goods.
It can be deduced o<<from**T3**Prepositions**None**2**of>>the first diagram that the biggest part of all railway transportation makes metal - it is 35 percent of total amount. The second p<<popular one**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**popular>>a<<is**T5**Tense_form**None**3**are>>manufactured goods.

It can also be noticed that the pa<<shares**T16**lex_item_choice**None**5**parts>>f Ch<<chemicals**T8**Capitalisation**None**9**Chemicals>>food products and Ma<<machinery**T9**Capitalisation**None**9**Machinery>>ransported are almost equal - 11 percent for the first and se<<for the second**T27**Prepositions**None**6**second>>nd 12 percent for the third.

To sum up, if the most transported by rail tipe<<type**T23**Spelling**None**4**tipe>>good<<goods**T24**Countable_uncountable**None**4**good>>metal, for the road transportation it is food products. the amount of food transported by rail make<<accounts for**T25**lex_item_choice**None**5**makes>>percent of tota<<the total amount**T26**Articles**None**12**total amount>>ich is thre<<three times lower**T28**Comparative_constr**None**19**three times decrise>>comparison to t<<with**T30**Prepositions**None**2**to>> second chart.
