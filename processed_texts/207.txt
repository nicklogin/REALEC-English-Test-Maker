Nowadays, many people buy or download illegal discs, instead of buying the original discs in the shop. Some people belive that buying illegal discs should <<be**T1**Spelling**None**2**by>> punished.
<<In my opinion,**T2**Punctuation**None**13**In my opinion>> the <<government**T3**Spelling**None**9**goverment>> <<does**T285**Agreement_errors**None**2**do>> not have to punish people who buy such products, but people who produce illegal pirate copies should be punished. Nowadays, the biggest part of people buy or download films <<or**T287**Spelling**None**2**of>> music <<on**T4**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the Internet**T26**Articles**None**8**internet>> <<on**T7**Prepositions**None**2**in>> such web-sites like <<Amazon**T8**Capitalisation**None**6**amazon>> or <<eBay**T9**Spelling**None**4**ebay>>. <<Of course,**T10**Punctuation**None**9**Of course>> <<on**T11**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the <<Internet**T12**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> you <<cannot**T284**Spelling**None**7**can not>> understand <<whether it is an original disc or not**T289**Absence_comp_sent**None**35**is it an original disc or it is not>>. Moreover, sellers do not want to tell real information about their production <<, especially**T13**Punctuation**None**10**especially>> about quality and manufacturer. Futhermore, that means that many buyers even do not know that they buy illegal products.
<<On**T14**Prepositions**None**2**In>> <<the other hand**T15**Articles**None**10**other hand>>, there are people who get <<a huge amount**T16**Articles**None**11**huge amount>> of money every month from producing illegal copies of <<famous musical group's albums**T293**Absence_explanation**None**21**famous musical groups>>. Such people make <<an illegal version**T17**Articles**None**15**illegal version>> of <<the original discs**T295**Articles**None**14**original discs>> and sell it <<on**T18**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the Internet**T26**Articles**None**8**internet>> or in some small shops. They get a huge amount of money doing this illegal work and <<, in my opinion,**T21**Punctuation**None**13**in my opinion>> they should be punished.
In conclusion, musical and film producers lose their money <<because of**T22**Prepositions**None**4**from>> illegal pirate copies. People who <<buy**T23**Spelling**None**2**by>> such illegal products sometimes even do not know that <<they are**T297**Agreement_errors**None**5**it is>> not original, and they pay money and get a bad product <<of**T301**Prepositions**None**4**with>> <<awful quality**T299**Articles**None**16**an awful quality>>. So #DELETE#11#in addition people who produce pirate copies should be punished.
