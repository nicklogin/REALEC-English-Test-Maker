It is claimed that piracy is a real theft and people should be punished for it. Surely, musicians and producers suffer from the internet piracy, but I also believe that the internet is a zone of free exchange.

On the one hand, it is an obvious fact that even music of films in the internet have their creators. Everybody can say about their authority and prove it juridically. For example, each legally working internet source would delete your music or other product of your intellectual work if you ask for it. Furthermore, each cultural object and each worker of this area deserve respectance. It is normal for people to get money for their job. And if the only way to sell the project is downloading it to in the internet source, people should understand that sharing it in the illegal way is wrong and unfair.

On the other hand, the internet i famous for its freedom. Nobody can be arrested while doing something anonymously. That is why the piracy can be understood. Moreover, it can be mentioned that internet music and films are not material objects and sometimes people just can not believe that they should pay for something they could not touch.

To sum up, internet piracy is disrespective illegal action, but the main advantage of internet is that it is a zone of free exchange, so producers and authors should learn to work with this knowledge.
