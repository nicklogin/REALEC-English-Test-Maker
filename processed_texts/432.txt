It is popularly believed that today's world is more amd more suffering from criminality and above all from those which are committed by teenagers. In this essay I am going to dwell on this problem and come up with possible solutions to it.

Firstly, young people's behavior strongly depends on their childhood, parents and nurture. It is true that most crimes are committed by teenager who were brought up in bad families and had a very painful childhood. To prevent children from growing up in such circumstances a social program should be envented. The one where a lot of people are eager to help with all they have, who could go to these children's houses and have a long talk with their relatives about parenting and a possibility of giving up a child and send him or her to another family or special house if the parents were proven unworthy.

Another significant cause of such behavior is considered to be peer pressure. Some teenages tend to be depended on other people's opinion and oftenly these people are their classmates or freinds. Even if a child was brought up in a healthy pleasant family his peers could have a great influence on his pr hers perception. To tackle this problem teacher should have special meetings with their students where they could easily explain the kids the rules of the world they are living in and the way they have to bahave if they want to live in peace.

To conclude, bringing up a child is a very seriuos task and people should do it with great responsibility to prevent teenages from committing any crimes and becoming outlaws.
