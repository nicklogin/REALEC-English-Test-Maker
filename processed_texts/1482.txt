<<It**T1**Ref_device**None**5**There>> is <<one**T2**Articles**None**7**the one>> of the most important <<problems**T3**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> in the modern media world that musicans and film producers lose <<an enormous amount**T4**Articles**None**15**enormous amount>> of money because of illegal pirate copies. Some people think that copying and sharing music and films on the <<Internet**T5**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> is theft and people who download these files and <<do not**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> buy <<original discs**T7**Articles**None**18**the original discs>> should be punished <<, but**T57**Punctuation**None**2**bu>> <<others**T10**Noun_number**None**9**the other>> think that there is nothing criminal to share <<such**T11**lex_item_choice**None**4**that>> content by <<this**T12**Ref_device**None**4**that>> way. 

<<recently**T13**Punctuation**None**9**Recently,>> more and more music and film companies close the free access to their product. More and more tracking <<programs**T14**Noun_number**None**7**program>> like ‘torrent’ become illegal and <<banned**T15**lex_item_choice**None**6**closed>>. It happens because people who make music or films <<do not want to lose**T17**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**16**do not want lose>> their money. The main reason is that they #DELETE#2#be might <<not**T19**Spelling**None**2**no>> have enough money to make a new product if they <<did not**T20**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn’t>> get enough from the recent. If you really want to see the new film <<made**T21**Spelling**None**5**maded>> by your <<favorite**T22**lex_item_choice**None**4**best>> film producer or <<listen to**T23**lex_item_choice**None**4**hear>> <<new music**T24**Articles**None**13**the new music>> <<made**T25**Spelling**None**5**maded>> by your <<favorite**T26**lex_item_choice**None**4**best>> <<singer**T27**lex_item_choice**None**6**artist>> or group, you should buy the original discs to give them a money for <<future**T28**lex_item_choice**None**3**new>> works. Nowadays #DELETE#2#is a lot of web resources <<give**T30**lex_item_choice**None**8**provides>> <<an opportunity**T31**Articles**None**15**the opportunity>> to buy legal music or <<films**T32**Noun_number**None**4**film>> like ‘Itunes.com’. It is <<an easy an convinient way**T33**Articles**None**23**easy and convinient way>> to get what you want with good quality and <<it is not really expensive**T34**Absence_explanation**None**20**not really expensive>>. 

However, <<other**T35**Often_confused**None**7**another>> people <<do not**T36**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> want to pay for <<the content**T37**Articles**None**7**content>> they like. They think that all of <<these**T38**Ref_device**None**4**this>> products must be <<free to all people**T39**Prepositions**None**19**free for all people>>. They use some illegal programms to download and share music and <<films**T40**Noun_number**None**4**film>>. #DELETE#8#Unlikely the usually <<do not care**T43**Inappropriate_register**None**18**do not give a damn>> that this way may destroy <<the media system**T44**Articles**None**12**media system>>. Without enough amount of money companies <<cannot**T45**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>>  make good quality <<products**T46**Noun_number**None**7**product>> and sometimes <<their**T47**Pronouns**None**4**they>> works become worse and not interesting <<anymore**T48**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**more>>.

In conclusion, <<film and music companies**T49**Articles**None**28**the film and music companies>> depend on <<the money**T52**Articles**None**5**money>> that <<they get**T51**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**get>> <<for their products**T53**Prepositions**None**19**from their products>>. People must give them <<an opportunity**T54**lex_item_choice**None**6**chance>> to make a new interesting and good quality product. The illegal programs and sites must be blocked and closed and people who download <<these**T55**Spelling**None**4**thes>> files<< instead of**T56**Punctuation**None**12**, instead of>> buying the original disc or <<copy**T57**Noun_number**None**6**copies>>, should be punished. Let’s make this world better.
