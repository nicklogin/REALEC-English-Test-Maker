There is no doubt, that people who work in art industry lose lots of there money because they have not enough protection. For my opinion, it is bad to copy, but on the other side I know that we can not live another way. So, I really want to explain why we should try to protect art industry.

Firstly, I want to say that it is illegal to copy and share files which are not original. And we have certain anount of low which says that we will be punished. There are lows about originality, they protect authour from illigal copyind. For example, I remember that when I made my own movie for university someone copyed it and shared with others. Of course, I was in shock and feel uncomfortable. So, we can only imagine how it stresful and how mach money lose some producers because other people share their masterpiece with others and donot even pay them. I do believe that our low should punish that people. We have a lot of opportunities to find people who does smth illigal, it is not so unimaginable. And that is my other suggestion to the Government. We should follow people who put that on Internet and do not pay money for that or do not have a permition to do it.

On the other side, It seems quite unreal because it is an easy navy and we can downland it free. Not everyone have enough money to pay for everything they want.

But I do not know people who really wanted something and did not get it. My uncle, for enstance, tried as hard as could be to get new painting. So same, should do we.

I personally prefer pay for everything that made with love , and whem smb spend time on it. Musicians spend a lot of days doing their own songs.

All in all, there are different lows which are protect all kind of work. If we were not pay for any of them we are ruin there lives because they do not have enough money to do something pleasure. So people who wonâ€™t pay should be punished.
