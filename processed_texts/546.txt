British and American movies are extremely popular all over the world. This situation may cause worries among local film productions, as movies they make often don't get a lot of popularity. Some people believe that governments should financially support local movie industries. I totally agree with this point of view.

First of all, people's choice is ca<<influenced**T1**lex_item_choice**None**6**caused>>y a lot of different factors, if some movie is getting more popular than others, it probably means that it has better video and audio effects, visual picture is more entertaining or the plot better catches attention of the person watching the movie. However,there are a lot of movies which made huge sums of money just by using better commercial methods. Such films become popular before they are even available to watch. People wait for them and go to see them, even though they don't always get positive reviews. At the same time a local film can be totally ignored by people just because pr<<the producers**T2**Articles**None**9**producers>>on't have enough money to advertise it. Financial support from the government can help solve this problem and give a chance to really good films made by small movie companies.

Moreover, it is important to support and develop culture of each country. At the age of the Internet things become easier to find, it means both that people from other countries can see movies from America and England, and that people from the US or UK can, for instance, watch shows from India or any other country, but the problem is that English is spoken in a lot of places and it is not that difficult to understand the story of the film, while language barrier makes it hard to watch local movies from other countries. Translating them into English or at least providing English subtitles can significantly help, but it once again comes to money. The budget of local movies is really small and they can't afford to spend more on the translation of the movie. Governments could have offered free traslation of the movies to best local film industries, so the movies they make could become famous in other parts of the world.

To sum up, I believe that there are two main reasons for British and American movies being so popular all over the world. A lot of people can speak English, but not many can understand languages from other world regions, which makes it is easier for movies from the US or UK to spread. Also local industries don't have a lot of money to advertise their movies. Government can help solve both of these problems.
