It is said, that music and film piracy can strongly damage musicians and film producers. In case of that people, who download pirate content instead of buying original, must be punished.

Unfortunatelly, internet piracy has no respect musicians or film producers. This is very sad, because talented musicians and producers spend their time, patience for making good films and music for people, and it’s normal, that they must have a money reward for their work from sells. Pirates just steal their money in an illegal way. So it is right, that people, who support piracy and download pirate copies must be punished, because they steal content and disrespect tha author.

Actually, in some cases piracy is not as bad as we think about it. Imagine, that you want to read a book, but you can’t buy it in region, where you live. You want to buy it on the internet, but they don’t ship to your country. In that case, you download this book from torrent illegaly. Yes, it is bad, but it is the only way for you to get what you want.

As a musician, I can say, that I respect many musicians, but I rarely buy their content. Why? Because I don’t have enough money to afford every disk I want. Nowadays music CDs are growing in price and you can buy them only if you’re a big fan of a curuent album or band. But you want to listen more music from this musician, and here comes piracy.

So I think, that the best way is to buy original content of different authors that you like the most, but to download illegaly that content, that you can’t get in your country or you just can’t afford.
