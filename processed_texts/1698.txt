The problem of using illegal drugs is increasingly sufficient for modern-day sport. The decision <<should**T6**Modals**None**9**is should>> be made: to ban <<athletes**T7**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> <<caught**T22**Tense_form**None**6**cought>> using them for a limited time or to definitely exclude them from competitions. This essay will discuss both points of view and find out the most suitable.
To start with, banning <<athletes**T8**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> for a <<certain**T9**Word_choice**None**8**confined>> period is obviously more humane. A person caught using prohibited drugs may understand it was <<awful**T10**Suffix**None**6**awfull>> and <<regret it**T20**Word_choice**None**14**make a remorse>>. <<Despite the fact that**T15**Prepositions**None**7**Despite>> some <<athletes**T11**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> use them, they apparently need to be tought that it is a serious crime in sports. Sport doctors and other medicine personnel of teams should be blamed for allowing and even not knowing about <<athletes**T23**Possessive**None**8**athlet's>> illegal drugs using, of course.
However, there are people that think that sports societies should <<prohibit these athletes from competing**T19**Transitive**None**23**prohibit these athletes>> for the rest of their lives. This point of view is very strict, <<although**T3**Spelling**None**7**althoug>> the most evident solution to <<the illegal drugs problem**T26**Articles**None**21**illegal drugs problem>> is a total ban of persons of such a reprehensible conduct. It may be argued that one who was once caught should be frightened of being caught again - this will predestine that culprit will never attempt to cheat <<anymore**T25**Adverbs**None**9**once more>>. Evidently, the latter statement is fallacious: the one who used a drug in his or her past is likely to do it one more time. The sound argument for banning culpable <<athletes**T21**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> forever is that sport society needs to be cleaned from those who do not attain sport's moral code. This strict <<decision**T12**Spelling**None**8**desicion>> will obviously maintain guaranted level of honest competition.
To conclude, two points of view have been discussed: one was to ban <<athletes**T1**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> <<who have been using**T23**Tense_choice**None**5**using>> prohibited drugs for a period of time and <<the other**T5**Articles**None**5**other>> - to <<disqualify**T4**Word_choice**None**14**disqualificate>> them for the rest of their career. My opinion is that the latter is, despite being significantly rigid, the best solution to the issue of illegal drugs <<use**T24**Category_confusion**None**5**using>>. <<That is**T23**Inappropriate_register**None**6**That's>> why I totally agree with it.
