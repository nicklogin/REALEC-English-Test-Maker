It is thought<< that**T1**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<the widespread use**T2**Absence_explanation**None**10**widespread>> of modern technologies causes <<the appearance**T3**Articles**None**10**appearance>> of new diseases. I totally agree with this statement and I will try to prove it in my essay. 

Several health problems are caused by <<the widespread use**T4**Absence_explanation**None**10**widespread>> of modern technology. First of all, it could be some kinds of addictions. For example, computer addiction. <<The information**T5**Articles**None**11**Information>> in the Internet is such interesting and attractive that people cannot log out and return to <<real life**T6**Articles**None**13**the real life>>. Secondly, spending a lot of time in front of computer is followed by problems with eyes. People have to wear glasses to see everything well. Sitting in front of <<a computer**T7**Articles**None**8**computer>> may also cause <<an overweight**T8**Articles**None**10**overweight>><< if**T9**Punctuation**None**4**, if>> you <<do not move**T10**Tense_choice**None**14**are not moving>> <<at all**T11**lex_item_choice**None**8**anywhere>>. Finally, the content of several web pages could cause psychological problems or ever force people to commit a suicide. 

In my opinion, the number of steps can be made to reduce the negative impact on peopleâ€™s health. To start with, free call centers should be created to help computer <<addictors**T12**Category_confusion**None**9**adductors>>. The next step could be improving technology to make them less harmful to health. Finally, <<people should**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**should>> take care about the other kinds of facilities<< that**T14**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> could attract people more than computers and mobile phones in their spare time. For example, <<new cinemas or theatres can be creased**T15**Confusion_of_structures**None**47**creation of new cinemas or theatres can be done>>. 

In <<conclusion**T16**Spelling**None**10**conclysion>>, the effect of modern technology impact significantly depends on <<the personality**T17**Articles**None**11**personality>> of people and could be reduced by controlling the usage of modern technology.
