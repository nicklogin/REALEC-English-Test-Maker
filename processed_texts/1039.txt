Nowadays many people download different types of information (for example, music, films, or books) from the Internet illegally. In this reason companies that produce such materials do not earn as much as they can.

There are several opinions about this issue. On the one hand, today individuals consume so much goods of the musical and cinematography sphere that it will be too expensive for them to pay for every downloaded pirate copy. On the other hand, musicians and film producers spend a huge amount of money to create their products, so they need to earn this money from sales.

I agree with the statement that people who do not buy illegal copies of music records or films and download pirate files, should be punished. Despite their opinion that they are able to listen to music and watch films on the Internet for free, this is theft and they are obliged to pay for their crime. More over, a special kind of police should be created to punish such “pirates” and help companies to return money and to not allow to download something without payment.

To draw a conclusion, the pirating in the information and entertainment spheres is a serious issue of modern society. So goverment and authorities shoud do every thing to cope with this problem and make these spheres safe and legal. I believe that in the future we will download everything and pay for it. This will make our society honest and rich.
