Crime is a very sore subject for society and a very lucrative one for shrewd politicians. Each election they appeal to their electorate's pre-existing opinions to manipulate them into voting for "the good guys". In this particular case, the opinion seems to be that it's all the young'uns fault, and that back in the day things were different.

That premise is partially true, of course. Young people do commit more crimes than the mature and elderly. The reason for that is younger people are generally less experienced, and it's perfectly natural for them to drink and drive, act before they think, or to simply succumb to their natural violent urges. Hardcore criminals either get weeded out by natural selection, give up, or get smart and don't get caught anymore. This is how it's been for hundreds of years, this is how it is now, and this is how it'll remain, unless Earth becomes a planet-wide police state.

Parents and teachers are less help to the already-damaged people than they think. Empirical evidence suggests that parents are generally lousy guardians that don't have the first idea about raising a wholesome individual, and teachers are desperate incompetent nags that further distance the youth from self-improvement and healthy self-actualization. The most important thing for parents to do would be to not procreate until they know what to do with their offspring. The teachers can also rethink their career choices unless they are decent people.

In conclusion, the world is a bitter and unfair place, deal with it and carry a mace.
