Every year <<the government**T1**Articles**None**10**government>> and film production companies <<struggle**T2**Tense_choice**None**14**are struglling>> <<because of**T3**Prepositions**None**4**with>> illegal distribution of copies of films, music, books and other forms of art. Some people disagree with <<a decision to punish those who spread that illegal content**T4**Absence_explanation**None**13**this decision>> because of many reasons.
First of all, there is a group of <<people who stand for free access to any form of art**T5**Defining**None**52**people, who stand for free access to any form of art>>. The main function of <<a film**T8**Articles**None**4**film>> or a song is to contain a special message, and the more people get this <<message,**T9**Punctuation**None**7**message>> the better for <<a song**T10**Articles**None**4**song>> or film. Actually, it is an old tradition of <<spreading**T11**lex_item_choice**None**12**distribution>> songs or fairy tales from one person to another, from one speaker to another. <<Personally,**T12**Punctuation**None**10**Personally>> I agree with such method, because it has <<a positive effect**T13**Articles**None**15**positive effect>>. When people share ideas, then they can create something new <<, and**T14**Punctuation**None**3**and>> different restrictions stop the process of creation.
In addition, many experts claim that it is hard to stop and control the process of making copies and <<the number of people**T15**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**15**how many people>> <<downloading**T16**Category_confusion**Dependent_change**8**download>> them. Moreover, it will be very expensive and, as a result, <<a price**T17**Articles**None**9**the price>> <<of**T18**Prepositions**None**3**for>> a disk will dramatically rise. It will lead to <<decrease**T19**Category_confusion**None**10**decreasing>> of revenue <<of**T20**Prepositions**None**3**for>> film producers and film companies.
Also, if they try to control distribution of copies and rise <<prices**T21**Noun_number**None**9**the price>>, there is a probability that <<an author**T22**Articles**None**10**the author>> of <<a film**T23**Articles**None**8**the film>> or song will not get this money, <<because**T24**Spelling**None**7**becouse>> <<it will be spent**T25**Tense_form**None**18**it will be spended>> on the control system. A few years ago there was a scientific work about <<the Hollywood’s economics**T27**Articles**None**21**Hollywood’s economics>>. The results <<showed**T28**Tense_choice**None**4**show>><< that**T29**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> the most important field of <<economics**T30**Spelling**None**8**economic>> were <<the sales**T31**Category_confusion**None**7**selling>> of pop-corn and Coca-Cola. It practically means that there is no reason for implementing restrictions of distributing <<pirate copies**T32**Absence_explanation**None**6**copies>>.
In conclusion, many people do not believe that it is possible to punish “free-riders”, as it will be extremely hard, difficult and expensive <<to at least find them**T33**Standard**None**21**to find them at least>>.
