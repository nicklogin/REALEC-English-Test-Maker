The diagram <<gives**T1**lex_item_choice**None**11**illustrates>> information about the number of <<printed**T2**Category_confusion**None**5**print>> and eBook sold in <<the USA**T3**Articles**None**3**USA>>, Germany, China and <<the UK**T4**Articles**None**2**UK>> in 2014 and makes a prediction for situation in the book market in <<these**T5**Pronouns**None**4**this>> countries in 2018.
In 2014 the amount of sold <<printed**T6**Category_confusion**None**5**print>> books in all countries was always higher then the number of sold <<eBooks**T7**Noun_number**None**5**eBook>>. There <<are**T9**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> no #DELETE#3#one following <<trends**T23**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**trend>> in 2018, because, according to given forecast, in <<the USA**T12**Articles**None**3**USA>> and <<the UK**T13**Articles**None**2**UK>> people would predominantly buy <<electronic**T14**Spelling**None**11**electronick>> books, while in Germany and China they would still prefer printed ones. <<The USA**T15**Articles**None**3**USA>> is absolute leader with the largest amount of billion dollars spent in the book market in 2014 as well as in 2018. In 2014 the number of billion US dollars spent on <<printed**T16**Category_confusion**None**5**print>> books was about <<twice**T17**Spelling**None**5**twise>> higher than on eBooks.

Situation with the development of the book <<market**T19**Spelling**None**5**marke>> in Germany remained almost stable during this period: the amount of selling eBooks would rise a bit, but not dramatically. Almost the same situation <<is represented**T20**Voice**None**11**represented>> in China: print books are on the top of the book market in 2014 as well as they <<will**T21**Tense_choice**None**5**would>> be in 2018. In the UK in 2014 both types of books are relevant, but the top position <<will change**T22**Tense_choice**None**17**would be changing>> from 2014 to 2018. In 2014 people mostly <<preferred**T24**Tense_choice**None**6**prefer>> <<printed**T23**Category_confusion**None**5**print>> books, while in 2018 - eBooks.
