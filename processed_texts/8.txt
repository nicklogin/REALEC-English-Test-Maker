The bar chart shows levels of unemployment in the whole world and in some particular regions, <<like**T1**Prepositions**None**2**as>> Northern Africa, <<the Middle East**T2**Articles**None**11**Middle East>>, <<the European Union**T3**Articles**None**14**European Union>>, Latin America and Southern Asia.
First of all, we should <<notice**T4**Punctuation**None**7**notice,>> that <<the worldwide level of unemployment**T5**Articles**None**31**worldwide level of unemployment>> in 2015 remained <<just**T7**lex_item_choice**None**17**on the same stage>> as it was in 2014 – 5,9%. However, this does not <<mean**T9**Punctuation**None**5**mean,>> that nothing <<changed**T10**Tense_choice**None**11**has changed>>. (Nothing <<changed**T11**Tense_choice**None**11**has changed>> only in Northern Africa and <<Southern Asia**T13**Spelling**None**6**S.Asia>>).
The worldwide unemployment <<rate**T12**lex_item_choice**None**10**percentage>> <<was**T14**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> the same due to <<a decrease**T16**Articles**None**8**decrease>> of it in <<some**T15**lex_item_choice**None**3**one>> regions and <<an increase**T17**Articles**None**8**increase>> in <<others**T18**Articles**None**10**the others>>. For instance, there <<was**T19**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> <<a slight growth of the unemployment rate**T20**Articles**None**38**slight growth of the unemployment rate>> in <<the EU**T33**Articles**None**2**eu>> from 7,5% to 7,9%. On the contrary, in the Middle East and Latin America there <<was**T23**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> <<a serious decline**T24**Articles**None**15**serious decline>> in this rate – from 11% to 9,6% and 6,8% to 5,8%, <<respectively**T25**lex_item_choice**None**11**accordingly>>.
Despite the <<fact**T26**Punctuation**None**5**fact,>> that in 2 regions there <<were**T27**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> <<decreases**T28**Noun_number**None**8**decrease>> of unemployment levels and <<an increase**T29**Articles**None**8**increase>> in another <<one,**T30**Punctuation**None**4**one.>> <<the**T31**Capitalisation**None**3**The>> worldwide level <<remained**T32**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> the same, as it was mentioned above. This could happen because of overpopulation of the region of Southern Asia, therefore it <<could**T33**Tense_choice**None**3**can>> affect the rate in a significant way.
