The given <<pie charts**T1**Spelling**None**10**pie-charts>> represent the <<number**T2**lex_item_choice**None**6**amount>> of materials and products <<delivered**T3**Spelling**None**10**delievered>> by rail or road in Eastern Europe in 2008. It is obvious that the number of manufactured goods <<delivered**T5**Spelling**None**10**delievered>> by rail is quite close to the number of the same goods <<delivered**T4**Spelling**None**10**delievered>> by road, while machinery products are mostly transported by rail.
Overall, the charts give us a picture of the delivery of some eatable products between all of <<Eastern European countries**T7**Articles**None**30**the Eastern European countries>>. For example, <<the number of products transported by using cars or some other road vehicles is 30%**T9**Standard**None**83**the number of products is 30% transported by using cars or some other road vehicles>>, whilist only 11% is <<comprised of**T20**Word_choice**None**16**consumpted after>> rail delivery. It is shown by the graph that the machinery products are mostly transported by <<rail**T12**Category_confusion**None**5**rails>><< as well as**T14**Punctuation**None**12**, as well as>> the same goods that were transported by car<< were**T15**Punctuation**None**6**, were>> only 2 percent against 12 percent of the previous type of <<the transportation**T13**Articles**None**14**transportation>>.
It is clear that the manufactured type of products is <<sent**T16**Voice**None**4**send>> to <<other**T17**lex_item_choice**None**7**another>> countries both by rail and road on <<an**T11**Articles**None**1**a>> equal level, but products like food were <<sent**T18**Voice**None**4**send>> mostly by road<< rather**T19**Punctuation**None**8**, rather>> than rail. Therefore, the railways and trains are used to deliver machinery goods.
