Nowadays, cheating in sport becomes very common, especially on the Olympic games. People try to discourage <<sportsmen from using illegal drugs**T347**Absence_explanation**Dependent_change**4**them>> by banning <<those who were caught**T348**Ref_device**Dependent_change**9**sportsmen>> from competiting for 2 years. But there are <<those who**T349**Defining**None**10**those, who>> argue that such athletes should be banned forever and never be welcome in sport. I think<< that**T350**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> the second point of view is more appropriate, as it <<guarantees**T351**Spelling**None**8**garatees>> other sportsmen that there will be no cheating. Anyway, in this essay <<both points of view will be discussed**T352**Standard**None**37**will be discussed both points of view>>.
Some people <<claim**T354**Spelling**None**4**clam>> that sport nowadays becomes very popular and almost everyone has <<his or her**T368**Pronouns**None**3**its>> favourite type of competing. For instance, there are lots of fans of football or tennis. <<Those who watch a competition or a match**T355**Defining**None**42**Those, who watch a competition or a match,>> <<take**T359**Tense_form**None**5**takes>> it like a show. They <<get used to**T360**Absence_comp_colloc**None**7**used to>> the main "characters" and sportsmen become familiar. Usually, people trust them, but in many cases they are not even interested whether their favourite athlete <<uses**T361**Tense_form**None**3**use>> drugs or not. It is a crucial issue, because people really do not focus on it and are not going to overcome it. Such people claim that athletes should not be banned at all or should be banned for a limited period. I <<strongly disagree**T362**Category_confusion**None**20**am strongly disagree>> with <<this**T363**Agreement_errors**None**5**these>> point of view, because there is no <<guarantee**T364**Spelling**None**8**garantee>> in this situation that athletes will not be cheating in future.
There are <<those who**T365**Defining**None**10**those, who>> understand the importance of this problem. People claim that sportmen should be banned for the rest of their lives. In this case using illegal drugs will not be flourish and sport will be safe. <<Sportsmen**T366**Spelling**None**8**Sportmen>> and other people will be sure that it is a fair game. I consider that this is the main feature of sport and fair game should not underestimated. Obviously, athletes who use <<illegal**T367**Spelling**None**6**llegal>> drugs should be banned forever.
To conclude, there are different points of view, but people should understand that cheating in sport must be banned.
