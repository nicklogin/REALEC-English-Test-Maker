The whole world's existence people have had a problem which could not be resolved ever - crimes. Nowadays several serearches revealed that young people commite more and more crimes than before.In this essay I would look at this issu at different angles.
The world is a cruel place and it have never had mercy for anyone. People commite crimes due an enormous anumber of causes: someone just want to survive, another one is simply greedy and the third one could be mentaly ill. No one can know for sure what forces the young to commite crimes more and more, however i have an idea.
My idea is that young people could be protesting. Today we have a lot of changes, especially in politics. People just go outside and they want to be heard by state, but often long and harsh protest are inevitable to break silence and grab attention to serious issues. Nowadays there are an abundance of the young who protsets.Recently, in Russia we had such big protests at 26 of march and there were a lot of young people. How it is related to crimes? Then you are in a group you feel safe and can do some mad deeds which are definetly crimes.This is my point of view and of course it is not the only root of evil.
What can do parents and teachers? They take a major role is socialisation of cheldren and teenagers. The best thing they can do - teach their children what is good and what is bad and actualy participate in their life.
All in all,personaly, I believe that proper education is a true cure to hemanity's problems.
