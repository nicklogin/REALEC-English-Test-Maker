On the Earth there are a lot of countries with radically different <<climates**T1**Noun_number**None**7**climate>>. Everybody knows that some plants need #DELETE#2#in special weather conditions. It means that countries often focus on products<< which are easier to make and exchange**T3**Defining**None**35**, which are easier to make exchange>> with other regions #DELETE#33#and after it have variety of food. However, some people claim that <<it is**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> <<a wrong way**T7**Articles**None**9**wrong way>>, they believe that <<countries**T8**Noun_number**None**7**country>> should import as little as possible. I absolutely disagree with this opinion. In my essay <<I will**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**4**I’ll>> try to explain why I think so.

Firstly, <<it is**T10**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> doubtless, that we <<cannot**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> do everything perfectly, but when we need to do just a few things instead of <<a great amount**T12**Articles**None**12**great amount>>, <<it is**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> easier to achive <<a good quality**T14**Articles**None**12**good quality>>. So, I believe that <<it is**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> <<a good idea**T16**Articles**None**9**good idea>> to share what you can do and take what others can do. It can <<make**T17**Agreement_errors**None**5**makes>> <<relationships**T18**Noun_number**None**12**relationship>> between countries better. And there is a <<possibility**T19**lex_item_choice**None**11**probability>> that if you <<do not**T20**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> want to buy something, then you <<cannot**T21**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> sell <<your own**T22**Absence_explanation**None**3**own>> production. It is bad for economic of country. 

The second argument in favor of my point of view is people’s health. Humans need #DELETE#2#in different types of food to provide <<their own**T24**Absence_explanation**None**3**own>> well-being. But if countries <<do not**T25**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> make an exchange, you <<will not**T26**Tense_choice**None**7**haven’t>> some products with special consistence. For example, in countries where always cold temperature there are no any plants and it is bad for people, they <<don not**T27**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> get a lot of necessary vitamins. 

In conclusion, <<I would**T28**Inappropriate_register**None**3**I’d>> like to add<< that**T29**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> people <<should not be afraid**T31**Absence_comp_sent**None**17**should not afraid>> of cooperation of countries, it is always good to have close and kind relationships. Moreover, it would be interesting for us to have such opportunity to try the best products which other countries can make.
