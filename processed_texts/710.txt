It is undeniable that nowadays <<planes**T4**Spelling**None**6**plains>> and air travel in general are a big part of our lives. Thousands of people every day use air transport to travel: to visit their family, attend a buisness meeting or to have a vacation <<somewhere**T19**Spelling**None**8**somwhere>> far away from home.
It is an unfortunate thing, of course, that right now humanity is doing its best to destroy the beautiful planet they inhabit. Every minute the poisonous gas p<<pollutes**T14**Spelling**None**7**polluts>>the air, toxic materials are being thrown into the g<<soil**T15**lex_item_choice**None**6**ground>>and in the water. And even if it seems that the government is trying to do something about the matter, Earth is still suffocating. Is paying money (fines or taxes) for an extra f<<flight**T3**Spelling**None**5**fliht>>a good thing? Maybe. If it is a plane with a lot of people inside, they can probably afford to pay a little bit more for the tickets. Some individuals own a<<private jets**T1**Articles**None**14**a private jets>> there w<<are not**T10**Tense_choice**None**11**will not be>>many passengers, but if a person can buy a jet, they can definetely pay a tax.

It is not always easy, trusting your government, that is why paying more for the air transportation can cause protests among the population.
