Some people believe that <<the increase**T32**Articles**None**4**rise>> of <<using of**T3**Prepositions**None**5**using>> modern <<technologies**T4**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> causes the increasing number of health problems.

Actually, there is a number of reasons for this issue. First  and foremost, it is clearly<< that**T5**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> every single person living in <<modern realities**T6**Articles**None**18**a modern realities>> has his or her own smartphone. Nowadays scientists strongly believe that mobile phones can make a huge damage to human’s heath#DELETE#7#-rhythm and eyesight. Secondly, <<it is logical to**T8**Confusion_of_structures**None**7**logisty>> say that a permanent opportunity to get any kind of information you want causes many problems. <<For example,**T9**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> with nerves and human’s phsychology in general. Another major reason is the fact that the level of traffic in modern cities <<has highly increased**T10**Voice**None**19**is highly increased>>. <<It**T11**Ref_device**None**4**This>> causes air pollution, which is also <<dangerous**T12**lex_item_choice**None**10**destroying>> for human’s health. Some researches say that nowadays <<the ozone layer**T13**Articles**None**11**ozone layer>> is already damaged so much<< that**T14**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> we <<cannot**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> even recover it. 

Nevertheless, there are some <<things**T16**lex_item_choice**None**4**ways>> <<people**T17**lex_item_choice**None**8**humanity>> could use to <<reduce**T18**lex_item_choice**None**7**resolve>> these issues. Firstly, we can rearrange <<the transportation system**T20**lex_item_choice**None**16**transporting use>> as more <<eco-friendly**T19**lex_part_choice**None**24**environmentally-friendly>>. For example, international transportations could make their <<transportations**T21**Category_confusion**None**12**transporting>> by using electric transport. Trains nowadays are as fast as cars or ships. This kind of transport is not <<widespread**T22**Spelling**None**12**wedespreaded>> because of the borders and the laws. <<I guess**T23**Punctuation**None**7**I guess>>, governments should think about ecology and open borders for the international railway connection. Another thing that can be done to reduce <<technology's**T24**Possessive**None**10**technology>> damage on our health is <<to try**T25**Infinitive_constr**None**3**try>> to face less mobile phone or a computer in your everyday life. You might use your phone only for <<calling**T26**lex_item_choice**None**10**connecting>> people and a <<computer**T27**Spelling**None**7**compute>> only for work issues, for instance.

To summarise, I would like to say that <<the influence**T28**Articles**None**9**influence>> of widespread <<technologies**T29**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> on our health is not just <<their**T30**Ref_device**None**25**technologies imperfectane>> fault. Personally, I think that it is our own <<choice**T31**Spelling**None**6**choise>>. To <<get**T32**Spelling**None**3**ger>> pleasure and comfort by using our gadgets and have some problems with health or to have a great healthy body, but say ‘no’ to using technologies for your pleasure. Everything has it’s worth and it is up to you to decide.
