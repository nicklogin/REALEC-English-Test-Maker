It is <<believed**T1**lex_item_choice**None**7**thought>><< that**T39**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<creators**T2**Articles**None**12**the creators>> of films and music lose a lot of money due to the fact that <<their products**T40**Word_choice**None**11**these files>> <<are usually copied illegally on the internet**T42**Standard**None**44**usually are copied on the internet illegally>>, that is why some people are sure that such things should be <<persecuted**T38**lex_item_choice**None**7**obliged>>.
On the one hand, musicians and film producers fail to <<receive**T3**Spelling**None**7**recieve>> the money that they should actually <<get**T4**Spelling**None**3**pet>> after their creations were released. What is more, such things are usually posted in poor <<quality**T5**Spelling**None**8**equality>>, thus people who listen to or watch them <<cannot**T43**Spelling**None**7**can not>> realise#DELETE#1#, <<what a great job**T6**Articles**None**14**what great job>> was done to create <<them**T45**Ref_device**None**2**it>>. They will not be able to <<see**T7**lex_item_choice**None**4**face>> the effects the producers <<have appled**T20**lex_item_choice**None**3**use>> in their films, <<to understand**T47**Lack_par_constr**None**10**understand>><< how**T48**Punctuation**None**5**, how>> wonderful <<the sound in the songs is**T49**Standard**None**25**is the sound in the songs>>.
Moreover, if we speak about <<an official purchase**T20**lex_item_choice**None**15**official buying>> in iTunes, for instance, it <<it helps not only people of arts, but also**T9**Absence_explanation**None**10**also helps>> the owners of such platforms to pet money. What is more, due to <<pirate copies**T30**Absence_explanation**None**6**copies>> more people in the whole world will know about the <<content**T11**lex_item_choice**None**5**stuff>> and its producers. This is <<a way**T31**Articles**None**7**the way>> for them to become even more popular.
On the other hand, after watching <<a film**T13**Articles**None**8**the film>> or listening to music on the internet a person may <<decide**T22**Spelling**None**6**deside>> to go to the cinema or buy the song or even the whole album if he or she liked it #DELETE#6#indeed. The fact is that if someone knows that really good things <<have been**T12**Tense_choice**None**4**were>> produced and is sure that <<money**T24**lex_item_choice**None**6**things>> really <<goes**T23**Agreement_errors**None**2**go>> <<to the artists**T28**Absence_explanation**None**9**this way,>> <<creators**T25**Articles**None**12**the creators>> will <<receive**T14**Spelling**None**7**recieve>> even <<more**T15**Comparative_constr**None**4**much>> money.
All in all, it seems that <<producers**T16**Articles**None**13**the producers>> <<do not lose as much money**T17**Negation**None**19**lose too much money>> because of <<illegal copying**T34**Absence_explanation**None**7**copying>> as <<it**T18**Spelling**None**2**at>> <<seems**T32**lex_item_choice**None**10**is thought>>. <<Shared news**T20**Word_choice**None**10**The spread>> of their creativity may make them very famous and rich indeed. <<If a person is popular for things he or she does,**T35**Punctuation**None**48**If a person is popular for things he or she does>> <<it**T36**Pronouns**None**4**that>> will <<enable him or her**T20**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**enable>> to produce more new extraordinary films and songs. Finally, it seems that there is no serious reason for trying to prevent <<illegal copying**T20**Absence_explanation**None**7**copying>>.
