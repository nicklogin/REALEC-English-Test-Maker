The 21’th century <<is**T1**Spelling**None**2**us>> the century of technologies. The development of <<technologies**T2**Discourse**None**2**it>> can bring us to some problems with #DELETE#6#people health. This controversial issue should be <<discussed**T4**Voice**None**10**discussing>>.

Nowadays <<we all**T5**lex_item_choice**None**9**all of us>> <<have**T6**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> modern <<gadgets**T7**Spelling**None**7**gedjets>>, mobile phones and laptops. We <<cannot**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> imagine how our parents <<could live**T10**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**lived>> without <<them**T9**Ref_device**None**2**it>>. It is clearly seen<< that**T11**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> technologies play a great role in our <<lives**T12**Spelling**None**5**lifes>>. However, spending a lot of time in the <<Internet**T13**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> or <<in**T14**Prepositions**None**4**with>> computers can <<lead to**T15**lex_item_choice**None**8**increase>> health <<problems**T17**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> #DELETE#9#of people. Firstly, it is dangerous for our <<eyesight**T18**Spelling**None**3**yes>>, nowadays <<many**T20**lex_item_choice**None**16**a huge number of>> young people <<have to wear**T19**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**have>> glasses. <<The other**T21**Often_confused**None**7**Another>> key point <<is connected**T22**Voice**None**10**connecting>> with children. They <<prefer**T23**Spelling**None**7**prefere>> video games to walking <<on the street**T24**Prepositions**None**10**the street>>. Therefore children have problems with <<eyes**T25**Spelling**None**3**yes>>, bones and <<overweight**T26**Spelling**None**9**overweigh>>. Also, they <<are not interested**T28**Voice**None**19**are not interesting>> in communication with each other. Moreover, <<a headache**T55**Spelling**None**6**hadake>> is a big problem of modern people, it is also <<happens because**T55**Spelling**None**6**becose>> of computer waves and <<the decrease**T33**Articles**None**8**decrease>> of oxygen.

It is clearly seen that people should <<pay attertion to**T34**Prepositional_verb**None**16**pay attention on>> their <<health**T35**Spelling**None**5**helth>>. Firstly, some <<exercises**T36**Spelling**None**9**exercised>> can help you #DELETE#5#still <<to be active**T37**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**active>> and <<do not**T39**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> tide. Secondly, you should have a rest every 20 minutes<< when**T40**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> you work <<is connected**T42**Voice**None**10**connecting>> with computer. Thirdly, try to change you activity, <<because**T55**Spelling**None**7**becouse>> it is the best rest, short <<walks**T45**Category_confusion**None**7**walking>> or <<talks**T46**Noun_number**None**4**talk>> are <<good ways**T51**Articles**None**11**a good ways>> to relax.

In conclusion, it #DELETE#2#is seems, that nowadays technologies <<are**T48**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> a great part of our <<lives**T49**Spelling**None**5**lifes>> and we <<cannot**T50**Spelling**None**4**cant>> live without <<them**T52**Ref_device**None**2**it>>, but problems with health can be <<dramatic**T53**Category_confusion**None**12**dramatically>>. We should remember about out health, do some exercises, go for a walk and communicate with other people. I hope that in the <<future**T54**Spelling**None**5**futer>> people will learn to <<unite**T55**lex_item_choice**None**5**merge>> their work and activities and understand that health is more important than work.
