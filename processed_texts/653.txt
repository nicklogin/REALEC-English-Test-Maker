The given <<pie charts**T1**Spelling**None**10**pie-charts>> provide data on the <<transferring**T2**Spelling**None**11**transfering>> of goods in some countries of Eastern Europe by rail and by road in 2008.It is <<notable**T3**Category_confusion**None**7**notably>> that trains largely <<transported**T4**Spelling**None**13**transportated>> metals, while cars and trucks more dealed with food products.
According to the charts, it is clear that heavy goods like metals, manufactured goods and machinery have been t<<transported**T5**Spelling**None**13**transportated>>by railway. On the c<<contrary**T6**Spelling**None**7**contary>> the roads were mostly used to move food and non-metallic minerals. However, the amount of manufactured goods and chemical products are nearly equal in terms of the way of t<<transferring**T7**Spelling**None**11**transfering>>
It is remarkable, << that**T8**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>he use of trains to transport machinery is quite ahead of the use of cars: in 2008 there has been 12% of tr<<transferred**T9**Spelling**None**10**transfered>>achinery by rail, while only 2% of it has been moved by road.
