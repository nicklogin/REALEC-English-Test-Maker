<<The charts in the task**T10**Absence_explanation**None**12**These charts>> show information about the transportation of goods by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. Overall, it can be seen that the charts are quite different. To begin with, we can <<observe**T7**lex_item_choice**None**7**witness>><< that**T1**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> the <<percentage**T2**Category_confusion**None**7**percent>> of metals and food products is far higher <<in**T11**Prepositions**None**2**at>> the second chart, while the <<percentage**T3**Category_confusion**None**7**percent>> of machinery is far higher <<in**T12**Prepositions**None**2**at>> the first chart <<, which**T13**Non_defining**None**5**which>> illustrates goods transported by rail. Interestingly, #DELETE#4#that the parts which are called "manufactured goods" and "chemicals" have fairly similar <<percentage**T4**Category_confusion**None**7**percent>> on both charts. Comparing the chart which <<illustrates**T5**Agreement_errors**None**10**illustrate>> goods transported by road with the chart "goods transported by rail" we can <<notice**T6**lex_item_choice**None**7**witness>> a <<decrease in**T15**Prepositional_noun**None**11**decrease of>> the <<percentage**T8**Category_confusion**None**7**percent>> of non-metallic minerals <<in**T16**Prepositions**None**2**at>> the first chart (6% <<in**T17**Prepositions**None**2**at>> the first chart and 13% <<in**T18**Prepositions**None**2**at>> the <<second).**T9**Punctuation**None**7**second)>> To conclude, the most popular goods among those #DELETE#5#which transported by rail are metals and manufactured goods, while the most popular goods among those #DELETE#5#which transported by road are food products and also manufactured goods. These charts have some common features, though this #DELETE#5#trend <<may have changed**T22**Tense_choice**None**15**may be changing>>
