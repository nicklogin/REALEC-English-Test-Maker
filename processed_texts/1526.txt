Nowadays situation, where sportmans use illegal drugs are not rare. One people think, that athlets should be banned from competing for a over 2 years or more. Other peoples consider that sportsmans should not participate in competitions all their life. Let's discuss about this situation.
On the one hand, all people in the world make mistakes, but they studies on their fails and improve themself. If sport judges banned athletes from professional competition for the rest of their lives it will be broke all life of athlets, because it was a way of eean money for family! No doubt, people should think about moral side of problem. Also, no everyone can achieve a professional level of career and situation, when one mistake can destroy all hard-working goals is horrible! There are many situations and examples when coach give illigal drugs to athletes without their opinion, because their main goal is victory and health of sportsman on the second plan. In such situations for athletes there are not other ways.
On the other hand, rules for all are similar. Sportsmens should follow honour game. Serious banned will be good example for other athletes. This is a good lesson for other people, which can prevent using of illegal drugs in sport. The conditions in sport should be common for all. To my mind, it is necessary to give people a second chance. But if mistake will be repeat, athletes should be banned from compenting professionally for the rest of their lives
To conclude, this problem is not solve, while people produce illegal drugs. it is important to destroy the reason of problem.
