There is an opinion that high technology that <<is implemented**T9**Voice**None**9**implement>> everywhere in today’s world <<affects**T13**Transitive**None**15**effect badly on>> <<people's**T1**lex_item_choice**None**6**public>> health. Well, it is clear that modern technologies change lives including our health. 

The negative influence of modern gadgets can be easily noticied in everyday life. For example, increasing number of people suffer <<from**T2**Prepositions**None**2**of>> <<deteriorating**T14**lex_item_choice**None**8**reducing>> eyesight #DELETE#8#clearing due to the widespread of smartphones or laptops. People spend hours <<staring**T16**Spelling**None**8**starring>> at them without noticing the harm. Another vital problem is obesity. Nowadays people become less and less active because of various means of transport or <<access to distant entertainment**T17**Absence_explanation**None**21**distant entertainment>> <<on the**T18**Confusion_of_structures**None**7**such as>> <<the Internet**T3**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. The need to move disappears when you can live a full life without leaving your house. 

On the other hand, there are many technologies <<developed**T19**Voice**None**10**developing>> to fight these problems. Firstly, there is <<a brilliant gadget**T4**Articles**None**16**brilliant gadget>> that helps us to control physical activity – a fitness <<bracelet**T6**Spelling**None**8**brasetel>>. This little thing makes activities more <<exciting**T5**Spelling**None**7**exiting>> and useful. Secondly, many of the hi-tech corporations are trying to reduce <<the damage of the screens to the eye**T7**Standard**None**29**the eye damage of the screens>>, for example, there are many readers with electronic technology that is much less harmful than ordinary screens. 

To sum up, I can say  that it is totally unfair to blame modern technology for increasing health problems. The <<developers**T8**Spelling**None**10**debelopers>> constantly add different improvements to make it better for use, but the people often become addicted to certain trucks and harm themselves.
