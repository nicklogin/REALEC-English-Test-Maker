Nowadays it is very popular to copy and share stolen music and films on the internet and there are a lot of people who download such files instead of buying <<original discs and cassets**T13**Articles**None**30**the original discs and cassets>>. Therefore, musicians<< and**T14**Absence_comp_sent**None**1**,>> movie producers lose huge parts of income every year because of illegal <<practices**T1**Spelling**None**10**practicies>>, so there is an opinion that people who download pirate copies should be punished.
First of all, there are some arguments against this point of view. Firstly, a lot of people just do not have <<enough**T15**lex_item_choice**None**7**so much>> money to pay for every disc with <<a new song**T4**Articles**None**8**new song>> or film <<, and**T18**Punctuation**None**3**and>> the only solution for them is to download pirate copies. Secondly, <<these practices**T12**Absence_explanation**None**9**practices>> can be beneficial for <<a musician**T7**Articles**None**8**musician>>: information about him or her, <<or his**T19**Linking_device**None**8**his song>> <<spreads**T8**Voice**None**10**are spread>> through the internet and <<his**T21**Absence_explanation**None**3**his>> popularity <<grows**T22**Prepositions**None**8**grows up>>. Last but not least, a lot of people simply do not know that they download illegal pirate files so it is hard to blame them.
However, there are some people who agree with this opinion and believe that <<punishment**T3**Spelling**None**11**punishement>> for downloading pirate copies <<should be severe**T9**Absence_explanation**None**9**should be>>. First of all, they claim that a lot of films do not receive <<great popularity**T10**Articles**None**18**a great popularity>> in cinemas just because of <<a possibility**T11**Articles**None**11**possibility>> to watch them on the internet illegally. Secondly, pirate copies usually <<are of bad quality and have**T23**Lack_par_constr**None**20**have bad quality and>> viruses <<inside of them**T16**Redundant_comp**None**11**inside them>>, which can lead to <<breakdown of**T2**Category_confusion**None**10**breakaning>> computers and stealing money and personal information. Thirdly, if one does not know the laws it does not mean that <<he**T24**Absence_explanation**None**2**he>> <<can**T25**lex_item_choice**None**6**should>> be considered #DELETE#2#as innocent.
All in all, one should keep in mind these arguments and remember that, despite the advantages of downloading pirate copies, such <<practices**T12**Spelling**None**10**practicies>> are formally illegal.
