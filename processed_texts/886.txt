It is argued that <<a rising number**T1**Articles**None**13**rising number>> of human diseases is caused by using technologies. This essay agrees with this statement. Firstly, this essay will discuss problems with health, and <<, secondly,**T2**Punctuation**None**8**secondly>> ways of reducing these problems. To begin with, modern technologies such as computers, mobile phones <<significantly**T3**Spelling**None**12**significanly>> <<influence**T13**Transitive**None**12**influence on>> health. <<They**T4**Pronouns**None**2**It>> deteriorate our vision. A lot of children suffer from <<problems**T5**Spelling**None**8**promlems>> with their eyes already in the first <<grade**T6**lex_item_choice**None**5**class>>. Secondly, <<gadgets**T14**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>> have devastating effect on <<their owner's**T15**Possessive**None**7**human's>> heart. The impulses <<which gadgets emit**T18**Agreement_errors**None**30**which emitgadgets emitgadgets,>> ruin our nervous system and deteriorate heart <<beat**T19**lex_item_choice**None**6**breaks>>. Furthermore, technologies weaken our organism and as a result <<a huge amount**T20**Articles**None**15**the huge amount>> of harmful substances reach our organism and <<bring about**T21**Prepositional_verb**None**7**deliver>> a lot of illnesses and microbes. <<This**T22**Pronouns**None**5**These>> wide range of problems can be decreased by human efforts. Firstly, people should <<decrease**T8**Spelling**None**8**decraase>> time<< which**T9**Defining**None**7**, which>> they spend with <<gadgets**T10**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>>. It <<reduces**T11**Ref_device**None**6**reduce>> harmful effect on our organism. Secondly, scientists should improve technologies using different details for <<them**T23**Pronouns**None**2**it>>. They can make the screen less devastating <<for**T24**Prepositions**None**2**on>> <<eyes**T25**lex_item_choice**None**6**vision>>. Finally, people can <<increase**T26**Often_confused**None**8**decrease>> distance between them and computers. For instant, individuals can watch movies not only in front of computers or TV, but sitting on <<a sofa**T27**Articles**None**4**sofa>> or not <<nearer than**T28**Comparative_adj**None**4**near>> one <<metre**T12**Spelling**None**4**metr>> in front of it. In conclusion, <<a wide range**T29**Articles**None**10**wide range>> of technologies <<cause**T35**Agreement_errors**None**7**induces>> the big amount of human illnesses. Despite this fact, people are not able to <<give them up**T32**Prepositional_verb**None**11**escape them>> but they can reduce <<the negative effect**T33**Absence_explanation**None**2**it>> using different methods and approaches, which <<have to be**T34**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> created by scientists and ordinary people #DELETE#12#respectively.
