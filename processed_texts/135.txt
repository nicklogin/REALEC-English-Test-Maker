Nowadays young people commit more and more crimes. In my opinion, this tendention is due to growing ambitions of the youth as well as the lack of attention from their parents and teachers. The way to solve this problem is to use the individual approach for each young man or woman.
In modern world we can hear a lot of stories about people who started from the bottom and became very famous or rich. However, not every young man can interprete these facts correctly. They don't understand that these successful people did the great amount of work and they can hear only phrases from them like everybody can do that, so they start to seek for "easy money".
The youth ambitions must be restricted by their parents and teachers. But actually, parents devote their lives to the career nowadays more frequently than ever before. They think that it's teachers' duty to watch after their childrens' minds. However teachers also tend to more the responsibility to the parents, and in this situation nobody is right.
The individual approach to every single teenager is needed. Parents mustn't think that it is normal for a young man to be a bit aggressive, proud and ambitious and when they grow up, everything will be OK. They must look at their child not as at a representative teenager but as at an individual with his own life experience and problems. Teachers also shall not close their eyes to the features of individual's character. Because of their profession, they have to work with thousants of young men and they can't precisely say who will be the criminal tomorrow.
Every crime of the young man is the combination of two factors: their ambitions and inappropriate treatment by their parents and teachers. Both factors can be controlled if they forget about the statistics and would use an individual approach for each young person.
