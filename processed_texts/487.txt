The given chart provides information about the average time English men and women of different ages spent doing sports and exercising in 2012.
It can be seen from the first sight that o<<overall**T1**Spelling**None**6**oveall>>amount of time women spent doing sport on regular basis in England in 2012 was almost always smaller than that of men. It can also be seen that the youngest women (16-24 years old) and the oldest ones (over 75 years old) spent twice l<<as little**T7**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**4**less>>time (or even less) exercising t<<as**T8**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**4**than>>men of these ages (114,1 minutes vs. 282,2 minutes and 10 minutes vs. 29,2 minutes respectively). The only example a<<to the contrary**T301**Word_choice**None**21**against this tendency>>can be spotted in the 5#DELETE#3#th two figures standing for the e<<average**T2**Spelling**None**7**everage>>amount of time men and women o#DELETE#10#f the age 55-64 y<<years old**T10**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**years>>spent exercising: in that case the time dedicated to sport o<<by**T3**Prepositions**None**2**of>>women (55,4 minutes) was slightly bigger than that of men (52,7 minutes).
The second most prominent trend is that the average time people spent doing sport in England in 2012 was constantly re<<reduced**T4**Voice**None**8**reducing>>i<<with age**T11**Redundant**None**22**with their age raising>>There is again one co<<counterexample**T5**Spelling**None**13**contr-example>>65-74 ye<<year**T12**Noun_number**None**5**years>>ld men dedicated more of their time (about 60 minutes) than 55-64 years old men (just above 50 minutes).
