Nowadays with the growth of cities we can observe the growth of crime. Modern society demands effective ways of handling with this problem, for instance, the increase of the length of inprisonment. But whether it is a reasonable and beneficial <<decision**T9**Spelling**None**8**desision>> is a controversial issue worth discussing.

Many people claim that if criminals stay in prison for a longer period of time, it would result in the more peaceful life in the city. To begin with, it is quite unlikely that the short punishment might change the person. It is essential to make him/her reflect long enough about the crime they commited and give them time to get ps<<psychological**T8**Spelling**None**12**psyhological>>reatment if needed. In addition, the longer criminals are isolated the safer is the city environment, th<<the more these people do not respect the rules of our society**T7**Absence_comp_sent**None**52**these people do not respect the rules of our society>>nd they do not deserve to be the part of it. Moreover, in prisons people are of<<offered**T6**Spelling**None**6**offeed>>ifferent work-programms, they may even master a new job and later, after a long term become more efficient members of our society.

However, some people do not share this point of view and state that the increased length of inprisonment is not a way out. Firstly, government spends too much money on criminals, wh<< when**T5**Punctuation**None**6**, when>>y live in jail. These resourses could be used on a better purpose. Secondly, the people are different and staying for a long period in a cruel and pressing prison environment might be fatal for week personalities. People will not realise their mist<<mistake**T4**Spelling**None**7**mistace>> the contrary - they can become more violent. Thirdly, with the development of modern psychology, it is possible to create an individual programms for each prisoner, find his/her own way to a new better life.

In conlusion, in a modern society the long isolation of criminals cannot be an effective desision. Personally, I think it is more imporant to find a way to prevent people from becoming criminals. Hopefully, it the<<in**T3**lex_item_choice**None**2**it>>uture the political and economic situations in the country will be improved and people will be satisfied with their lives, because it this case crimes are not nessec<<necessary**T1**Spelling**None**9**nessecary>>
