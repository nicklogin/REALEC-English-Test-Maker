In modern society, the drug problem becomes more and more urgent. It is might be true to say, that illegal drugs get into the sport system. Some athletes use drugs to reach better results, however it is not illegal. There are different views on what should have been done after athletes had been caught. In this essay the views of both sides of this problem will be examined carefully.
Firstly, it is very important to understand that some illegal drugs may be just a medical treatment for athletes, who have some problems with health. In this case they do not try to do something illegal, so the government should more carefully study all kind of drugs to know, which are legal and which are not. This is a viable argument for people, who tend to believe, that the penalty in such case should be not so furious. I strongly have the same point of view.
However, there are people, who think in another way. If a sportsmen uses drugs ones, he will probable do it again. That is why he must be banned from sport for the rest of his live. The whole system of sport competition will brakedown, unless each sportsman has a medical test before the competition. Moreover, we must remember the fact, that the sport system relates on money. The goverment pays a lot of money to winners. So if such athletes become winners illegaly, goverment will unfairly lose money from the budget.
In conclusion, we must take into the consideration both views. I strongly think that the penalty should be not so crucial, however the obvious fact that the penalty must be in all cases.
