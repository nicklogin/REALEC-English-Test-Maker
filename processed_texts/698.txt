In modern society <<crime**T11**Articles**None**9**the crime>> is important and common known <<fact**T40**lex_item_choice**None**5**theme>> as the <<quality**T41**lex_item_choice**Parallel_construction**5**level>> of life <<improves**T42**lex_item_choice**Parallel_construction**9**increases>> <<dramatically**T1**Spelling**None**11**dramaticaly>> but people still <<cannot**T2**Modals**None**7**can not>> feel safe. There can be many points of view <<on**T43**Prepositions**None**2**at>> that problem and different countries choose different methods to reduce crime.
One way of solving the problem is violence as the answer to violence. There can be prison sentences that l<<last**T33**lex_item_choice**None**5**longs>>decades or laws that give o<<an opportunity**T14**Articles**None**11**opportunity>>to k<<execute**T44**lex_item_choice**None**4**kill>>some of the criminals. People who p<<prefer**T15**Spelling**None**7**prefere>>that way believe that it can scare p<<potential**T16**Spelling**None**8**potetial>>criminals so they would be forced to find other w<<ways**T45**Noun_number**None**3**way>>to live t<<without**T46**Prepositions**None**4**than>>breaking the law. Moreover, this way p<<proved**T47**Spelling**None**7**prooved>>its successfullness by decades and centuries of using force to m<<make criminals stay away**T17**lex_part_choice**None**19**make criminals away>>from other people.
The second way of reducing th<<crime**T18**lex_part_choice**None**19**the level of crimes>>s created to solve the main reason of<<for**T48**Prepositions**None**2**of>>o<<most of crimes**T19**Determiners**None**18**most of all crimes>> the lack of money. Th<<It**T49**Pronouns**None**5**There>>s not a secret that many people live ha<<a hard and cruel life**T50**Articles**None**19**hard and cruel life>>ut some of them ha<<do not even have**T21**Modals**None**13**have not even>>p<<an opportunity**T20**Articles**None**11**opportunity>>o change it. Th<<People**T51**Articles**None**10**The people>>hat do not accept long prison sentences believe that laws that protect groups of people who ca<<cannot**T54**Modals**None**7**can not>>rotect themselves, he<<helping those**T52**Prepositions**None**16**helping to those>>ho ne<<need**T23**Tense_form**None**5**needs>>elp and th<<a chance**T55**Articles**None**10**the chance>>o live be<<a better life**T53**Articles**None**11**better life>>could increase the global level of education and le<<improve quality of life**T25**Absence_comp_sent**Parallel_construction**15**quality of life>>More than that, these people propose to help th<<criminals**T56**Articles**None**13**the criminals>>o<<solve**T57**Infinitive_constr**None**8**to solve>>h<<their**T4**Pronouns**None**4**they>>roblems and make them feel really sorry for the th<<things they have done**T5**Redundant_comp**None**26**things that they have done>>o their victims and pay for it. It would also reduce le<<crime**T6**Redundant**None**14**level of crime>>ust because there would not be th<<those**T7**Spelling**None**6**thouse>>ho do<<do**T26**Tense_form**None**4**does>>ot see ot<<another**T8**Adjectives**None**5**other>>ay to solve their problems.
In <<In my opinion,**T9**Punctuation**None**13**In my opinion>>th methods have the<<problems**T58**Pronouns**None**14**their problems>>ch as ris<<the risk**T33**Noun_number**None**5**riscs>> mis<<mistake**T30**Noun_number**None**8**mistakes>> <<the first way**T31**Prepositions**None**16**of the first way>>d difficulty of the second.To tell the truth, the first way see<<seems fair enough to me**T60**Verb_pattern**None**21**seems fair enoughfair>>cause it provides the<<a revenge opportunity**T33**Articles**None**26**the opportunity of revenge>>r the victims of criminals, while the second way may seem too soft and not effective. To make a conclusion, I think that second way is more effective dur<<in the long term**T10**lex_part_choice**None**20**during the long time>>d it should reconstruct all<<the whole society**T32**Tense_choice**None**15**all the society>> achieve its goal, but it <<it**T35**Redundant_comp**None**20**it is the thing that>>ould hav<<be done**T34**Tense_choice**None**14**have been done>> def<<protect**T36**lex_item_choice**None**6**defend>>eryone and to ris<<help society rise**T38**Verb_pattern**None**12**rise society>> <<to**T39**Prepositions**None**2**at>>e next level of evolution of relationships bet<<among**T33**Prepositions**None**7**between>>mans.
