Some people claim that musicians and film producers lose a lot of their money because of pirating, and #DELETE#2#so people who download illegal files<< instead of**T2**Punctuation**None**12**, instead of>> paying money for <<the original product**T3**Articles**None**16**original product>>, should be punished. There are different points of view on this subject. There are strong reasons to agree with this point of view, but I <<cannot**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> agree completely. 

It goes without saying<< that**T5**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> pirating things is a crime, which is stated in <<the law**T6**Articles**None**3**law>> of almost <<every**T7**lex_item_choice**None**3**any>> country, and breaking <<the law**T8**Articles**None**5**a law>> leads to punishment. Many big companies, for example, Disney, have sued other small companies and individual freelance users for downloading and <<selling**T9**lex_item_choice**None**7**sharing>> their movies among others for lower price. There is a good reason for <<that**T10**Ref_device**None**2**it>> – <<those**T11**Ref_device**None**4**ones>> who <<pirate**T12**Tense_choice**None**7**pirated>> their movies, <<make**T13**Tense_choice**None**4**made>> money by selling them to other people. Another argument to punish pirates <<is not connected with**T15**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**is not by>> <<big corporations**T16**Absence_explanation**None**11**corporation>> problems, but small ones. If <<a famous musician**T17**Articles**None**19**the famous musician>> loses some money because of illegal copying, she or he still makes a lot of money and <<stays**T18**Agreement_errors**None**4**stay>> as popular as she or he was, where smaller artists, so called indimusicians, <<do not**T19**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> earn much money and pirating makes their income so low<< that**T20**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> eventually they are forced to quit the career. 

On the other hand, illegal pirate copies might <<be**T21**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> good for some artists. There are quite a lot of people who decide to actually buy a music album or movie disc after <<listening to**T22**Prepositional_verb**None**9**listening>> or watching <<the illegal copy**T23**Articles**None**12**illegal copy>>, and they <<would not**T24**Inappropriate_register**None**8**wouldn’t>> buy it #DELETE#2#in another way, because they <<were not**T26**Inappropriate_register**None**7**weren’t>> sure if it is good or not. Also, sometimes media products are overpriced, so some people <<cannot**T33**Tense_choice**None**8**couldn’t>> afford it. Of course, these are not essential human needs, but in modern world, where media surrounds society and every individual, it is difficult to resist on psychological level – person <<needs to stay**T29**Category_confusion**None**21**feels need in staying>> tuned. 

In conclusion, pirating music and movies is illegal and should be punished, but there are some reasons why people who do this <<should not**T30**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn’t>> be judged<< by**T31**Punctuation**None**4**, by>> people who <<do not**T32**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>>, #DELETE#9#to harsh, as there are some nuances in modern society that lead people to stealing things on the Internet.
