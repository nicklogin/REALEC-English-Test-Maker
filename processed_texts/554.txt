There is a main <<trend**T1**lex_item_choice**None**8**tendancy>> in film industry all over the world that British and American films are more popular than films produced by local industries. It is also considerable that if a government would spend more money to support local film industries <<,**T2**Conjunctions**None**4**then>> films produced would be more <<preferred**T3**Spelling**None**8**prefered>>.
Today, E<<Ebglish-speaking**T4**Category_confusion**None**16**English-language>>culture became a world pop-cilture, so American and British films are also watched by people to improve their English. But if it was only about language, people would also watch Australian and South African films. There are some reasons for English and Americans films being more popular all over the world. For example, biggest film-producing corporations are situated in U<<the US**T5**Articles**None**2**US>> so it is obvious that in U<<the US**T6**Articles**None**2**US>>are produced many more films e<<especially**T7**Spelling**None**10**espetially>>hero-movies, trillers, comedies and dramatical ones. All those films became a part of international pop-culture and if you watch, for example, superhero films you always have a topic to discuss with someone who has absolutely different local culture than you and who lives on the other side of our planet.
The quality of film does not correlate with money spent on it so much: there ar<<is**T8**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> huge number of great and popular low-budget films. There is a popular opinion that locally produced films are more specific for the country where they were produced, for example, what is filmed in Balkan countries hardly would be understanded by West European people for language shifts and life style. And it is also co<<considerable**T9**Spelling**None**12**conciderable>>hat local films are more abstract and experimental, so the cultural background is really important.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the world popular culture has a very big influence on local films. Those folms which would be understood by people all over the world would be more popular.
