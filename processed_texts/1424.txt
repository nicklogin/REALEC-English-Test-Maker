It is <<commonly**T1**Spelling**None**9**commonely>> <<believed**T2**Spelling**None**7**belived>> that the <<widespread**T3**Spelling**None**11**widesperead>> use of new <<technologies**T4**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> <<influences**T6**Transitive**None**12**influence on>> people’s health and make <<the number**T41**Articles**None**9**an amount>> of health problems bigger.

This <<theory**T9**Spelling**None**5**teory>> <<has**T10**Tense_form**None**4**have>> a <<place**T11**Spelling**None**5**plase>> to be in our modern world. The dramatic increase of new <<technologies**T12**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> is <<the cause**T13**Articles**None**7**a cause>> of people’s <<worries**T14**Noun_number**None**5**worry>>. Technology <<has**T15**Tense_form**None**3**had>> a very big <<in**T16**Prepositions**None**17**part of our lives>> and it happened <<too**T17**Spelling**None**2**to>> fast. And we <<cannot**T18**Spelling**None**7**can not>> be <<sure**T19**Spelling**None**5**soure>> that all of <<these**T20**Ref_device**None**4**this>> <<gadgets**T21**Spelling**None**6**gadjes>> were <<made**T22**lex_item_choice**None**4**chak>> <<in a good quality**T23**Absence_explanation**None**4**well>>. Maybe the influence of widespread use of <<these**T24**Ref_device**None**4**this>> <<technological devices**T25**lex_item_choice**None**10**technology>> on our health will be <<presented**T26**lex_item_choice**None**6**showen>> in future. Now many health problems <<are**T27**Tense_choice**None**4**were>> linked with <<widespread technologies**T28**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**widespread>>. The main problem is cancer. The <<number**T29**lex_item_choice**None**6**amount>> of people that have this <<disease**T30**Spelling**None**6**desise>> <<has gradually risen**T33**Tense_choice**None**17**is gradually rose>> by <<the last years**T34**Articles**None**10**last years>>. Some people <<believe**T35**Spelling**None**6**belive>> that <<of that**T36**Absence_explanation**None**9**the cause>> is radiation. Also people <<lose**T37**Spelling**None**5**loose>> their hair and and <<teeth**T38**Spelling**None**5**teath>>. There are a lot of children with problems of development. 

The situation that we have can <<lead**T39**lex_item_choice**None**5**leave>> to many problems in future. The population of the planet will become lower or we <<will just not have**T40**Word_order**None**18**just will have not>> <<enough**T41**Spelling**None**5**enath>> food.
