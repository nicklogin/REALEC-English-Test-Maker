On the given bar chart one can observe % of online adults in the USA by age group who use listed social networks: Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. This cart reflects that overall Facebook is the most popular amongst these three, since in each age strata it has bigger percentage number. As for the age popularity distribution, Facebook is mostly used by younger people, demonstrating decline from 87% of Internet users in 18-29 age group down to 56% in 65+ age group. The same tendency is fair for Instagram, however there is much more difference between yang and elderly people, and it is notable even if one compares 18-29 group with 30-49 group - 53% against 25%. People aged 50+ have tiny intrest in Instagram, given 11% for 50-64 age group and 6% for 65+. LinkedIn, on the other hand, has smaller variance of popularity measure between different ages, with the smallest of 22% for 65+ and largest 31% for 30-49 and does not correspond with the same trend as Facebook and Instagram - the highest values are represented by 30-49 and 50-64 age groups. To sum up: LinkedIn has gained more users than Instagram in every strata, except for the 18-29, where Instagram has % of users now that doubled in comparison with LinkedIn.
