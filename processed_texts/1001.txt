Entertainment industry has always been popular. Since the days of ancient theaters in Greece people seek joy in all kinds of arts. Unfortunately, with the spread of world wide web illegal copying of music and movies became availiable. Many people avoid paying charges for things they can get for free.

On the one hand, there should not be any special rules and laws for web-crime. On-line stealing and shoplifting have the same nature. A disk from a music store is as valuable as song on the internet. Thus, people who leave a shop with a disk in a pocket should be punished in the same way as those who download music from pirate web-sites. Some people would argue that they are more comfortable with wathching movies at home rather than going to cinema theater. However, there are plenty of sources that offer films for wathching movies at home and at the same time do not violate the law. 

This serveces provide good-quality content with a smaller fee than in cinemas.

On the other hand, punishment is not the best solution to the problem of online-stealing. In some countries ethics play bigger role than laws. It could be more reasonable to make social advertisments that would cover this problem or explain kids in scools why it is wrong to avoid charges. For example, in the USA downloading a free movie may cause public shaming. Meanwhile in Russia you will considered to be a vierd person. if you suggest you friends to pay for a movie in online-cinema, eventhoug there is a low that forbides doing that.

Overall, such problem as pirate web copies exists not because there are no law restrictions but as societieâ€™s moral standarts do not provide a guidance on this occasion. Thus, making punishments more strckt would be worthless.
