The <<pie chart**T1**Spelling**None**8**piechart>> illustrates the transportation of goods by rail and road in <<Eastern**T2**Spelling**None**6**Easter>> Europe countries in 2008. 

Overall, the largest group of <<goods transported**T4**Absence_explanation**None**11**transported>> by rail <<is**T3**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> metals – 35%, while food products are preferred to <<be transported**T5**Voice**None**9**transport>> by road more than other goods.

<<A quarter**T6**Articles**None**11**The quarter>> of goods transported by rail includes manufactured goods. Food products and chemicals are in equal <<proportions**T7**Noun_number**None**10**proportion>> – 11% <<, and**T8**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<machinery goods contain 12% of rail transportation**T9**Standard**None**50**12% of rail transportation contain machinery goods>>. The smallest part of the <<pie chart**T12**Spelling**None**8**piechart>> includes non-metallic minerals.

If we look at the chart of <<the transportation**T13**Articles**None**14**transportation>> by road in <<details**T15**Noun_number**None**6**detail>> <<, we**T14**Punctuation**None**2**we>> can see that the largest group after food products is manufactured goods – 28%. In contrast to <<the rail transportation**T16**Absence_explanation**None**4**rail>>, it is more convenient to transport chemicals and non-metallic minerals by road – 16% and 13% versus 11% and 6% <<in**T17**Prepositions**None**2**of>> the first chart. The proportion of machinery is the smallest – just 2%, that is why we can say that machinery is preferred to <<be transported**T18**Voice**None**9**transport>> by rail.
