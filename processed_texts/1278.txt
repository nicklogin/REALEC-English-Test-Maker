It is commonly asserted that the way modern technologies are used, <<it can cause**T1**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**can cause>> human health problems. This essay eliminates such problems. Some solutions that can prevent health diseases will be given. 

To begin with, the great threat for human existing is nuclear power stations. They are built to get nuclear power which <<is**T2**Tense_form**None**2**be>> transformed to electricity. It is assumed that such power is cheaper than other sources of energy. Nevertheless, the fire and nuclear explosion in the USSR in the 1980s revealed the fact that radiation is harmful for both <<human's**T3**Possessive**None**5**human>> health and nature. Secondly, there are many technologies <<that help to grow**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**to grow>> plants, crops and animals which will go on <<the market's shelves**T5**Absence_explanation**None**6**market>>. Some of <<these**T6**Ref_device**None**3**the>> technologies are supposed to use GMO #DELETE#8#material. But the influence on human consuming such <<products**T8**Category_confusion**None**7**produce>> and animal meat <<has not been studied**T9**Tense_choice**None**14**is not studied>> yet. Some scientists believe that GMO technologies <<must be**T10**Modals**None**10**have to be>> <<prohibited**T11**lex_item_choice**None**9**abandoned>>. <<What is more**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**What more>>, <<factories which are situated in big cities are the treat for human's health**T13**Standard**None**76**the threat for human's health are factories which are situated in big cities>>. #DELETE#5#Fumes they #DELETE#9#evaporate reduce the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere and influence on peopleâ€™s lungs and heart. 

To solve the <<problems mentioned above**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**14**problems above>> there can be some solutions. First of all, scientists, together with a government, have to find <<alternative sources**T19**Articles**None**22**an alternative sources>> of energy. Otherwise, human-kind can see another tragedy in the future. Also, to solve the problem of hunger farmes have to be subssidesed and the landfarms have to be <<increased in numbers**T20**Absence_explanation**None**9**increased>> in order to use <<chemicals**T21**Noun_number**None**8**chemical>> which can  cause serious problems for future generations. Moreover, factories can be moved out of the cities in the places with <<the low level**T22**Articles**None**9**low level>> of population. Also, some fines have to be introduced for extra pollution. Such measures will improve the health of the citizens. 

All in all, some health problems were eliminated. They are caused by the modern technologies which are used nowadays. Solutions given in this essay will help to reduce <<these problems**T23**Absence_explanation**None**8**problems>>.
