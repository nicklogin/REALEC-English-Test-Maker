Now people can find <<all**T1**Prepositions**None**6**all of>> the information just using the Internet. There are lots of books, films, music and so <<on**T2**Spelling**None**3**one>>. But lots of these copies are illegal and free â€“ people can just download something, but authors and musicians will not get some money for it. It is <<a really big problem**T3**Articles**None**18**really big problem>>. Authors try to find some way to prevent <<an illegal download**T4**Articles**None**16**illegal download>> using law. They say that it is <<a theft**T5**Articles**None**5**theft>> and users of <<these**T6**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> files are robbers.
I agree with them, because before musicians or film producers <<do**T7**Tense_choice**None**3**did>> something, they work for a long period of time and spend lots of money. <<For example,**T8**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> some films are made by lots of people, and the <<amount**T10**lex_item_choice**None**8**quantity>> of money for <<these**T9**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> films is more than billions of dollars. Of course, authors want to get some money. Secondly, I want to say<< that**T11**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<music and films are not only work**T12**Abs_comp_clause**None**29**music and films not only work>>, but also an own idea. Authors made something unique, something new for <<people's**T29**Possessive**None**7**peoples>> mind. Thirdly, then musicians or film producers will not get some money, they can not make new master pieces.
<<On**T15**Prepositions**None**4**From>> the other hand, people say<< that**T16**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> musicians and producers have lots of money and if they download just one <<film**T17**Noun_number**None**5**films>>, nothing <<changes**T18**Tense_choice**None**7**changed>>. <<The other reason is that**T19**Abs_comp_clause**None**21**The other reason that>> music, <<films**T21**Spelling**None**6**fillms>>, books are really expensive <<, and**T22**Punctuation**None**3**and>> not all of people can buy them.
I think that for musicians and producers it is their <<job**T23**Often_confused**None**4**work>> and they must get some money. If it is too expensive to buy something, people can go <<to**T24**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the cinema or library to get what they need.
<<In conclusion,**T25**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I want to say<< that**T26**Tense_choice**None**6**, that>> it is work of <<the government**T29**Spelling**None**9**goverment>> to prevent illegal download, because authors are workers, who pay taxes. Illegal download is a crime <<, and**T29**Punctuation**None**3**and>> I see that people need to fix this situation.
