Nowadays musicians and film producers have a real problem with <<illegal copying and sharing their products**T2**Absence_explanation**None**34**copying and sharing their products>>. This problem <<influences**T1**Agreement_errors**None**9**influence>> not only producers <<, but also**T3**Punctuation**None**8**but also>> usual citizens and people who want to get <<original discs**T4**Articles**None**17**an original discs>> and <<other products**T5**Noun_number**None**13**other product>>.
In my opinion, this type of <<spread of content**T6**Prepositional_noun**None**14**spread content>> should be <<prosecuted**T8**lex_item_choice**None**8**punished>>. The first reason for it, <<is that**T10**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**that>> companies <<lose**T11**Tense_choice**None**4**lost>> their profit and <<can lose**T12**Tense_choice**None**8**can lost>> a motivation to create a <<qualitative**T13**Category_confusion**None**7**quality>> product, which can be <<put on the market**T14**lex_item_choice**None**21**produce in the market>>. Secondly, the big <<musical**T15**Spelling**None**8**musicial>> companies lossing the right over their product after that can be problem with 55 other organizations for original. Companies can have <<disagreements**T16**lex_item_choice**None**16**a disagreements.>> <<In**T18**Capitalisation**None**2**in>> the end they must go to <<court**T19**lex_item_choice**None**9**the judge>>, <<and it can actually be bad**T20**Standard**None**22**actually it can be bad>> for <<their reputations**T21**Noun_number**None**10**reputation>>. #DELETE#3#and <<It**T23**Spelling**None**2**it>> <<can lead to losing money**T24**lex_item_choice**None**14**can lose money>> <<that**T25**lex_item_choice**None**5**which>> <<they**T26**Spelling**None**3**thy>> <<may invest into**T27**lex_item_choice**None**18**can to provide for>> <<a new project**T28**Articles**None**11**new project>>. Thirdly, if <<a company**T29**Articles**None**7**company>> <<has**T30**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> a bad reputation on the market <<it**T83**lex_item_choice**None**4**, it>> means that actors and musicians <<may not want to bound**T33**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**may not to bound>> their <<careers**T34**Noun_number**None**6**career>> <<to**T35**Prepositions**None**4**with>> <<it**T36**lex_item_choice**None**4**this>>. <<They**T37**Spelling**None**3**Thy>> cannot be sure that their product will be <<fully**T39**Suffix**None**4**full>> <<presented**T40**Tense_choice**None**7**present>> for the audience<<, because**T41**Punctuation**None**9**. because>> #DELETE#5#it is if <<a part**T43**Articles**None**8**the part>> of film <<is downloaded**T44**Tense_choice**None**16**will be download>> before the day of <<premiere**T45**Spelling**None**7**premier>>, the <<rating**T46**lex_item_choice**None**4**rang>> of company <<may dramatically decrease**T48**Absence_comp_sent**None**21**dramatically decrease>>. The most popular example which can <<prove it**T49**lex_item_choice**None**12**be presented>> #DELETE#25#to show how scandal about <<a show**T83**Noun_number**None**9**is a show>> <<Sherlock**T53**Punctuation**None**8**Sherlock>>, <<the episode of which**T54**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**the episode>> was <<uploaded**T56**lex_item_choice**None**8**download>> <<to**T57**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet <<two days before it's official release**T58**Absence_explanation**None**15**before two days>>, <<and some people**T59**Conjunctions**None**11**some people>> <<saw**T61**Tense_choice**None**9**could see>> this <<episode**T60**Spelling**None**6**epizod>> before <<all the world**T83**Articles**None**30**all the world officially could>>. It was bad for two <<channels**T64**Spelling**None**7**chanels>> <<that**T65**lex_item_choice**None**5**which>> <<broadcasted**T66**lex_item_choice**None**8**provided>> <<the show**T67**Articles**None**4**show>> because the <<director**T68**Spelling**None**6**direct>> of <<the show**T69**Articles**None**4**show>> <<could lose**T71**Tense_choice**None**8**can lost>> their trust #DELETE#21#to the other side for <<could influence**T83**Tense_choice**None**23**, which could influence>> on people.
In conclusion, I would like to say that people who spread #DELETE#11#and sharing illegal pirate copies should be punished <<, because**T75**Punctuation**None**7**because>> their activity <<has an impact**T76**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**impact>> <<on**T77**Prepositions**None**2**in>> #DELETE#9#both side companies <<lose**T83**Tense_choice**None**9**that lose>> profit and trust <<of**T81**Prepositions**None**4**from>> other <<organizations**T82**Noun_number**None**12**organization>> and people. People <<lose**T83**Tense_choice**None**4**lost>> an opportunity to get a good product.
