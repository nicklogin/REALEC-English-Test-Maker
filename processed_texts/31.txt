It is not a secret that producing pirate copies has become a huge problem for musicians and producers as they lose so much money because of this. A lot of people use this opportunity not to <<pay for films or music**T1**Absence_explanation**None**3**pay>>. Some people believe that such dishonest people should be punished whereas others suggest that they just act rationally.
It seems that there is a real rational part in this kind of behaviour. Because of full access to this sort of <<content**T2**lex_item_choice**None**11**information>>, <<that**T3**Often_confused**None**5**which>> people are usually interested in, they sometimes do not have any thoughts about <<an illegal side**T6**Articles**None**12**illegal side>> of what they are doing. They believe that they just download a song, <<while**T7**Conjunctions**None**4**when>> it can be called committing a crime, judging by the law. That is the reason why these people should not be punished. Their aim is not connected with illegal actions at all.
From the other point of view, we can come up with <<a thought**T23**Articles**None**12**the decision>> that people who leak such information are criminals <<, as**T10**Punctuation**None**2**as>> their main purpose <<is not to download**T11**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**15**is not download>> a film and spend their evening sitting on a sofa watching it and just having a good time. They do release music and <<videos**T12**Noun_number**None**5**video>> and help them <<to spread**T13**Voice**None**12**to be spread>>. They hack special services and steal the content. Maybe this is a kind of #DELETE#4#some strike, as these hackers believe that if they have an opportunity to get music and <<videos**T15**Noun_number**None**5**video>> for free because of <<their skills**T16**Absence_explanation**None**6**skills>>, <<they can also spread**T17**Standard**None**20**they also can spread>> it and help other people <<not to pay for it**T18**Absence_explanation**None**10**not to pay>>.
<<Anyway,**T19**Punctuation**None**6**Anyway>> people are more likely to <<use**T20**lex_item_choice**None**19**watch and listen to>> pirate copies for entertainment. They do not really care about the law. when downloading a film. It is more a problem of education <<, as**T21**Punctuation**None**2**as>> we do not realise that our actions are illegal in these moments <<, and**T22**Punctuation**None**3**and>> we should be better taught to feel more sure about things we are doing to keep safe.
To sum it all up, it is necessary to say that it really depends, while talking about punishment. It can be a good idea to become more strict, but, firstly, people should become informed about <<an illegal part**T23**Articles**None**12**illegal part>> of these actions.
