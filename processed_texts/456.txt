It is argued that in our modern time more and more young people prefer to forget about the law and to commit a crime. Their amount is much more than in previous years.
In my view, the most common reason which provokes to commit a crime is a wish of teenagers to show themselves in front of their mates. They do not want to be an ousider in the young group and they try to do something fascinating and wonderful, however they have not got any ideas but for to break the law. People of this age would like to be respectful, that is why they show their power. Our modern mass media also influences on the young brains. Due to abcense of censorship and a large amount of violence, the youth is becoming much more agressive than ever before. They need to get rid of their energy and then they find a way to go out the line.
The most useful way to decrease the amount of young criminals is to allow their extra energy to go in the another place. Theit parents and teachers should motivate them to find a hobby, which is able to take a lot of time. If it is impossible or very complicated for a teenager, the teachers should to increase the amount of extra lessons, to add sport activities after the main school lessons.
To sum up, if a teenager has not got free time, during that he do not want, what to do,he will not be a young offender. Their parents always should show how he is useful for the family and for his friends.
