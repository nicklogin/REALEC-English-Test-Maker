It is clear that musicians and film producers lose a <<lot**T1**lex_item_choice**None**15**gradually value>> of their money <<because of**T2**Prepositions**None**4**from>> illegal pirate copies every year. But often people <<cannot**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> buy a disk<< because**T4**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> they have <<not enough**T5**lex_item_choice**None**8**a little>> money, and disks can crash after some <<time**T6**Noun_number**None**5**times>> of using. So I think that <<it is**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> nor very well, but <<it is**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> <<obviously**T9**lex_item_choice**None**4**true>> a way for <<these**T10**Ref_device**None**4**this>> people. And I agree with them.

But! People <<download**T11**Agreement_errors**None**9**downloads>> copies of films <<on their computers**T12**Prepositions**None**18**in their computers>>, but <<they**T13**Spelling**None**3**the>> can often go to the cinema<< because**T14**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> there are many films <<looking**T15**Gerund_phrase**None**9**look like>> so good and cool on <<a big screen**T17**Articles**None**14**the big screen>>. And often a lot of money comes to the <<cinemas**T18**lex_item_choice**None**5**cassa>>, and <<then**T19**Spelling**None**4**they>> a <<part**T20**lex_item_choice**None**5**piese>> of <<these**T21**Ref_device**None**4**this>> money <<goes**T22**Agreement_errors**None**2**go>> to the authors of <<these**T23**Ref_device**None**4**this>> films. And people often buy disks, if they have special.
