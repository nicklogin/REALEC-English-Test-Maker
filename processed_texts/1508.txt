Nowadays druguse is becoming very popular in sport industry. A lot of sportsmen are using illegal and banned medicines to upgrade their results. Somebody thinks that such "crimes" should cause only temporal disqualification however another people are sure that use of dopping should be punished more radical, they insist on necessity of permanent banning. In this essay i'll try to summ up both of these positions and I'll also will give my point of view on this situation.
Persons who think that athletes caught using dopping should be banned only temporary, for a short limited period insist on two important facts. First: everybody has a right to mistake; of course such "mistakes" should be punished but not for the hole life. Punishment here plays a role of jail were a criminal must think about his mistakes and try to change himself. Second important reason is connected with changings in ban-list of drugs and medicines. Some items could be legal for years but than they become illegal and vica versa some medicines can be deleted from this ban-list. That can cause a lot of problems and misunderstandings. For example last year a lot of russian sportsmen were banned from international competitions because of drug called melldonium, but it is necessary to understand that this medicine was legal for years.
Second point of view is connected with such things as sportsmen's honor and duty. Apologets of these ideas are sure that each sportswoman or sportsman must obey special honor laws not just rules of competitons. For example sportsman mustn't lie or try to break the rules he must behave as a honor man.
In my opinion first point of view is much better than second, because in modern world it is more useful to be very pragmatic and not to try playing in such game as duty or sportsman's honor.
