Nowadays technology is spreading with an enormous speed. A great number of innovations have made our life much easier. However, some people are sure that technology can influence badly on people's health and cause some illnesses.
Firstly, they say that using computers is very harmful for people's eyes. Statisticians report that the number of blind people has increased in past few years and in their opinion correlation is obvious. This problem is especially crucial when children are analyzed. More than a half of population under 10 years in some countries suffer from problems with their eyes. Secondly, some technological innovations can harm ecology, so the water will become polluted and potentially <<harmful.**T1**Punctuation**None**8**harmful;>> Undoubtedly, use of polluted water can cause many infections. Thirdly, some people have fears that technology can cause problems with mental health. For example, when a person plays in a scary game using VR-glasses, he can be harmed by heart attack as the picture is too realistic.
These concerns are taken seriously by the society, so the government <<tries**T2**Tense_form**None**3**try>> to deal with these problems. Speaking about problems with eyes, it is important to mention that governments encourage producers to make screens which won't be harmful for eyes. Many subsidies are given monthly and it is believed that situation will be taken under control soon. Government's measures are effective in dealing with ecological problems too. For example, Chinese government has made special restrictions which banned <<those factories which**T3**Defining**None**22**those factories, which>> caused too much pollution. Now the situation in China is much better. Finally, nowadays all content which can be potentially harmful for customers is labelled, so when problems with mental health are mentioned it's important to <<remember that**T4**Punctuation**None**14**remember, that>> the main cause of heart attacks is human stupidity and only special TV-shows or articles in newspapers can make them more conscious.
To sum up, I want to underline once more that technology helps to make our life much easier. So, the development of technologies should be encouraged. However, it's important not to ignore the problems that can be caused by technological progress and try to find a way to deal with them.
