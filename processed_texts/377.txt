LinkedIn is the least popular of the three websites as the percentage of users of all ages is less than 35. But also it can be clearly seen from the graph that LinkedIn is not used by young people as much as it is used by adults older than 30.<<. The**T4**Punctuation**None**4**.The>>percentage of middle-aged users of LinkedIn is approximately 30 percent, while only 22 percent of young adults are registered on that website.
In general, we can notice that young adults tend to have higher internet activity in social networks than people older 30.
