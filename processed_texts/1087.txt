Nowadays there is a huge debate about problems of copyright. Everyday lot of people try to download, copy or share some media elements on the Internet. Obviously, it is a great mistake.

First of all, my idea is that the problem is in unsufficient legal base of laws which should control all these manipulations with information on the Internet. If there is a law, there will be a punishment for all people who will broke it.

Secondly, government, politicians, lawers, attorneys and other officials should pay their attention into the problem of illegal pirate copies and direct the governmental policy to this direction. Governmental support in this case is the highly important element.

Thirdly, all Internet users should understand that copying or downloading information with the mark C (or with others with same meaning) is illegal. That is why every website should contain at least one paragraph with information why it is illegal (links on particular documents).

Finally, we should change the fact that speaking about the Internet we imagine absolutely free and independent area. This rude mistake leads to idea that every action on the Internet is unreal, but it is not true. Problem of thefting intellectual property is fully shown on the Internet. there is no doubt that without the Internet there were cases like an efficient law base that will control the Internet and punish all users who illegally share and download information. All punishment should be strict and real.

To sum up, thefting intellectual property on the Internet is a serious crime and everybody must understand that it is impossible to get away with it.
