Nowadays modern <<technologies**T1**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> <<are widely used**T2**Agreement_errors**None**14**is widely used>> around the world and some people are sure <<they**T3**Ref_device**None**2**it>> can damage <<our health**T4**Absence_explanation**None**6**health>> and increase the number of <<diseases**T5**Spelling**None**8**deseases>>.

Cancer is a huge problem and <<it is**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**is>> difficult to cure because we <<are always surrounded**T10**Absence_comp_sent**None**17**always surrounded>> <<by**T11**Prepositions**None**4**with>> all these technological things. What is more, if a person is always concentrated on <<the screen**T12**Articles**None**6**screen>> of his/her phone, <<the eyes**T13**Articles**None**4**eyes>> suffer, <<the eyesight**T14**Articles**None**8**eyesight>> becomes much weaker. There are millions  of people who <<wear**T15**Spelling**None**4**were>> glasses, especially office workers as they need to spend a lot of time in front of computers. Furthermore, social networks are one of the major part of <<our daily life**T16**Absence_explanation**None**10**daily life>>. People always <<surf in**T17**Prepositions**None**4**surf>> the Internet. There are always upcoming messages. For instance, signals from phone can distract from life and work very easily. People spend hours on them and then they are late with their projects and <<work tasks**T18**Absence_explanation**None**4**work>>. Thus, modern technologies can lead to stress and panic attacks. People become too nervous. 

There are some ways to anticipate these problems and mitigate the damaging effect of modern <<gadgets**T19**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>>. Firstly, people should spend less time on <<a comuter entertainment**T20**Articles**None**22**computer entertainment>> as this is just a waste of time which, unfortunately, can lead to unhealthy mind and body.

Secondly, it is crucial <<to take**T25**Prepositions**None**4**take>> some breaks during the work and do some <<exercises**T26**Spelling**None**9**exercizes>> to give some rest to <<the eyes**T40**Articles**None**3**eys>> and body #DELETE#8#at whole. This will also reduce the <<possibility**T30**lex_item_choice**None**8**evidence>> of gaining <<excessive**T32**Category_confusion**None**6**excess>> <<weight**T31**lex_item_choice**None**3**fat>>. Thirdly, the better way to <<minimize**T33**Spelling**None**8**minimaze>> the radiance level in oneâ€™s apartment is to decrease the number of <<gadgets**T34**Spelling**None**7**gadjetc>> in <<the house**T35**Articles**None**5**house>>.


To <<conclude**T36**Tense_choice**None**9**concluded>>, modern technologies are a very useful source <<in**T37**Prepositions**None**2**to>> society and world development but they can also cause some terrifying diseases.
