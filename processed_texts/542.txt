<<requirements**T379**Noun_number**None**1**ï»¿>>Recently, the <<cinematograph**T1**Spelling**None**13**cinamotograph>> <<has provided us with**T424**Prepositional_verb**None**15**has provided us>> a lot of new films <<of**T373**Prepositions**None**4**with>> different kinds of genre. Undoubtedly, <<the main part of this product is made by**T2**Absence_comp_sent**None**37**the main part of this product made by>> <<Britain**T426**Category_confusion**None**7**British>> and <<the United States**T428**Articles**None**13**United States>> of America. It goes without saying that it is <<popular enough**T375**Standard**None**14**enough popular>> <<among**T3**Spelling**None**6**amoung>> teenagers and adults #DELETE#6#people. I will try to explain why.
Firstly, t<<modern films**T432**Articles**None**16**the modern films>>f<<fit**T4**Agreement_errors**None**4**fits>>the r<<requirements**T380**Noun_number**None**11**requirement>>of population. People need more expression and bright emotions. Therefore, t<<cinema**T434**Articles**None**10**the cinema>>g<<gives**T5**Agreement_errors**None**4**give>>them such p<<products**T6**Noun_number**None**7**product>>as action movies, horrors and drama. Moreover, the ideas and conception a<<of**T436**Prepositions**None**5**about>>arts has changed. In modern world people have a<<aspirations**T438**Noun_number**None**13**an aspiration>>to self-develop and a lot of talent and creativity. So they make t<<masterpieces**T382**Articles**None**16**the masterpieces>>which o<<other**T384**Category_confusion**None**6**others>>people like because they also have this pursuit. Secondly, B<<Britain**T386**Category_confusion**None**7**British>>and U<<the USA**T388**Articles**None**3**USA>>have t<<a large money source**T390**Articles**None**22**the large money source>> Therefore, films of these countries s<<are significanty better**T392**Absence_comp_sent**None**20**significantly better>>than products of other countries. Such films as British and U<<American**T12**lex_item_choice**None**3**Usa>>films h<<are of**T394**Word_choice**None**4**have>>t<<great quality**T397**Articles**None**17**the great quality>> It c<<contains**T13**lex_item_choice**None**8**consists>>the grafics, actors, montage and etc. So it is the one of the important reason why many people t<<prefer**T398**Verbs**None**9**to prefer>>foreign films rather than locally produced films. In addition, t<<huge sums**T400**Articles**None**13**the huge sums>>of money s<<are being spent**T14**Tense_choice**None**5**spend>>on the design and m<<marketing**T15**Spelling**None**9**marceting>>in order to a<<attract people to**T402**Prepositional_verb**None**17**attract people in>>c<<the cinema**T404**Articles**None**6**cinema>> Therefore, people see the beautiful posters, buy the tickets and go to the cinema.
I strongly agree with the idea that governments sh<<should give**T406**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**should>>ore financial support to<<to their own**T408**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**to own>>ilms. However, in my opinion, this support should be strict, because a lot of un<<bad-quality**T8**Compound_word**None**9**unquality>>nd full films are displayed at the cinema, while the useful and qu<<high-quality**T410**Compound_word**None**7**quality>>ilms ha<<are**T9**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>>ot famous. I consider that is#DELETE#2# unfair. Actually, th<<cinematograph**T441**Articles**None**17**the cinematograph>>s th<<a part**T414**Articles**None**8**the part>>f national culture. Therefore, th<<cultural advancement**T443**Articles**None**23**the culture advancement>>eads to average well-being of population. Also film in<<industry**T416**Noun_number**None**10**industries>>as an influence on international re<<relationships**T445**Noun_number**None**12**relationship>>So I have the standpoint that go<<government**T7**Spelling**None**10**goverments>>hould pa<<give**T418**Word_choice**None**14**participate in>>inancial support to local film in<<industry**T420**Noun_number**None**10**industries>>
