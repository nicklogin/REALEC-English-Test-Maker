<<Nowadays**T1**Punctuation**None**9**Nowadays,>> we <<live**T2**Tense_choice**None**10**are living>> in <<an informational society**T3**Articles**None**21**informational society>><< which**T4**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> <<uses**T5**Tense_choice**None**9**are using>> gadgets <<all the time**T6**lex_item_choice**None**13**every minutes>>. That is already <<a known fact**T8**Absence_explanation**None**5**known>> that <<these**T9**Ref_device**None**4**this>> modern <<habbits**T10**lex_item_choice**None**7**changes>> <<influence**T12**Transitive**None**15**influentsing on>> our health.

In <<the twentieth century**T13**Articles**None**17**twentieth century>> people could not <<imagine**T16**Tense_choice**None**6**imaged>> that their <<grandchildren**T17**Noun_number**None**10**grandchild>> will live in so <<technically progressed**T89**Spelling**None**10**technicaly>> world like our. We have a lot of advantages and disadvantages of using <<modern technologies**T20**Spelling**None**21**a modern technologies>>. And one of those disadvantages <<are**T23**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> <<problems**T22**Noun_number**Dependent_change**7**problem>> with health. For instance, people who <<work**T24**Tense_choice**None**7**working>> in <<the design sphere**T25**Articles**None**13**design sphere>> should spent a lot of time with computers <<to create**T26**Prepositions**None**10**for create>> new products. They <<forget to**T28**Prepositions**None**6**forget>> have <<a meal**T29**Articles**None**4**meal>> very often, their eyes <<are damaged**T30**Voice**None**11**have damage>> <<because of**T31**Conjunctions**None**4**from>> <<computers' rays**T32**Possessive**None**14**computers rays>>. At the same time, <<technologies**T34**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> <<produce**T35**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> many problems on <<a road**T36**Articles**None**4**road>><< because**T37**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> many people use a <<phone**T38**lex_item_choice**None**9**telephone>> in <<the car**T89**Noun_number**None**4**cars>>. <<It**T41**Ref_device**None**4**That>> is very dangerous. 

Furthermore, <<technologies**T42**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> have <<many good aspects**T43**Articles**None**19**a many good aspects>> #DELETE#8#of using. For example, people with <<disabilities**T46**lex_item_choice**None**13**disadvantages>> can use the Internet for education. News are <<free**T47**lex_item_choice**None**4**open>> for <<everyone**T48**Often_confused**None**9**everybody>> and people can connect with different people in the world.

There <<are**T49**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> some ways <<to reduce**T50**Infinitive_constr**None**11**can reduced>> <<these**T51**Ref_device**None**5**those>> <<problems**T52**Noun_number**None**7**problem>>. Firstly, people should control <<the time**T53**Articles**None**4**time>><< when**T54**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> they are using <<gadgets**T55**Articles**None**9**a gadgets>>. They should <<take**T58**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> <<the right sitting position**T56**Articles**None**22**right sitting position>> <<in front of**T59**Prepositions**None**3**for>> computers<< which**T60**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> <<does not make**T61**Absence_explanation**None**8**does not>> <<any damage to**T89**Spelling**None**6**demage>> their back. Secondly, users of gadgets should <<do**T64**Tense_choice**None**5**doing>> some <<exercises**T65**Noun_number**None**8**exercise>> for eyes and #DELETE#12#keep fitting their body. <<If**T67**Conjunctions**None**4**When>> people <<do**T68**Tense_choice**None**5**doing>> sports exercises, they have less problems with health<< than**T69**Punctuation**None**6**, than>> people who <<do not**T70**lex_item_choice**None**8**have not>>. Besides, <<it**T72**Ref_device**None**4**that>> will be nice<< if**T73**Punctuation**None**4**, if>> <<people**T75**lex_item_choice**None**5**users>> <<wii have**T74**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**have>> a long-walk during the day. It is <<beneficial**T76**Spelling**None**9**benifical>> <<for**T77**Prepositions**None**4**with>> <<the neury system**T89**Spelling**None**16**the neuro system>> and <<it helps to relax**T80**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**relax>> #DELETE#10#their mind.

Overall, <<technologies**T82**Noun_number**Dependent_change**10**technology>> <<are**T83**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> great #DELETE#11#opportunity for humanity. Gadgets make us more clever and educated. We should have <<other**T85**Often_confused**None**7**another>> hobbies <<than**T86**lex_item_choice**None**5**exept>> social networks <<and**T87**Conjunctions**None**2**or>> surfing the Internet. People should begin using gadgets only for work, education and connection, not just for fun. Even if people <<ignore**T88**Conditionals**None**11**will ignore>> it, they will have a lot of problems with health and future <<generations**T89**Noun_number**None**10**generation>> will have more problems too.
