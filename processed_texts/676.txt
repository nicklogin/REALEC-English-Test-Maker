There are a lot of different opinions on the topic what goverment should do to reduce crimes. It is a big problem of current life. Humans <<can be**T373**Absence_explanation**None**3**are>> <<divided**T372**Spelling**None**7**devided>> into two groups: some people think that we should make <<prison sentences**T374**Articles**None**20**the prison sentences>> longer, others think that there are <<various ways**T376**Articles**None**14**a various ways>> to solve this problem.
First of all, I should try to explain why the first group h<<has**T378**Tense_form**None**4**have>>s<<such an opinion**T377**Articles**None**12**such opinion>> People believe that a long sentence in prison can be a good example for others. That other people think many times before d<<committing**T379**lex_item_choice**None**5**doing>>a crime. Nevertheless, they don't think about people who can get into the prison by mistake. Such humans have to stay in prison for all their l<<lives**T380**Spelling**None**5**lifes>>or for a<<quite a long**T381**Standard**None**12**a quite long>>sentence.
I jo<<join to**T382**Prepositional_verb**None**8**join for>>he second group of opinions. I believe that there are a lot of alternative ways to reduce a <<crime**T383**Articles**None**7**a crime>>At first, we should realise the real causes of a crime. We should learn, behave prisoners that prevent crimes. Moreover, in my opinion, making a <<prison sentences**T384**Articles**None**18**a prison sentences>>onger do<<will not solve**T385**Tense_choice**None**12**do not solve>>his problem. Many people know how it is bad to be in a prison, but they still do<<commit**T386**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>>o<<a crime**T387**Determiners**None**10**some crime>>We should try to do people's life better to reduce the crime. It may be better to mak<<make attention to**T388**lex_part_choice**None**17**make attention on>>haviour of people from the early age, from a school ot even kindergarden.
People should make<<make attention to**T389**lex_part_choice**None**21**make the attention on>> causes of the crime and try to solve the problems which push people to do s<<commit**T390**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>>e<<a crime**T391**Determiners**None**10**some crime>>y peopl<<do people, for instance, steal**T392**Tense_form**None**27**people, for instance, stole>> products or other things?

Of course, it is may be difficult to do, but we should try. I believe that giving longer prison sentences has n<<will not bring**T396**Absence_explanation**None**11**has not got>>o<<good results**T397**Articles**None**14**a good results>>conclude, I believe that people in near future can cr<<will be able to**T398**Modals**None**3**can>>e some new way to reduce crime.
