In the pie-charts that is given in the task we can see the statistics of transportation of the goods <<among**T5**Prepositions**None**7**between>> Eastern Europe's countries in 2008.
First d<<diagram**T2**Spelling**None**9**diagramme>>presents statistics of rail transportation. It shows that the most of all transported goods were metals, it is 35 p<<percent**T3**Noun_number**None**8**percents>>of all the goods. Manufactured goods took one quarter of the chart. Chemicals and food products took only 11% each and machinery took almost the same p<<share**T4**lex_item_choice**None**8**position>>- 12%. The least transported by rail goods were non-metallic minerals.
The second diagramme provides the information about goods transported by road. We can see there that food products took one third of all goods and manufactured goods took almost the same place of the chart. Chemicals, non-metallic minerals and metals were transported almost at the same level there is not more than 3% difference between them. And machinery barely transported by road as it took only 2% of the chart.
To summarise the given information it could be said that transportation of manufactured goods and chemicals were almost at the same level by road and by rail in 2008, while metals and machinery were transported mostly by rail. In case of machinary the percentage of transportation by rail is six times of road transportation percents. Food products were delivered mostly by road.
