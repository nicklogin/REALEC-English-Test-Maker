Nowadays, the question about influence of drugs on <<sportmen's**T6**Possessive**None**9**sportsmen>> <<lives**T5**Derivation**None**6**life's>> is <<often**T17**Suffix**None**7**oftenly>> <<discussed**T18**Voice**None**10**discussing>>. <<Such an opinion**T1**Articles**None**12**Such opinion>> that athletes who <<use**T2**Tense_choice**None**5**using>> illegal drugs should be banned from competing for some limited period exists. There is another <<opinion**T3**Word_choice**None**6**theory>> <<which suggests that**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**that>> such athletes should be <<banned from competing**T7**Absence_explanation**None**6**banned>> for the rest of their lives. It is <<really hard**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**really>> #DELETE#3#try to decide which opinion is more <<convincing**T10**Word_choice**None**8**powerful>>.
Some people believe that banning <<athletes**T11**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> from competing <<for life**T12**Word_choice**None**8**for ever>> is unfair. Person could have hard problems, also sportsmen are always in great emotional and nervous situations. So, if <<one**T14**lex_item_choice**None**5**human>> <<has**T15**Tense_form**None**4**have>> <<made a mistake**T16**lex_part_choice**None**14**done a mistake>> it should not cost a career for <<them**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**3**him>>. Moreover, after #DELETE#4#some medical and <<psycological**T19**Category_confusion**None**10**psychology>> treatment <<an athlete**T22**Articles**None**6**athlet>> can work and compete <<the same way as before**T23**Absence_explanation**None**15**in the same way>>.
However, others suppose that using illegal drugs in sport competitions is strictly not allowed. Athletes <<help themselves to be more strong and fast by using drugs**T27**Standard**None**57**by using drugs help themselves to be more strong and fast>> #DELETE#25#due to medical technology <<, and**T33**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<that**T34**Pronouns**None**2**it>> is unfair and <<unprofessional**T24**Category_confusion**None**16**unprofessionally>>. Besides, people using drugs usually become <<addicted**T29**Category_confusion**None**9**addictive>> and it is a medical problem <<that closes**T32**Defining**None**7**closing>> the way to professional <<sports**T21**Often_confused**None**5**sport>>. Also, sometimes using hard drugs causes traumas and illnesses which can even kill sportsmen.
In my personal <<opinion,**T37**Punctuation**None**7**opinion>> athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionally <<for life**T35**Word_choice**None**8**for ever>>, because it is dangerous for <<them**T36**suggestion**None**10**themselves>>. It is important to say that sport demonstrates human skills and abilities <<but**T39**Linking_device**None**3**and>> with <<drug use**T38**Category_confusion**None**11**using drugs>> it is just medical and pills competition, so sport just loses it's meaning. <<However**T40**Linking_device**None**8**Although>>, such hard questions should be <<discussed**T31**Spelling**None**8**discusse>> in <<a professional area**T41**Articles**None**17**professional area>> <<with the use of**T40**Category_confusion**None**5**using>> rules and justice.
