But manufactured goods have a higher <<percentage**T15**Often_confused**None**7**percent>> of <<goods transported**T16**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**transported>> by rail (25%) and by road (28%). <<In the road chart**T17**Prepositions**None**17**At the road chart>> machinery have the lowest <<percentage**T19**Often_confused**None**7**percent>> â€“ 2%.
