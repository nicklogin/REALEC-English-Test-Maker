The graphs <<provide the information about the differences**T3**Absence_explanation**None**23**provide the differences>> in maximum and minimum temperatures in Yakutsk, Russia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in average volumes. 

The main feature between these two graphs is <<the winters**T4**Articles**None**7**winters>> in two towns. <<They**T6**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**It>> <<depend**T7**Tense_form**Dependent_change**7**depends>> on location and different climates. As a result, there is a cold winter in Yakutsk with a hot summer, while in Rio winter is hot like a summer.  

The temperature in Yakutsk is <<minimal**T8**Word_choice**None**10**in minimum>> in January and December and stays <<at**T9**Prepositions**None**2**in>> -40*C <<at**T10**Prepositions**None**2**in>> minimum and <<at**T11**Prepositions**None**2**in>> -35*C <<at**T12**Prepositions**None**2**in>> maximum. Then, <<the temperature**T13**Articles**None**11**temperature>> <<grows**T14**Redundant**None**8**grows up>> and <<peaks**T15**Word_choice**None**10**get a peak>> in July, where <<the maximum**T16**Articles**None**7**maximum>> is about 25*C and <<the minimum**T17**Articles**None**7**minimum>> is about 17*C. <<After that,**T5**Punctuation**None**10**After that>> the values <<decrease**T18**lex_item_choice**None**7**decline>> and <<return**T19**Word_choice**None**9**come back>> to <<the year's**T45**Articles**None**6**year's>> minimums in December. 

<<On the other hand**T22**lex_part_choice**None**17**On the other side>>, <<the winter**T25**Articles**None**6**winter>> in Rio de Janeiro is <<hotter**T26**Comparative_adj**None**8**more hot>> than #DELETE#2#in <<the summer**T24**Articles**None**6**summer>>, but the difference is too small. <<It is**T29**Word_choice**None**9**There are>> 30*C <<at**T27**Prepositions**None**2**in>> maximum and 23*C <<at**T28**Prepositions**None**2**in>> minimum in January. January is <<the hottest**T30**Articles**None**7**hottest>> month in <<the year**T31**Articles**None**6**a year>>. And then, <<the temperature**T33**Articles**None**11**temperature>> <<decreases**T32**Tense_form**None**8**decrease>> to 25*C <<at**T38**Prepositions**None**2**in>> maximum and 12*C <<at**T39**Prepositions**None**2**in>> minimum to July, which is <<the coldest**T34**Articles**None**7**coldest>> month. But the values <<grow**T45**Tense_form**None**8**grows up>> <<in**T37**Prepositions**None**2**to>> December, where they are similar to January. <<The maximum temperature**T40**Articles**None**19**Maximum temperature>> <<there**T42**lex_item_choice**None**4**here>> is about 29*C and <<the minimum**T41**Determiners**None**7**minimum>> is about 22*C. 

Summarising the information, there is a <<huge**T43**Spelling**None**3**hug>> difference between Yakutsk, Russia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when #DELETE#10#completely <<for a half of the year**T48**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**half of the year>> <<the temperature**T47**Articles**None**11**temperature>> in Yakutsk is <<below**T44**lex_item_choice**None**5**under>> o*C, while the <<minimal**T45**Category_confusion**None**7**minimum>> temperature in Rio is 17*C.
