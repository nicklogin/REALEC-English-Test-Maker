The #DELETE#7#graphic <<pie charts**T2**Absence_explanation**Dependent_change**3**pie>> <<show**T3**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**shows>> <<the amount**T4**Articles**None**6**amount>> of some <<goods**T5**Noun_number**None**4**good>> which are moved by rail and by road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008.

As can we see, <<the proportion**T42**lex_item_choice**None**6**amount>> of <<metals**T8**Noun_number**None**5**metal>> take <<the biggest**T9**Superlative_adj**None**10**the bigger>> <<part of**T11**Prepositions**None**7**part at>> <<the chart**T10**Articles**None**7**a chart>>. But this high <<percentage**T12**lex_item_choice**None**7**percent>> of <<transported**T16**lex_item_choice**None**5**moved>> <<metals**T13**lex_item_choice**None**5**metal>> <<is**T14**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> actual only for <<the rail kind**T15**Articles**None**9**rail kind>> of transportation. On the one hand, we can say that <<metals**T17**Noun_number**Dependent_change**5**metal>> <<are**T18**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> more popular<< than**T19**Punctuation**None**6**, than>> other goods, but <<the second chart**T20**Articles**None**12**second chart>> <<illustrates**T21**Agreement_errors**None**10**illustrate>> that the amount of metals transported by road is extremely smaller than metals transported by rail and takes only 11% <<of all goods**T22**Prepositions**None**12**by all goods>> transported by road.

However, <<the percentage**T42**Articles**None**7**percent>> of manufactured goods transported by rail is similar to <<the percentage**T42**Often_confused**None**7**percent>> of manufactured goods transported by road. <<These**T27**Ref_device**None**4**This>> two kinds of <<goods**T28**Noun_number**None**4**good>> <<differ only by**T31**Prepositions**None**14**differ only in>> two <<per cent**T30**Noun_number**None**9**per cents>>.

<<Also,**T32**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> a big feature is  near food products, because <<the percentage**T42**Articles**None**7**percent>> of food transported by rail is smaller than <<the percentage**T42**Often_confused**None**8**percents>> of food transported by road.

Based on this information, we can make a conclusion that the most popular goods<< which are transported by rail**T37**Defining**None**31**, which are transported by rail>> <<are**T38**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> some manufactured goods and <<metals**T39**Noun_number**None**5**metal>>, and a car <<makes**T40**Agreement_errors**None**4**make>> <<the transportation**T41**Articles**None**14**transportation>> of food products even <<faster**T42**lex_item_choice**None**5**often>>.
