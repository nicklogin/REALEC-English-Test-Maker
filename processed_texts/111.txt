In modern reality, teenager became more and more criminalized. This is a very big problem for our society and many steps should be done to prevent young people from becoming criminals.
I am agree with the statemant 'we need to understand why is this happening and make something to change the situation. First of all, we all should agree that our century have many differences with oth other, but one of the most important ones is technology level. Today, a lot of young people play violent computer games, watch films about drugs and alchogol. This misslead teenagers and they do wrong things. To prevent it parents just need to spend more timy with their kids and, using the teacher' help, educate them what is good and what is bad. The second reason for this is that young people are still punished by their parents, and the modern life gives them more opportunity to make a crime (easier to find a gun, less risk of being killed). The edvice for parents is the same - they need  to think carefully about their children.
On the other hand, the modern society gives to teenagers more opportunities to educate themselfes. This should not lead to any bad concequances, how many says. They argue that technology make life easier. Also, they think that modern opportunity, which many countries give, such that hot water, heaters, electricity should make everyone, including parents, feel free to live their lifes and have less stress, so do less crimes or make bad thing for kids (to make them do crime).
To some it up, we live in the world with great opportunities. Technology gives us many good thing, but harm us as well. and tho prevent people, who are under the biggest risk of this harn (all young people), to do crimes educating them, making them happy everyday in their life.
