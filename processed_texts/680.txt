The recent years, due to the cause of the total progress, the development countries have less crime. At the same time, the disappearing of this phenomen is only the ullusion. And the question is "What we need to change?". Some people belive that the best way to stop crime is to make prison sentences longer. Others claim that the high purity of life can prove only the humanity method.
The fist "camp" confident in the right position of making punishment longer isntead of letting prisoners be a part of society. The frenetic pace of increasing crime cannot stop the small period of sentence. The world need to rethink and understand that the main way to end with dreadful crimes are making people to fright by using hard methods.
Another "camp" claim that all people have a chance to change. Mostly the prisoners made awfull actions due to the fact of the social problems. All people has light beginning inside the soul. The alternative ways(by using education, social works etc.) are the right choice to make our world better.
To my point of view, I understand that the fast way of progress, wich make the differences between poor and rich people are highest, wil be continuing to increase the crime. However, the right position is to change prisoner's mind instead of the time's period of his sentence.
To the end, it should be mentioned that the best idea of stopping crime is trying to give a comprehensive deveplopment of personality frome childhood. It's really important to prove the glory of life by giving an opportunity to be a part of society to every person. That's why to achive the worldwide purity we need to develope the best character traits by using immortal values of life.
