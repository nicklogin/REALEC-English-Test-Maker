Today we live in an open world. Almost all information is open and available in the Internet. Due to this <<openness**T1**Spelling**None**7**openess>> people <<are**T2**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> highly affected by popular trends and people in Internet. <<In my opinion,**T3**Punctuation**None**13**In my opinion>> exactly this usually harmful effect can be a cause of “young crimes”.
Of course, <<the Internet**T45**Articles**None**8**internet>> is one of the greatest <<tools**T6**Agreement_errors**None**4**tool>> for making a business, providing any reseach, or even just for fan and relax. Unfortunately, it has also much <<content that looks crazy and harmful to educated people**T47**Absence_explanation**None**42**harmful, crazy for educated people content>>. For example, I <<saw**T9**Tense_choice**None**9**have seen>> <<a group**T8**Articles**None**9**the group>> in <<a popular social network**T10**Articles**None**22**popular social network>>, VK, it was something like <<a private club**T12**Articles**None**12**private club>> for young people. If you wanted to enter this <<club,**T17**Punctuation**None**4**club>> you #DELETE#5#would <<had to**T15**lex_item_choice**None**9**should to>> record a video with your falling on behind a car on a <<road**T16**Spelling**None**5**roade>>. This is absolutely unacceptable. Young people are easily affected by others, even if it #DELETE#1#a dangerous#DELETE#1#, and can be cause of <<some crimes to be committed**T23**Absence_explanation**None**11**some crimes>>.
To prevent this trend, young people should be <<barred**T24**Spelling**None**7**barried>> from this content by their parents. There are two ways. The first one is strict, parents can download a program on children devices. It will block <<certain**T25**lex_item_choice**None**4**some>> <<sites**T26**Noun_number**None**4**site>>. This way may <<lead to**T28**lex_item_choice**None**6**create>> some <<difficulties**T27**Spelling**None**11**dificulties>> in family relationships. The second one is <<better,**T29**Punctuation**None**6**better>> but much more difficult. <<Parents**T30**Noun_number**None**8**Parent’s>> can <<explain to**T31**Prepositional_verb**Dependent_change**7**explain>> their children #DELETE#5#about all <<consequences of**T33**Prepositional_noun**None**17**consequences from>> <<the harmful trend**T34**Articles**None**13**harmful trend>>.
To summarize, the most likely cause of <<the trend**T35**Articles**None**5**trend>>#DELETE#1#, <<towards young people's committing more crimes than ever before**T37**Linking_device**None**56**that young people committed more crimes than ever before>> is #DELETE#2#an <<the amount of crazy and harmful content in the Internet**T39**Absence_comp_sent**None**34**Internet crazy and harmful content>>. The best way to <<solve this problem for parents**T44**Absence_explanation**Dependent_change**18**solve this problem>> <<is to provide an explanation**T42**Absence_explanation**None**17**is an explanation>><<explanation of**T46**Prepositional_noun**None**17**explanation about>> <<all the**T43**Often_confused**None**5**every>> dangerous consequences of following <<harmful**T41**Spelling**None**8**harmfull>> trends #DELETE#12#from parents to their children.
