There is an opinion that nowadays people <<tend to**T43**Voice**None**10**are tended>> <<to have**T42**Infinitive_constr**None**6**to has>> many <<health**T2**Spelling**None**5**heath>> problems due to the development of modern <<technology**T3**Spelling**None**9**tecnology>>. This essay will <<discuss**T12**lex_item_choice**None**5**argue>> the causes of diseases and analyze problems #DELETE#13#and solutions of the widespread use of computers and their harmful influence.
There are tough challenges associated with this issue and <<their**T44**Ref_device**None**3**its>> effects have very serious consequences. <<people**T45**Word_choice**None**6**Public>> generally tend to believe that computers and <<sedentary**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**sitting>> lifestyle cause <<problems with health**T5**Articles**None**17**a health problems>>, such as: <<poor eyesight**T27**Word_choice**None**30**a decreasing quality of seeing>>, <<eye diseases**T28**Word_choice**None**16**diseases of eyes>>. <<However,**T6**Punctuation**None**7**However>> modern medicine is developing <<, too,**T26**Punctuation**None**3**too>> and <<you can**T32**Word_choice**None**22**there is no problem to>> improve your eyes <<by**T47**Prepositions**None**3**nor>> doing <<exercises for eyes**T35**Word_choice**None**14**eyes-exercises>> <<or**T36**Linking_device**None**6**either>> <<by undergoing**T29**Word_choice**None**12**doing making>> <<eye surgery**T30**Word_choice**None**17**medical operation>>. One cannot <<deny**T7**Voice**None**7**be deny>> that the <<faster**T9**Word_choice**None**7**quicker>> <<IT sector**T33**Spelling**None**9**IT-sector>> <<dvelops**T34**Word_choice**None**8**improves>>, the <<better**T8**Spelling**None**6**b tter>> medicine becomes #DELETE#5#to be. Progress is <<achieved**T62**Tense_choice**None**6**coming>> in all <<spheres**T10**Spelling**None**8**spheares>>.
<<Other**T49**Determiners**Dependent_change**8**One more>> <<problems**T37**Noun_number**Dependent_change**7**problem>> <<that**T11**Spelling**None**4**than>> can be mentioned <<are**T38**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> <<heart attacks**T39**Spelling**None**13**heart-attacks>> and obesity. Nowadays there is a trend, for instance, to work in front of the monitors, <<and occasionally**T62**Conjunctions**None**11**ocasionally>> people have a freelance job, they prefer to work at home. One of the most striking <<problems**T16**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> #DELETE#2#it is <<the deficit**T62**Articles**None**8**deficite>> of <<activity**T41**Category_confusion**None**7**actions>>. It leads to obesity, bad mood, <<inactive**T51**Prefix**None**10**non-active>> and <<unenthusiastic**T52**Prefix**None**16**not enthusiastic>> lifestyle. This problem <<cannot**T53**Modals**None**7**can not>> be solved <<entirely**T40**Word_choice**None**12**in the whole>> because of developing demand <<on**T54**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the labour market of IT, advertising, PR and different <<sedentary**T55**Word_choice**None**10**non-active>> but extremely important jobs. Moreover, <<there**T19**Capitalisation**None**5**There>> is no way to overcome Internet-addiction <<completely**T20**Word_choice**None**10**absolutely>>, but scientists <<predict**T56**Word_choice**None**7**suggest>> that new <<generations**T57**Noun_number**None**10**generation>> will not be <<as**T21**Comparative_constr**None**8**the same>> addicted as <<today's**T58**Word_choice**None**6**modern>> generation because there is <<new understanding**T22**Articles**None**33**a new knowledge and understanding>> that sitting in front of the monitors is a waste of time.
From these facts one may conclude that <<despite**T23**Prepositions**None**10**despite of>> the fact that modern technology is causing an increasing number of <<health**T24**Spelling**None**5**heath>> problems, there are new ways to improve <<medical care**T62**Articles**None**12**the medicine>> and to provide <<new ways**T62**Noun_number**None**10**a new form>> of saving our lives. To sum it up, mankind should understand - there is no progress without mistakes and <<problems**T62**Word_choice**None**8**troubles>>.
