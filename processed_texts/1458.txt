Copying, sharing and downloading pirate copies of films or music is a controversial issue nowadays<<.**T1**Spelling**None**1**,>> It is <<a theft**T2**Articles**None**5**theft>> and people who do that should be punished because of musicians and film producers <<, who lose great amounts of money every year**T3**Non_defining**None**42**who lose great amounts of money every year>>. I am completely <<sure**T4**lex_item_choice**None**5**agree>> that people who download such files should be punished, but there are some advantages and disadvantages of this situation which I will discuss in this essay. 

<<On the one hand,**T5**Prepositions**None**16**For the one hand>>, pirate copies allow poor people <<, who have no opportunity to buy original discs,**T6**Non_defining**None**45**who have no opportunity to buy original discs>> to download and to enjoy music or films. For some people it is the only chance to know cinema trends and popular musicians. They have <<no way out of**T8**Prepositions**None**13**no way out in>> that situation and no possible <<solution**T9**Noun_number**None**9**solutions>>. 

<<On the other hand,**T10**Prepositions**None**18**For the other hand>>, it is a complete <<violation**T12**lex_item_choice**None**5**break>> of <<the author's rights**T13**Articles**None**15**authorâ€™s rights>>. In this case such theft should be punished by <<a tax**T14**Articles**None**3**tax>>. <<Furthermore**T15**Spelling**None**10**Futhermore>>, there is another <<problem with**T16**Prepositions**None**10**problem of>> pirate copies. People who download copies <<risk**T17**Tense_choice**None**11**are risking>> to catch a virus on their computer or tablet. It is definitely a big problem and <<the reason**T18**Articles**None**8**a reason>> why pirate copies should be prohibited. One more disadvantage of sharing pirate <<copies**T20**Noun_number**None**4**copy>> is losing money by producers and creators of music or films. 

There are advantages and disadvantages of using pirate copies. Moreover, it is a theft, but it seems to me that it should be punished by <<a tax**T21**Articles**None**3**tax>> instead of <<a strong punishment**T22**Articles**None**17**strong punishment>>. <<Also,**T23**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> musicians and film producers can create mote copies of their discs, for example, and try to solve <<them**T24**Ref_device**None**2**it>> with the lowest price. It can be one of <<possible solutions**T26**Articles**None**22**the possible solutions>> in <<this**T27**Ref_device**None**4**that>> situation.
