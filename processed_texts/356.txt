It is no doubt that nowadays, <<according**T1**Spelling**None**9**accoridng>> to the <<statisctics**T2**Countable_uncountable**None**9**statistic>>, the <<greatest**T41**lex_item_choice**None**4**most>> number of all crimes <<are committed**T4**Tense_form**None**18**are been committed>> by teenagers. Moreover, this number <<is gradually increasing**T6**Tense_choice**None**19**increases gradually>>, unfortunatelly. In this essay I <<am going to try**T7**Tense_choice**None**3**try>> to provide some possible causes of this fact and give some solutions to prevent it in <<the future**T8**Articles**None**6**future>>.
It is clear from criminal statistics that in most cases of crime, t<<young people**T9**Articles**None**16**the young people>>participate in it and there are some causes o<<of**T10**Prepositions**None**2**on>>it.Some of them grow up in a poor family and they want to get a<<some money**T11**Determiners**None**7**a money>> Also, one of the causes may be the environment, where t<<these**T12**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>>people g<<have grown up**T13**Tense_choice**None**7**grew up>> Some scientists c<<claim**T14**Agreement_errors**None**6**claims>>that it is the m<<likeliest**T16**lex_item_choice**None**13**most possible>>c<<cause**T15**Noun_number**None**6**causes>>For example, w<<when**T20**Spelling**None**4**wnen>>one of t<<the**T17**Spelling**None**3**tne>>m<<members**T18**Noun_number**None**6**member>>of f<<the family**T19**Articles**None**6**family>>was in prisoner.Another assumption is that the desire to crime is innate and it is in their n<<nature**T21**Spelling**None**7**nurture>>
I can provide some solution, which will be helpful for prevent it. For instance, th<<young people**T22**Articles**None**16**the young people>>hould have more sport sections.It may be interesting, therefore there are a <<different opportunities**T23**Articles**None**26**a different opportuinities>>or competition. Such team sports like football, ba<<basketball**T24**Spelling**None**10**basletball>>nd etc. Moreover, parents and teachers should pa<<pay more attention to**T25**lex_part_choice**None**22**pay more attention for>>eenagers and control them in a good sence. They can su<<suggest their children and students**T26**Dative**None**39**suggest to their children and studients>>ead more books.
In my view,the<<young people**T27**Articles**None**16**the young people>>oud recognise with help of their parents, teachers, books or other resources that do <<committing**T35**Category_confusion**None**2**do>>i<<a crime**T30**Articles**None**5**crime>> not good for the<<the criminals themselves**T35**Ref_device**None**10**themselves>>d for soc<<the society**T33**Articles**None**7**society>> general. The<<Teenagers**T34**Articles**None**13**The teenagers>>ould hav<<be charged with things to do**T39**Absence_explanation**None**17**have be more busy>> his<<their**T40**Pronouns**None**3**his>>fe and in this cas<<case**T38**Noun_number**None**5**cases>> <<there will be no place for thoughts about crimes in their minds.**T37**Absence_comp_sent**None**53**in they mind won't be thoughts, connected with crimes>>
