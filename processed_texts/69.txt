The topic of illegal copying of films and music <<has lately become**T3**Tense_choice**None**13**lately became>> very debatable <<, and**T2**Punctuation**None**3**and>> lots of controvercial points of view are mentioned. Some people think<< that**T4**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> producers, lose their #DELETE#4#fair money, that is why <<people who copy the media content**T7**Defining**None**35**people, who copy the media content,>> must be punished. Others believe that <<it is**T10**lex_item_choice**None**8**there is>> not <<a point**T11**Articles**None**9**the point>>.
<<Supporters**T12**Articles**None**14**The supporters>> of <<the first position**T14**Articles**None**14**first position>> usually <<draw**T15**lex_item_choice**None**5**gives>> <<a parallel**T16**lex_item_choice**None**25**an examples of comparison>> between thieves, who can steel films and break the law as well. Why do we punish the first group of people and ignore <<the**T17**Capitalisation**None**3**The>> second one? These #DELETE#9#number of people believe that it could lead to a “death” of <<cinemas**T20**Noun_number**None**6**cinema>> as a way of spending your <<free time**T19**Spelling**None**8**freetime>> and <<meeting your friends**T21**Transitive**None**25**meeting with your friends>>, because you can stay at home and watch a <<movie**T22**Spelling**None**6**moovie>>.
The critics of punishment speak about the <<irrationality**T23**lex_item_choice**None**10**disability>> of <<comparing**T24**Category_confusion**None**10**comparison>> <<crimes**T25**Noun_number**None**9**the crime>> like <<stealing**T26**Spelling**None**8**steeling>> something and pirate copying: the rate is the same. Moreover, it is very hard to <<find**T28**lex_item_choice**None**5**bring>> <<any**T29**Often_confused**None**4**some>> evidence and <<arrest**T30**lex_item_choice**None**4**find>> a criminal, so it will only lead to <<overburdening**T27**lex_item_choice**None**17**overdealing among>> policemen. Well, <<to point out my own position,**T31**Punctuation**None**28**to point out my own position>> I can say that nowadays the industry of cinema and music is transitioned into the internet area <<, so it**T32**Conjunctions**None**2**it>> is really convenient to stay at home and listen to music, for instance. All in all, despite <<the fact that**T45**Conjunctions**None**8**the fact>> <<pirates**T35**Spelling**None**6**pirats>> break the rules and need to pay <<fees**T36**lex_item_choice**None**10**some money>> for it, <<they should not**T37**lex_item_choice**None**3**but>> not be taken <<to**T38**Prepositions**None**4**into>> prison.
In conclusion, we need to claim that government should think about the ways of making it easier for people to post music and films <<on**T39**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the internet, as this industry is developing <<nowadays**T40**lex_item_choice**None**9**everydays>>. Legal ways sometimes are too costly , that is why <<everything**T41**lex_item_choice**None**3**all>> <<is done**T42**Voice**None**4**done>> illegaly. <<It doesn't matter**T43**lex_item_choice**None**9**No matter>> if these changes <<are made**T47**Tense_choice**None**12**will be made>> or not, <<there still are**T46**Absence_explanation**None**9**there are>> <<different**T45**Spelling**None**8**differnt>> points of view on this issue.
