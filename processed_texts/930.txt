<<The piecharts**T1**Articles**None**9**Piecharts>> illustrate information about goods transported by rail and by road in percentage. Each pie chart shows <<its own**T2**Determiners**None**3**own>> information with differencies in percentage of each <<type of goods**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**goods.>>
