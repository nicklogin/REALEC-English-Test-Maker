Today the medicine is very development and some goods and achivment are using in sports for unfair purposes. In last years we became witness of several scandals connected to using illegal drugs by athletes. In this essay we will compare two different opinions about punishment for those athletes.
On the right hand, everyone can make mistake and choose incorrected way. The ban for several years it's a good lesson and leave a chance for sportsmens to start a new life without mistakes from past. It's important because sometimes using illegal drugs is not own athlete's decision. In history was times when sportsmen was pressed by his trainers. They makes this athletes to choose drugs. On the other hand the ban from sports for the rest of sportsmen's lifes is a justice decision because using drugs can change their bodies forever. and sportsmens never able to ready for fair competitions. For example some medicenes leave organizm a very long time. And another important cause is that once unfair person stole the prize and now we haven't evidences that he will not try to do this again.
In my opinion we should decide depended on situation. Every situation must be discussed personally.
