Many people like to watch British or American films more than films produced in other locations. I think that these films are truly the best <<for**T11**lex_item_choice**None**10**because of>> the following reasons.
To begin with, U<<the UK**T1**Articles**None**2**UK>>and U<<the USA**T2**Articles**None**3**USA>>are very rich and d<<highly developed**T12**Absence_comp_colloc**None**9**developed>>c<<countries**T3**Noun_number**None**7**country>>and they can spend enough money to make a good a#DELETE#13#nd realistic film. Then they know what people need because they feel the mood of our society. There are a lot of fashion clothes there and girls from all the world may look like their favorite characters. Nevertheless, I am sure that the main reason is the fact that t<<most countries**T4**Redundant**None**21**the most of countries>>are o<<oriented at**T14**Prepositional_noun**None**11**oriented on>>American culture and some people want to look like A<<Americans or the British do**T15**Absence_comp_colloc**None**24**Americans or the British>>

It is a difficult question if governments should give more money to su<<cinematograghic**T6**Ref_device**None**4**such>>irms. On the one hand, the level of American and British films is rather high and it would be difficult to do something better or at least th<<at the same level**T17**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**the same>>However, on the other hand, it can be something new and may give new directions to the cinema. Although I think that the American and British ci<<films**T7**lex_item_choice**None**6**cinema>>re the best, I am sure that local industries can show something significant and people will like these films.
To sum it up, some people reckon that American and British films are the best nowadays but it would be interesting if governments pro<<provided**T8**Tense_choice**None**7**provide>>re financial support to local film industries.
