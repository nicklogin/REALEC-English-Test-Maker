There are several reasons <<for**T8**Prepositions**None**2**of>> <<that**T9**Ref_device**None**4**this>> problem, and <<some**T10**lex_item_choice**None**7**various>> measures can be taken by <<the governmnet**T11**Articles**None**11**governement>> and <<the department of health state**T12**Word_order**None**23**state health department>> to improve <<this**T13**Ref_device**None**3**the>> situation.
