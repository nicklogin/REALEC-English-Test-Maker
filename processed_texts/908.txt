Both charts represent the information about goods which <<were**T15**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> transported <<in**T1**Prepositions**None**2**by>> various ways: by rail and by road in <<the Eastern Europe**T2**Articles**None**14**Eastern Europe>> in 2008.
As can be seen from the first chart, the lowest percentage of goods transported by rail belongs to non-metallic minerals. Then 11% are chemicals and also 11% are food products. <<In this way of transportation machinery takes 12%**T3**Standard**None**49**Machinery in this way of transportation takes 12%>> and manufactured goods take 1/4 part of all goods. The highest <<proportion**T4**lex_item_choice**None**5**range>> belongs to metals and it <<reaches**T5**Tense_choice**None**7**reached>> a <<percentage number**T6**lex_item_choice**None**6**number>> of 35% <<out of all goods**T16**lex_part_choice**None**14**from all goods>>.
Another situation can be seen <<in**T18**Prepositions**None**4**from>> the second chart <<, that show the information about the goods transported by road**T12**Non_defining**None**48**that informs about the goods transported by road>>. The lowest <<proportion**T8**lex_item_choice**None**4**rate>> of such goods belongs to machinery and it is valued about 2%. The metals which took the first place in <<the previous chart**T10**Articles**None**14**previous chart>> <<take**T11**Tense_form**None**5**takes>> only <<the 5th in this one**T13**Absence_explanation**None**7**the 5th>> with 11%. Non-metallic minerals and chemicals are transported with the <<percentage numbers**T19**lex_item_choice**None**10**percentage>> of 13 and 16. And almost the same rates belong to <<the manufactured goods and food**T27**Articles**None**27**manufactured goods and food>>: 28% and 30%.
Overall, the similar amount of goods transported <<in**T23**Prepositions**None**2**by>> two different ways belongs to <<the manufactured goods**T24**Articles**None**18**manufactured goods>>: 25% and 28%, while in <<the other spheres**T25**Articles**None**13**other spheres>> these percentages <<change depending on**T27**Verb_Gerund**None**18**change depended on>> transportation way.
