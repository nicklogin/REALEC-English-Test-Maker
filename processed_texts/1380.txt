Modern world has <<a really big problem**T1**Articles**None**18**really big problem>>, on the one hand, with <<the health**T2**Articles**None**6**health>> of <<humanity**T3**Spelling**None**9**humanices>>, but at the same time, <<it has**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**has>> <<an active development**T5**Articles**None**18**active development>> of <<technologies**T7**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> which <<are made**T9**lex_item_choice**None**3**try>> to reduce our problems <<quickly**T8**Spelling**None**6**quicly>>.

Clearly, #DELETE#4#that nowadays <<we**T11**lex_item_choice**None**5**human>> <<cannot**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> imagine our life without modern <<technologies**T13**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>. So, some people have big problem with health, because they <<do not**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> know how to <<live**T15**lex_item_choice**None**15**right connected>> with <<technologies**T16**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>. In my opinion, people should control <<the amount of time**T17**Articles**None**14**amount of time>> which they spend with <<technologies**T18**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>, because, for example, <<many of**T19**lex_item_choice**None**4**more>> my friends have problems with eyes. And all of them <<have**T20**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> glasses, because <<they cannot live**T22**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**cannot live>> with modern <<technologies**T23**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>, with phones, computers etc. I think<< that**T24**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> if they had spent their time <<in the nature**T25**Prepositions**None**13**on the nature>> or with <<real**T26**Category_confusion**None**6**really>> books, not <<computers**T27**Noun_number**None**8**computer>>, they would have had <<a better health**T28**Articles**None**13**better health>>.

First of all, people should create <<a plan**T29**Articles**None**4**plan>> or limists for <<the use of technology**T30**Absence_explanation**None**10**technology>> and after that they can use <<them**T31**Ref_device**None**3**tat>> or <<technologies**T32**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> <<will be**T33**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**will>> dangerous for them, on the one hand. So, I think that technology is a good way to do something important for our work, for our <<development**T34**Category_confusion**None**7**develop>> and <<knowledges**T35**Noun_number**None**9**knowledge>> about the world.
