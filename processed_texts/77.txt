A lot of artists and <<entertaining**T1**Category_confusion**None**13**entertainment>> organisations have <<financial**T2**Spelling**None**11**financional>> <<losses**T3**lex_item_choice**None**5**costs>> because of free using of their <<products**T4**lex_item_choice**None**8**contents>> <<on**T5**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet. Many Internet users prefer to have <<free access**T6**Articles**None**13**a free access>> to mediafiles. Today it shapes the agenda in governmental structures <<, and**T7**Punctuation**None**3**and>> politicians and lawers discuss <<a debatable issue**T9**Articles**None**15**debatable issue>> about some restrictions and punishments for illegal users of media-products on the web-resources.
<<Protection**T11**Articles**None**14**The protection>> of intellectual property is an ambitious aim of post modern <<world**T10**lex_item_choice**None**5**state>>. Because of increasing amounts of new technologies pirates have broad opportunities to <<distribute**T13**lex_item_choice**None**5**share>> official production <<with**T12**Prepositions**None**2**by>> free pirate copies on the Internet. Few years ago it was harder to find pirates and users of their illegal production. However, today the protection of intellectual rights is connected with access to IP-addresses of users. Producers of copies are banned by <<Internet providers**T27**Spelling**None**18**Internet-providers>> in many countries. However, <<methods**T15**Articles**None**11**the methods>> of restriction of <<users' activities**T14**Punctuation**None**16**users activities>> undermine their freedom of access to information. Some people are punished <<, because**T16**Punctuation**None**7**because>> they <<know**T17**lex_item_choice**None**7**realize>> their rights connected with basic freedoms. So, <<types of punishment**T18**lex_item_choice**None**15**the punishments>> that protect intellectual rights stay against the basic right of free access to information. Furthermore, producers of pirate copies should be found and identified, because they provide <<risks of**T19**Prepositional_noun**None**5**risks>> either intellectual property of <<official**T20**Spelling**None**7**oficial>> <<media companies**T26**Spelling**None**15**media-companies>> and artists, or Internet users, who use free information because of their basic <<rights**T21**Noun_number**None**5**right>>. These pirates undermine financial balance of intellectual right’s owners. Moreover, <<users**T22**Articles**None**9**the users>> of copies, who share pirate information and not only use it, become pirates themselves. However, simple users of downloaded copyfiles should have undermined access to information on the Internet. Laws and provided punishments should be used by officials against producers of pirate files.
Inspite of <<financial losses**T24**lex_item_choice**None**4**cost>> of official producers of <<media content**T25**Spelling**None**13**media-content>>, the government can <<impose**T23**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> restrictions only on products of pirate information and not on users. In addition, <<the government**T28**Articles**None**10**government>> <<may be able**T29**Modals**None**7**is able>> to find punishments and methods of pirate’s identification in the future.
