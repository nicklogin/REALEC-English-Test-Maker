Nowadays people are getting more and more concerned about their free time. An infinite varity of people prefer watching sport when they have time on their hands. And I can see this point of view. However, some people argue that this is a useless activity. In this essay I am going to discuss both sides, express my opinion and provide some examples.
I can surely say that sport is one of the best and important things in our life. Fisrtly, we can watch sports on TV and in real live as a kind of our hobby. It should be said that hobby is essential because it can broaden our mind and help to escape from reality. Secondly, watching sports can rally people because of the same feelings and emotions. Thirdly, it is very wonderful to have an opportunity to watch sport with your friends and just relax. As for me I am really happy when my family and I visit sport events or sit together on weekends, watch sports on TV and comment the game like we are great commentators like Vasiliy Utkin.
However, some people think differently. They claim that watching sports is just a waste of time. It should be noticed that loving sport can be possible only after watching it at least once. I have friends that do not like sport events. But when it comes to the qusetion "Why", they can not answer. And the reason is that they have never tried to take up this kind of hobby. Watching sports have something common with reading books. You should only set the wheels in motion and start, and then you will be not able to stop doing it. In conclusion, I would like to underline that every person has his or her own interests and opinion. And it is normal when one of two friends like sport, while the other friens can not stand it. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that watching sport as well as doing sport always was and is a great activity.
