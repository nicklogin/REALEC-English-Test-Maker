The pie chart depicts how different goods were transported in different ways in Eastern Europe in 2008: by rail and by road.
First of all, it is hard not to mention that the most popular p<<products**T1**Spelling**None**7**poducts>>that "travelled" by rail were metals. However, it seems that it was not very useful to delliver them by road. We can see that usually companies choose this way of transportation for food products.
