There is a popular opinion<< that**T2**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> violating <<copyright laws**T53**Articles**None**13**the copyright>> is a robbery, so <<people**T5**Articles**None**10**the people>> who use <<pirate software**T6**Articles**None**19**the pirate software>> and digital content are criminals, <<and**T54**Linking_device**None**2**so>> their actions should be prevented and <<persecuted**T7**lex_item_choice**None**8**punished>> properly. There is also an opposite opinion, which says that <<things**T8**Articles**None**10**the things>> have changed in digital era, so copyright legislation should be reformed nowadays.
<<I am inclined**T55**Word_choice**None**12**It is likely>> to say<< that**T9**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<the second**T56**Articles**None**6**second>> opinion has more convincing arguments that prove its relevance. First of all, there is a big difference between using pirate content <<for commercial and non-commercial purposes**T57**lex_part_choice**None**37**in commercial and non-commercial aims>>#DELETE#26#, that should be mentioned. In <<the former**T59**Ref_device**None**5**first>> case, making money from <<a piece of art**T10**Articles**None**16**the piece of art>><< which doesn’t belong to one**T11**Punctuation**None**30**, which doesn’t belong to one,>> is literally a crime and should never be <<justified**T15**lex_item_choice**None**8**allowed,>> <<just like**T12**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**like>> other cases of <<theft**T13**Noun_number**None**6**thefts>>. In <<the latter**T53**Articles**None**6**second>> case, <<a consumer**T16**Articles**None**8**consumer>> doesn’t get any commercial profit from using the pirate content, so it <<cannot**T18**Tense_choice**None**9**could not>> be called a <<crime**T19**Category_confusion**None**11**criminality>>, because the aim of such use is not <<violating**T20**Category_confusion**None**14**a violating of>> property rights, but just #DELETE#6#baring <<enjoying**T17**Lack_par_constr**None**14**enjoyment from>> <<a piece of art**T21**Articles**None**16**the piece of art>>.
The second argument is #DELETE#9#the case, that fighting for <<copyright laws**T25**Absence_explanation**None**9**copyright>> is not <<effective**T23**lex_item_choice**None**10**productive>> for modern artists. Nowadays, it is very hard and expensive to delete the information from the Internet every time it <<appears there**T26**Absence_explanation**None**7**appears>>. <<The amount**T61**Articles**None**11**This amount>> of <<resources required**T27**Absence_explanation**None**9**resources>> will not be covered by the profit from content <<every time a pirate copy is deleted**T28**Absence_explanation**None**10**every time>>. Modern digital technologies provide <<so many**T29**lex_item_choice**None**4**such>> sources of gaining profit, <<such as**T30**Absence_comp_colloc**None**2**as>> crowd-funding platforms, receiving donations from <<fans**T31**Articles**None**8**the fans>> or just promoting one’s own concerts, exhibitions or performances, which <<can well be**T62**Absence_explanation**None**8**could be>> monetized #DELETE#6#either.
The point of people, <<who**T33**Defining**None**3**who>> defend <<copyright laws**T53**Articles**None**13**the copyright>> is that <<artists**T36**Articles**None**11**the artists>> actually suffer from <<not getting**T37**Word_choice**None**10**misgetting>> <<profit**T38**Articles**None**10**the profit>> from their art, and this doesn’t <<let them achieve**T41**Verb_object_bare**None**19**let them to achieve>> appropriate life standarts. <<On the contrary**T42**Linking_device**None**15**In opposite way>>, it could be mentioned<< that**T43**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> the most profitable content is not independent, it is a part of record labels, producer <<centers**T44**Spelling**None**8**center’s>> <<, etc.**T46**Punctuation**None**5**etc.,>> which take the biggest part of gained profit #DELETE#13#to themselves, while <<an artist**T45**Articles**None**6**artist>> takes the least slice, so modern system of copyright is bad for creators, but good for those who don’t create content#DELETE#1#, but only <<spread**T49**lex_item_choice**None**10**widespread>> it.
In conclusion, #DELETE#21#it could be said that the system of copyright is rather <<outdated**T50**lex_item_choice**None**4**old,>> and doesn’t respond to <<requirements**T51**Noun_number**None**11**requirement>> of digital art, it is not fair and it could be reformed in certain ways, because <<modern technologies**T52**Articles**None**23**the modern technologies>> can provide different forms of making <<art**T53**Articles**None**6**an art>> profitable.
