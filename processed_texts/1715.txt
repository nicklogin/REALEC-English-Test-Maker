The pie charts <<present**T2**Prefix**None**10**represents>> the information about <<international**T25**Word_choice**None**6**world->><<trade**T5**lex_item_choice**None**6**market>> between European countries and <<ways**T6**lex_item_choice**None**5**kinds>> of transporting goods. Overall, rail transportation is more appropriate for metals <<, whereas**T7**Punctuation**None**7**whereas>> food products are commonly transported by road.
It can be seen from the graph that <<a quarter**T8**lex_item_choice**None**8**fourfold>> of all transported goods by both rail and road <<were**T9**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> manufactured goods. The percentage of <<transported chemicals**T27**Word_choice**None**25**chemicals' transportation>> is approximately the same - 11 per cent of all goods transported by rail and 16 per cent <<of those carried by road**T10**Absence_explanation**None**7**by road>> #DELETE#12#respectively. There is a key difference between <<goods**T1**Coherence**None**10**pie charts>> and methods of <<transportation**T12**Noun_number**None**15**transportations>>: one third of all <<goods transported**T13**Word_choice**None**15**transportations>> by rail is metals and it <<approximates**T14**lex_item_choice**None**12**appropriates>> to 35%. In contrast, <<one-tenth**T23**Spelling**None**9**one tenth>> of all goods transported by road are metals. There is a <<sixfold**T16**Spelling**None**8**six fold>> difference between <<the percentage numbers**T21**Articles**None**10**percentage>> of machinery transportation - 12% and 2% transported by rail and by road <<correspondingly**T18**lex_item_choice**None**13**in comparison>>.
To sum it up, one main trend could be pointed out - the transportation of goods between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008 depended on the kind of goods. The <<percentage numbers**T19**Absence_comp_colloc**Dependent_change**10**percentage>> <<illustrate**T20**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**11**illustrates>> that only manufactured goods <<do not rely**T21**Tense_form**None**12**are not rely>> on the means of transportation, this kind of goods can be called mobile.
