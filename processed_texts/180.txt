The graph illustrates the situation with lack of workplaces in different parts of the world since 2014 until 2015.
To begin with, North Africa represented stability. That is to say, the unemployment rate reached 12,5% during both 2014 and 2015. The same dynamics <<is shown**T1**Tense_form**None**9**is showed>> in South Africa and <<worldwide**T2**Capitalisation**None**9**Worldwide>> with 3,9% and 5,9%, <<respectively**T3**lex_item_choice**None**11**accordingly>>. <<The Middle East**T4**Articles**None**11**Middle East>> improved the indicators and declined <<the unemployment rate**T252**Absence_explanation**None**12**unemployment>> by 1,4%. So <<did**T5**Tense_choice**None**2**do>> Latin America <<reducing it**T253**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**decreasing>> by 1%. On the contrary, the rate in <<the EU**T6**Articles**None**2**EU>> <<showed**T254**lex_item_choice**None**3**had>> <<an increase**T7**Articles**None**8**increase>> of 0,4%.
The worst indicators belonged to North Africa, while <<the best ones**T8**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**the best>> took place in South Asia. Besides, the latter one’s rate <<consisted of**T9**Prepositional_verb**None**9**consisted>> a quarter of the first one’s. The <<average**T10**lex_item_choice**None**6**median>> value related to <<the EU**T11**Articles**None**2**EU>>. And the general rate of the whole world was <<twice**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**double>> less<< than**T13**Punctuation**None**6**, than>> the highest unemployment rate in the graph.
To sum it up, the common tendency in the world <<changed**T14**Tense_choice**None**11**has changed>> slightly. Mostly, countries <<stayed**T15**Tense_choice**None**11**have stayed>> at the same level. <<The Middle East**T16**Articles**None**11**Middle East>> and Latin America improved the situation, but only the latter part of the world <<had**T17**Tense_choice**None**3**has>> a leap in the world unemployment rating. It <<moved**T18**Tense_choice**None**9**has moved>> from the fourth place to the fifth place.
