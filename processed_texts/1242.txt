In our contemporary era of globalization the issue of technologies which <<have**T1**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> an effect on human’s health is sharp as never before. There is a fact that technologies <<have**T2**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> a harmful effect on <<people's health**T3**Absence_explanation**None**10**the health>>. But there is a <<qustion of**T4**Prepositions**None**8**question>> how this problem might be solved.

In our everyday life we are <<connected to**T5**Prepositional_verb**None**14**connected with>> a huge amount of technologies which #DELETE#3#are, on the one hand, make our life easier, but <<, on the other hand,**T7**Punctuation**None**18**on the other hand,>> <<cause**T8**Spelling**None**4**case>> a lot of problem with our health. So, for instance, we use mobile phones not only for <<calling someone**T9**Absence_explanation**None**7**calling>>, but also for reading books or surfing on different web-sites and social networks. <<When doing this regularly**T11**Punctuation**None**25**When doing this regularly>> our eyes become weaker. The same situation is with computers, which we use for work or even games. The other problem is that every device <<produces**T13**Agreement_errors**None**6**produc>>e special rays<< which are really harmful for humans**T14**Defining**None**37**, which are really harmful for humans>>, because they may cause hazards diseases such as cancer. Moreover, <<it is popular to listen to music**T15**Standard**None**40**it is because popular to listen to music>> with earphones very loud, this may cause serious problems with ears and you might even <<become**T19**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> <<deaf**T18**Spelling**None**3**def>>. 

There are <<a lot**T20**Inappropriate_register**None**4**lots>> of ways how to solve this problem, but <<they**T22**Ref_device**None**2**it>> <<would not**T21**Inappropriate_register**None**8**wouldn’t>> work if people <<would not**T23**Tense_choice**None**5**isn’t>> follow the rules. For example, to make your eyes stronger you should spend about 20 minutes on special exercises for eyes. You should also listen to music on <<the lower mode**T24**Articles**None**12**a lower mode>> or without earphones. In case with rays, you should spend less time around such devices and <<spend**T25**Tense_choice**None**5**spent>> more time walking with friends. 

In conclusion, <<I would like to say:**T26**Punctuation**None**19**I would like to say>> even if we are very close to devices <<, such as**T27**Punctuation**None**7**such as>> mobile phones, computers, we should spend more time on the other activities, otherwise we <<will turn**T28**Absence_explanation**None**4**will>> into robots.
