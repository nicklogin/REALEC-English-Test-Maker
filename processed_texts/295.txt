Our country is fighting with the free copying and sharing music or films on the <<Internet**T1**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> <<nowadays**T2**Spelling**None**10**nower days>>. This theme is highly debated in the social media and news. Some people are of the opinion that this (<<illegal**T3**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> copying) is <<a theft**T4**Articles**None**5**theft>>, and I am <<completely**T5**Spelling**None**10**compleatly>> agree with <<these**T6**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> people. In this essay I am going to discuss why copying and sharing music and films is a fraud.
Firstly, I <<should**T7**Spelling**None**5**sould>> say that this activity is <<illegal**T8**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> and there is nothing to discuss why free sharing is a theft. Scientists say that 15 per cent of young people (people of age under 25 years) are in jail due to this kind of fraud. In this way, <<if you are trying to publish any pirate copies on the Internet,**T12**Punctuation**None**62**if you are trying to publish any pirate copies on the Internet>> you are <<risking going**T13**Verb_Gerund**None**13**risking to go>> to <<prison**T14**Articles**None**10**the prison>>.
Secondly, <<if you are an internet pirate,**T17**Punctuation**None**29**if you are an internet pirate>> you are stealing from a <<famous**T41**lex_item_choice**None**9**seledrity>> person. On the other hand, if you are downloading any content from the <<Internet**T21**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>, your <<favorite**T22**Spelling**None**7**favorit>> music, for example, you are stealing from your <<favorite**T23**Spelling**None**7**favorit>> musician <<, or**T24**Punctuation**None**2**or>> if you are downloading a film, you are stealing from your <<favorite**T25**Spelling**None**7**favorit>> actor or <<actress**T26**Spelling**None**6**actris>>.
Some people could say that the <<percentage**T27**lex_item_choice**None**5**amout>> of people who are able to pay for the music and films is lower than 50 per cent. May be it is true but we should <<understand**T28**Spelling**None**10**anderstand>> that there are a lot of programs which <<give**T29**Agreement_errors**None**5**gives>> an opportunity to <<buy**T30**Spelling**None**2**by>> something for free or with a big discount. <<These**T31**Agreement_errors**None**4**This>> programs are <<available**T32**Spelling**None**8**avalible>> for poor people, <<the unemployed**T41**Articles**None**10**umenployed>> and for students.
To sum up, I <<should**T36**Spelling**None**5**sould>> say that <<pirate**T37**Spelling**None**6**pirote>> copies of music and films are <<illegal**T38**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> and <<immoral**T39**Prefix**None**7**unmoral>>. I hope that <<pirate**T40**Spelling**None**6**pirote>> copies will <<stop existing**T41**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**10**stop exist>> in the nearest future.
