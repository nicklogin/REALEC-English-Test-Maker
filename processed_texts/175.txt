Almost everything can be found in <<the Web**T8**Articles**None**3**Web>> nowadays: many people download a huge <<number**T1**Often_confused**None**6**amount>> of files every day. But what about the copyright? <<Authors**T2**Spelling**None**6**Autors>> of films, books and music pieces <<cannot**T331**Spelling**None**7**can not>> get money for their work if it was published illegally by pirates. Are users <<who**T3**Conjunctions**None**5**which>> download illegal content guilty too?
<<Actually,**T4**Punctuation**None**8**Actually>> <<most**T6**Quantifiers**None**8**the most>> musicians earn money nowadays by playing live concerts <<, which fans visit anyway**T7**Non_defining**None**23**which fans visit anyway>> – no matter whether they have records of the last album or not. <<Most of the film makers' salary**T5**Quantifiers**None**36**The most part of film makers’ salary>> <<consists**T332**lex_item_choice**None**8**contains>> of money recieved by them from the cinemas, not from selling copies of the film for home watching. The <<loss**T9**Category_confusion**None**4**lose>> of money because of pirates is not so great as it seems #DELETE#5#to be. There <<are**T10**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> a lot of ways to encourage the author of a song or of a film you like. On the one hand, if you <<have to buy**T335**Modals**None**9**first buy>> <<without being**T334**Confusion_of_structures**None**11**and you are>> able to listen or to watch, you cannot say <<in advance**T336**Word_choice**None**10**beforehand>> <<whether or not**T337**Conjunctions**None**4**that>> you will like it. <<It would be more reasonable for people to try first**T11**Standard**None**51**For people it would be more reasonable first to try>> (to download a free copy) and then to donate to the author if the film or the song is really good. On the other hand, a lot of people like to use free copies of their favorite films and music pieces without any donation to the authors. Pirates <<upload**T13**Tense_choice**None**8**uploaded>> these files to the <<Internet**T14**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> but is using <<them**T338**Ref_device**None**2**it>> honest?
So, I <<partly agree**T339**Confusion_of_structures**None**15**am partly agree>> with the opinion that users <<who**T17**Agreement_errors**None**5**which>> download illegal content must be punished. <<I suppose,**T16**Punctuation**None**9**I suppose>> they have a right to try the product before buying it. But if they <<find**T18**Tense_choice**None**5**found>> the content pleasant and want to continue using it – they must “<<give thanks**T341**lex_part_choice**None**10**say thanks>>” to the <<authors**T17**Spelling**None**6**autors>>.
