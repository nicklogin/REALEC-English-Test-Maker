Because in cyber platform it is impossible to stop the process of sharing information. For example, police just can not punish all of the people who download pirate copies because it can be millions of them.

On another hand, people who download pirate copies from the Internet usually do not have opportunity to buy each song and each movie. Some of the artist can be not allowed in different countries so you can not enjoy their art. By the way, today pirateâ€™s activities are not allowed in countries like USA or Europe.
