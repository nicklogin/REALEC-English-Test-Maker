Today there are more and more crimes committed by young people. It is obvious that also there are many reasons why they do it.
I am absolutely convinced that youth are growing without paying attention to their parents and also teachers. Moreover, children are not getting social and emotional knowledge at their schools. It is one of the main factors to increase crime among youth. Secondly, action movies with murders and robberies are popular amongst youth. It can be clearly seen that these sorts of movies lead to an increase in crime among teenagers as they try to copy what they have seen in the movies.  Furthermore, films have an important influence on young people who are influenced both by what they watch and hear.
To solve this problem a number of actions needs to be made. First of all, parents should know what their children do. Educational talks in a friendly atmosphere will help parents and children to be closer. To my mind, children until they are 18 shouldn`t be allowed to watch action films and games.
Also in schools teachers should know which interests pupils have. The behavior also can say a lot. If they notice children are aggressive and disobedient, they should inform parents.
To sum up, it is important to be in touch with oncoming generation to prevent such terrible events.
