The charts below depict <<The transportation**T1**Articles**None**14**transportation>> of goods in Eastern Europe during 2008. These charts show and give information <<to compare**T2**Category_confusion**None**17**for comparison of>> <<the transportation**T3**Articles**None**14**transportation>> by rail and by road. It is clear that <<the proportions**T28**Noun_number**Dependent_change**10**proportion>> of different types of goods transported by rail <<are**T6**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> not the same with <<the proportions**T28**Noun_number**None**10**proportion>> of goods transported by rail. The first <<chart**T9**Noun_number**None**6**charts>> shows that there is <<a great proportion**T10**Articles**None**16**great proportion>> of metals (35%) <<that was**T11**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**was>> transported by rail <<, whilst**T12**Punctuation**None**6**whilst>> on the second chart <<this proportions is**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**15**this proportion>> only 11% and the biggest proportion of goods transported by rail is <<the proportion**T14**Articles**None**10**proportion>> of food (30%). 

However, <<the proportions**T15**Articles**None**11**proportions>> of some types of goods do not have significant differences. For instance, manufactured <<goods**T16**Noun_number**None**4**good>>: it is 25 % on the first chart and 28% on the second chart. There is no significant differences in <<the proportions**T17**Articles**None**11**proportions>> of chemicals either: on the first chat it is 11%, and on the second  - 16%. Also, it is necessary to write more about <<the differences**T18**Articles**None**11**differences>> of these charts. <<The proportion**T19**Articles**None**10**Proportion>> of machinery goods transported by rail <<is**T20**Spelling**None**2**it>> bigger than <<the proportion**T21**Articles**None**10**proportion>> of these <<goods**T22**Noun_number**None**4**good>> transported by road. 

To conclude, there <<are**T24**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> some <<similar**T23**lex_item_choice**None**4**same>> features in the charts <<, but**T25**Punctuation**None**3**but>> <<the majority**T26**Articles**None**8**majority>> of metals was transported by rail <<, whilst**T27**Punctuation**None**6**whilst>> <<the majority**T28**Articles**None**8**majority>> of food products was transported by road, not by rail.
