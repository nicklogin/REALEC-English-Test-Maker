Some people claim that young people nowadays are more likely to commit a crime than ever before. In my opinion, the modern way of life makes children more cruel and lonely which lead to boost in crimes among teenagers.
To begin with, there are many reasons why young people decide to commit a crime. Firstly, the content that we see on TV or Youtube is mostly violent. Computer and telephone games are full of murders, blood and cruelty. It is not a surprise that after seeing crimes everywhere a person decriminalizes it in his or her head and starts to think that it is normal. Secondly, adults are tent to work more nowadays, which is why parents does not communicate with their children much. It can lead to kids' depression and a feeling of loneliness. To draw the parents' attention, kids become thieves because it seems to be The only way to become visibe for parents. The last but not the least, it is extremely difficult for a young person to find a job in modern society because of lack of working experience. It can lead to stealing. Not being able to earn enough money legally, young people start being involved in illegal actions.
The most significant issue here is to find a way of tackling this problem. To my mind, parents should spend more time with children, explain them that there is always a way of solving a problem without cruelty. Parents should give their kids enough love, care and support, which will lead to better emotional health of children. As for teachers, they should talk more about values, be role models for children and explain that kids can become successful while being honest and kind.
To sum, there is a problem of a widespread criminal involvement among young people, but parents and teachers could help solving it.
