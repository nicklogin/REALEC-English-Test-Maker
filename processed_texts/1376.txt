Modern <<technologies**T1**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> become more popular in our days. There are many advantages of <<them**T2**Ref_device**None**12**this process>>. But the number of disadvanteges is the same. Many people think that one of them is <<the increasing number**T4**Articles**None**20**an increasing number>> of <<diseases**T5**lex_item_choice**None**7**illness>>. I agree with them.

First of all, people <<spend**T6**Spelling**None**4**send>> a lot of time in front of <<tv**T7**lex_item_choice**None**9**televisio>>n, computer and other modern <<devices**T8**lex_item_choice**None**7**technic>>s.  This lifestyle <<leads to**T9**lex_item_choice**None**9**follow to>> different awful problems with body and eyes, even <<to blindness**T10**Prepositions**None**9**blindness>>. <<Despite this fact,**T11**Punctuation**None**17**Despite this fact>> people continue to spend their time in such way, they watch TV or play #DELETE#2#in <<computer games**T12**Absence_explanation**None**8**computer>> like crazy. So people become lazier and then fat. <<An obesity**T39**Articles**None**12**Extra weight>> – <<is another**T16**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**another>> important problem in our life. Fat people die earlier than thin.

<<The other**T17**Often_confused**None**7**Another>> big problem is pollution. The number of caus <<increases**T19**Agreement_errors**None**8**increase>> every day. <<The air**T39**Articles**None**10**Atmosphere>> <<becomes**T22**Agreement_errors**None**6**become>> more and more <<polluted**T23**Spelling**None**7**pollute>>. <<It**T28**Ref_device**None**4**This>> #DELETE#4#fact <<, of course,**T24**Punctuation**None**9**of course>> <<influences**T26**Transitive**None**12**influence on>> our health.

There are many ways to solve <<these**T29**Ref_device**None**4**this>> problems. Firstly, people <<should not**T30**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn’t>> spend so much time with modern gadgets. <<It has**T31**Inappropriate_register**None**4**It’s>> become a part of our life, but it<<does not**T33**Inappropriate_register**None**8**’s don’t>> mean that people should use gadgets all the time like <<zombies**T34**Noun_number**None**5**zombi>>. <<Also,**T35**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> people must <<folllow**T36**lex_item_choice**None**5**relay>> some rules when using modern technics. For example, <<not to seat**T38**Tense_form**None**11**do not seat>> too close to computers or TV. Secondly, people should built special buildings wich will help to clean <<the atmosphere**T39**Articles**None**10**atmosphere>>.
