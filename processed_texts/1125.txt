<<It**T1**Ref_device**None**4**This>> is true that musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year from illegal pirate copies because copying and sharing music or films on the <<Internet**T2**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> is <<a theft**T3**Articles**None**5**theft>> and people who download these files instead of buying the original discs should be punished.

First of all, not everyone knows <<how difficult it is**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**13**how difficult>> to create some music or movies. This is <<a really hard work**T5**Articles**None**16**really hard work>><< that**T7**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<needs**T8**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> lots of time, money and health to make really good <<products**T9**lex_item_choice**None**5**stuff>>. 

<<Second,**T10**Punctuation**None**6**Second>> we <<all know**T11**Tense_form**None**12**are all know>> that life is better when you can have something for free, because not everyone can afford to buy CD’s or DVD for <<a high price**T12**Articles**None**10**high price>> because video and music shops make <<some profit**T13**lex_item_choice**None**1**%>> for each CD or DVD, so <<it is**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> better to find things <<on the Internet**T15**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>> <<, just**T16**Punctuation**None**4**just>> put the ‘free’ word <<while searching**T17**Absence_explanation**None**9**searching>>. 

However, I think that not all #DELETE#2#of films and music <<cost**T19**Spelling**None**3**cos>> their money, because now people that make movies or music think that they can do some junk-movie or junk-music<< just**T20**Punctuation**None**6**, just>> to make a lot of money, and <<it is**T21**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> not quite good, because they are not artists; they just want your money, not respect. 

<<In conclusion,**T23**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I want to say that not all #DELETE#6#of the producers or musicians <<deserve**T25**Spelling**None**7**desirve>> your money. Because they are not <<honest**T26**lex_item_choice**None**4**true>> with you or with themselves. I said that it is hard to create, but creating something to show people <<the world**T27**Articles**None**5**world>> inside you just because you want it; <<only this**T30**Standard**None**12**this is only>> <<deserves**T29**Spelling**None**7**desirve>> money and respect of people. And the persons who want just money j<<are just fake artists**T32**Absence_comp_sent**None**23**ust stupid fake artists>>.
