The topic use of steroids and other drugs in competitions is widely discused now with the main question of whether athletes who use them should be repelled from competitions and if so then for how long they should be banned. There are many opinions on this topic, and both views should be considered.
Some people think that those who illegally use drugs to achieve higher results in such huge and important competitions as, for example, Olympic games have to be banned for their whole life. In their opinion it is absolutely unacceptable to have people with such reputation of cheaters on any country's team, when there has to be somebody else with same results reached with the help of natural abilities. That, as they believe, should seve as an example to those who consider ever cheating the rules of sport competitions.
On the other hand, however, there is another point of view. The other group of people holds on to the opinion that athletes should only be repelled for a specific period of time, which might be two or five years. To them it seems like a more sane decision, because even if an athlete used drugs, it might have been a good lesson to him, and he will not ever do it again because he learned it well. Also, sometimes claims of drug use can be fabricated, so the person accused might not even think of it, but would be sentenced anyway. There is a lot of politics involved, so it is not a rare case, therefore it is unfair to take somebody's dream away just by supposing that he has done something wrong.
I personally think that it would be more accurate to ban athletes for about two years to give them time to regroup and reflect on their future career. 
In conclusion, I have to say that everybody believes banning is necessary, although, different conditions should be stated by the low and applied to everybody; the amount of time for which an athlete should be banned can be extended if necessary.
