The development of our world causes significant technology progress, the consequences of <<which**T1**Spelling**None**6**wheich>> are <<undiscovered**T2**Spelling**None**11**undiscoverd>>. The impact of the progress on our health is one of the most important problem—é
Firstly, the quantity of vehicles in cities <<is becoming**T4**Tense_form**None**12**are becoming>> dangerous because of gases and this way cause serious deseases. The nature is suffering from this problem either.
However, such spreading of cars <<solves**T5**Spelling**None**6**sloves>> many transport troubles makes the world more developed and convenient. <<It is**T6**Spelling**None**4**Itis>> obvious that popularisation of electronic cars will solve this problem comprehensevly.
Secondly, nowadays large part of electricity <<is getting**T7**Tense_form**None**11**are getting>> from nuclear-electro stations, although Chernobyl and Fukusima tragedies demonstrated the instability and dangerous of this way getting energy. Such accidents lead to terrible pollution which harms people and nature.
Nevertheless, accurate and proper using of <<nuclear-electro**T8**Spelling**None**16**neuclear-electro>> stations with new safe technologies may be the most sensible way of getting energy infuture. Bisedes, the solar pannels and modern batteries allow us to accumulate energy and use it when there is no sun shining. This was is said to be the most green one <<in the**T9**Spelling**None**5**inthe>> world, so the developing of it is essential.to conclude, the modern technologies are obviously harmful for our health, but it is not reason to deny them but to develop them further and further to make the safier and more harmless.
