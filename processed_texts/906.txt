In this description will be given information fron two diagrams: Goods transported by rail, Goods transported by road. Rail logistics in <<Eastern**T2**Spelling**None**6**Easter>> <<Europe**T1**Capitalisation**None**6**europe>> is mostly connected with <<resources**T3**Spelling**None**8**resurses>>. The most significant part of it is metals. They (metals) took more than one third of total transportion. Next to metals is manufactured goods, which take one quater of whole amount. Machinery is not so valuable for rail transportation, that is why it is 12% of rail logistics. The lowest part ofrailtransportation is separated by three goods: Chemicals (11%), Non-metallic minerals (<11%), Food products (11%). Road transportation differs from goods transported by rail in Almost each and every aspect. The leaders of transportion are food products(30%), but manufactured goods are not far away from food logistics (28%). Metal transportation (11%) is not as valueble in road transportation as in rail. Chemical and non-metallic minerals trans portation is quite the sume as in rail logistics, difference is in few percents. The most significant comparison point is connected win metals. road transportation is not supposted for metal transportation, as it can be seen from diagram.
