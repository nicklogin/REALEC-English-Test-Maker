Nowadays there are more and more sportsmen using drugs <<for their sports achievements**T1**Absence_explanation**None**15**in their sports>>. The issue is being discussed now more often than any <<time**T2**Noun_number**None**5**times>> <<before**T4**Often_confused**None**7**earlier>>. All <<technologies**T3**Articles**None**16**the technologies>> are developing <<, and**T5**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<sport cannot pass them by**T65**Standard**None**22**it can't pass by sport>>. Cases of <<athletes**T7**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> caught using drugs are so common that the issue of the punishment they <<deserve**T10**lex_item_choice**None**11**have to get>> is really <<crucial**T8**Spelling**None**7**crusial>>.
There is an opinion that <<athletes**T11**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> who <<have used**T14**Tense_choice**None**4**used>> banned drugs have to be <<disqualified from**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**out of>> professional sport for a limited period. It seems #DELETE#5#to be fair because sometimes it is not the <<athlete's**T41**Possessive**None**7**athlete>> fault, <<for instance,**T66**Punctuation**None**12**for instance>> when <<the drug**T68**Ref_device**None**2**it>> <<has been**T22**Tense_choice**None**3**was>> used by doctors to make an <<athlete**T17**Spelling**None**5**atlet>> feel better and make the pain <<less agonizing**T18**Absence_explanation**None**4**less>>. Sometimes it is <<not clear whether or not**T19**Word_choice**None**19**not so obvious that>> some months later the pills will be <<classified**T20**lex_item_choice**None**9**confirmed>> as drugs. So, banning the <<athlete**T23**Spelling**None**6**athlet>> from competing for the rest of his or her life is too strict.
<<On the other hand**T24**lex_part_choice**None**19**From the other hand>>, drugs have their influence on <<sports**T26**Noun_attribute**None**5**sport>> results even if <<they**T28**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**it>> <<were**T70**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**was>> used as medicine - we can't ignore this fact, and usually doctors know about the effects <<but**T31**Linking_device**None**3**and>> they use them anyway. Sometimes it is just <<the coach**T25**Articles**None**5**coach>> who is informed about the pills' effect and they use them on purpose. <<However,**T36**Punctuation**None**7**However>> strict <<punishments**T39**Noun_number**None**10**punishment>> for the <<athlete**T33**Spelling**None**5**atlet>> such as being <<disqualified from**T37**lex_item_choice**None**6**out of>> professional competition for the rest of <<athlete's**T34**Spelling**None**8**athlet's>> life can make coaches think twice before cheating.
In my opinion, <<disqualification for life**T45**Standard**None**31**whole the life disqualification>> should exist as a #DELETE#7#form of possible punishment, as a <<reminder**T32**lex_item_choice**None**4**note>> for all the <<athletes**T47**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> to be honest#DELETE#1#: with themselves, their fans <<, and**T49**Punctuation**None**3**and>> other competitors<<.**T50**Punctuation**Dependent_change**1**,>> <<However,**T41**Punctuation**None**7**however>> <<the proof**T41**Articles**None**5**proof>> <<has**T30**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**4**have>> to be strong and obvious to use this kind of banning. For <<most cases**T40**Determiners**None**14**most the cases>>, from my point of view, we <<have to ban**T55**Modals**None**17**have ban athletes>> <<for using drugs**T57**Absence_explanation**None**9**for drugs>> for <<several**T59**lex_item_choice**None**4**some>> years. It's enough to make <<an athlete**T41**Articles**None**7**athlete>> think twice <<and**T60**Linking_device**None**3**but>> there is a chance to prove their right <<to participate in sports**T63**Absence_explanation**None**9**for sport>>. <<However**T62**Linking_device**None**7**Athough>>, an <<athlete**T42**Spelling**None**5**athet>> <<caught**T41**Spelling**None**7**cauught>> using drugs more than once has to be banned forever.
