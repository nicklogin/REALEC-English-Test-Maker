Nowadays, some people think that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionally for a limited period of time. Some others think that such athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. This essay will discuss both points of view. On the one hand, there is no doubt that using illegal drugs to boost you physical <<abilities**T1**Spelling**None**10**abbilities>> and improve your scores <<in**T2**Prepositions**None**2**on>> <<the competition**T3**Articles**None**11**competition>> is dishonest, unethical and unsportive. Such athletes distort <<people's**T18**Possessive**None**6**people>> <<image**T19**Often_confused**None**11**imagination>> <<of**T20**Prepositions**None**5**about>> professional sport and consequently decrease <<people's**T21**Possessive**None**6**people>> <<interest in**T22**Prepositional_noun**None**11**interest to>> them. <<From this point of view,**T4**Punctuation**None**23**From this point of view>> I can agree with those who think that such athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. Another supportive argument#DELETE#1#, <<is that**T5**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**that>> banning athletes for the rest of their lives we can ensure that those people will stop using <<drugs**T6**Spelling**None**6**druggs>>. It will <<prevent**T24**lex_item_choice**None**19**cause a decrease of>> drug expansion <<among**T23**Prepositions**None**7**between>> athletes, and it will <<improve**T7**Spelling**None**8**improove>> their health condition. On the other hand, everybody makes mistakes. We can imagine that <<an athlete**T8**Articles**None**7**athlete>> in <<his**T26**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> <<search of**T25**Prepositional_verb**None**7**seek to>> achievements, <<is ready**T27**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**ready>> to try everything to increase <<his or her**T28**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> <<abilities**T9**Spelling**None**10**abbilities>>. <<Unsurprisingly,**T29**Linking_device**None**13**In that case,>> using illegal drugs is the easiest way to achieve your goals. The best way to eliminate athlete's hesitations<< about whether or not to use drugs**T30**Conjunctions**None**30**: to use drugs, or not to use,>> is a limited time <<ban**T13**Spelling**None**4**bann>>. Using this solution for the problem of illegal drugs using, we can ensure that after athletes return to professional competitions, <<they**T14**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**he>> will never try to improve <<their**T15**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**his>> skills by using drugs. <<In conclusion,**T16**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> we can state#DELETE#1#, that illegal drugs are absolutely <<unacceptable**T31**Spelling**None**13**un acceptable>> in professional sport, and <<athletes**T32**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> caught using <<drugs**T33**Redundant_comp**None**10**this drugs>> should be banned, but the period of their <<ban**T34**Spelling**None**4**bann>> <<should depend**T35**Modals**None**14**should depends>> on the situation.
