The presented diagrams show percentage of goods transported on the territory of Eastern Europe by rail and road in 2008.
Different amounts of goods are transported by road and rail. As can be seen from the diagragms, metals contribute approximately one third of all transported by rail staff, and only one tenth part of all goods <<is transported**T1**Voice**None**11**transported>> by road. In contrast, the percentage of <<goods delivered by rail**T2**Standard**None**23**delivered by rail goods>> is lower than by road and reaches only 11% <<in comparison with**T3**lex_part_choice**None**14**comparing with>> 16%. Approximately the same part of <<manufactured**T4**Category_confusion**None**11**manufacture>> goods is delivered by rail and road, however, <<the part constituted by food products**T5**Possessive**None**19**food products' part>> in the whole delivery by rail is around 3 times lower and contributes 11%. Moreover, <<machinery transported by road**T6**Standard**None**29**transported by road machinery>> <<amounts to**T8**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> only 2% <<in contrast**T9**Spelling**None**11**is contrast>> with 12% by rail and <<non-metallic minerals transited by road**T7**Standard**None**39**transited by road non-metallic minerals>> <<contribute**T10**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> 13% which is higher that the amount transported by rail.
After all, it can be noticed that the ways of transportation of goods are different and depend on the form and quality of transited staff.
