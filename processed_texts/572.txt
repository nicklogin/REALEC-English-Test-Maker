Money spendings on space exploration <<are often questioned**T363**Tense_choice**None**26**are often being questioned>> by some people, because they say that money being used by space programs <<is**T2**Tense_form**None**3**are>> more needed on some more <<applicable**T364**Spelling**None**9**appliable>> things, like society problems or environmental issues. In my point of view people that are against space programs are right in some aspects but <<i**T365**Capitalisation**None**1**i>> disagree with them in their main argument -- "space exploration is a waste of money".
First point for space exploration -- it's going to be very crucial for our society in some centuries or even earlier. Space programs are the main vector of development for humanity, because the possibilites are truly unlimited. N<<No one**T366**Spelling**None**5**Noone>>knows what space hides from us so we need to invest (not waste) our money in space development. The second concept of mine is about the difficulties of resolving society problems with just money. When you will remove all space exploration programs, that money cannot just go and remove all problems, conflicts and so on. They actually will just disappear in government and all issues will remain untouched. The third thing that i<<i**T367**Capitalisation**None**1**i>>should note about space -- it's about army too. Space is a great place of developing some brand new ways of defeating the enemy or defending from attacks. For example, there are some serious defense from rockets systems that are located in space. And n<<no one**T368**Spelling**None**5**noone>>will remove them, until some kind of convention against it will come out. My only point against space exploration is t<<the fact that**T369**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**the fact of>>governments of different countries are corrupt, and money that would go i<<under**T370**Pronouns**None**2**in>>n<<a normal government**T371**Articles**None**17**normal government>>for space development will be taken by someone. But that won't happen in private projects like Space-X.
In the end I want to state that space exploring is a good investement in our future, but we should never forget about people and our planet Earth. Ac<<Actually,**T373**Punctuation**None**8**Actually>>ome projects of space exploration are de<<definitely**T372**Spelling**None**9**definitly>>aste, but most of them are very useful.
