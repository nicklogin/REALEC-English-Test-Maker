The pie charts illustrate the information about two different ways of goods transportation and portions of varied goods transported by rail and road between Eastern European countries in 2008.
Firstly, it is seen from the graphs that different kinds of goods were mostly transported by different means. However, there were two exceptions. The portion of chemicals transported by rail was accounted for 11% and its percentage of goods transported by road was 16%, that is almost equal to the first one. Manufactured goods took approximately a quater of all goods transported in both situations. On the other hand, percentage of other goods differed dramatically. Metals were mostly transported by rail and their portion <<accounted for**T2**Voice**None**17**was accounted for>> 35%, while food products and non-metallic minerals <<accounted for**T3**Voice**None**18**were accounted for>> 17% together. Looking at the second graph, it is seen that <<the situation**T1**Articles**None**9**situation>> changes. Portion of food product was a third of overall goods transported by rail and portions of metals and non-metallic minerals were almost equal.
