In my opinion, music and films are <<pieces**T1**Articles**None**10**the pieces>> of art. Nowadays the majority of people <<choose to copy**T2**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**11**choose copy>> or download them for free<< instead of**T3**Punctuation**None**12**, instead of>> buying the original discs<< because of**T6**Punctuation**None**12**, because of>> <<big prices**T4**Articles**None**14**the big prices>>. And most of us <<wonder:**T8**Punctuation**None**7**wonder,>> <<why should we spend**T9**Word_order**None**19**why we should spend>> so much money for art?

Most people would <<agree**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**accept>> that today <<musicians**T13**Articles**None**13**the musicians>> and film producers <<set huge prices on**T15**Prepositions**None**19**set huge prices for>> <<their**T11**Spelling**None**5**there>> works. And most of us do not understand, <<why is it**T17**Word_order**None**9**why it is>> so expensive. #DELETE#7#Because music and films should improve your mind<< by causing**T19**Punctuation**None**12**, by causing>> <<emotions**T20**Articles**None**11**an emotions>>. 

Art can induce aversion, incomprehension, stupor or fear, #DELETE#27#especially modern component. And most of us would agree that this is all because of artists, who <<have learnt**T22**Tense_choice**None**7**learned>> how to convey to the masses their vision. And art must always be a cause of #DELETE#3#any persons emotions<<. But**T24**Punctuation**None**5**, But>> <<how can it rise**T25**Word_order**None**15**how it can rise>> any emotions if you have <<no**T26**Spelling**None**3**not>> money for it.

<<In conclusion**T27**Punctuation**None**14**In conclusion,>> I would say that art, such as music and films, can expand your horizons about life and the world generally by improving your skills, capabilities, intelligence and mind. It will make you feel reality better, sometimes by strange methods, but it will be <<the cause**T28**Articles**None**7**a cause>> of variety of your emotions. So it needs to be free for all of us.
