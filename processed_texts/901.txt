Musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year from illegal pirate copies. Copying and sharing music or films on the <<Internet**T1**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> is theft <<, and**T2**Punctuation**None**3**and>> people <<who download these files instead of buying the original discs**T19**Agreement_errors**None**61**who download these files, instead of buying the original CDs,>> should be punished. To what extent do you agree or disagree? First of all, in modern age of <<the Internet**T16**Articles**None**8**internet>> and technologies people have fun in many ways <<, and**T6**Punctuation**None**3**and>> the most popular way is sharing music and films on the <<Internet**T7**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. #DELETE#6#In the <<First,**T16**Punctuation**None**5**first>> #DELETE#22#place in this question <<one should take**T22**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**should take>> into account the <<fact**T20**Spelling**None**3**act>><< that**T21**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> many people can’t afford to buy music or film. These people <<compensate for**T27**lex_item_choice**None**8**suppress>> their need with downloading and <<sharing**T26**Spelling**None**8**sharying>> films or music on the internet. <<This**T8**Pronouns**None**5**These>> way, of course, is <<the easiest**T9**Comparative_adj**None**13**the most easy>> and <<the most comfortable**T10**Comparative_adj**None**11**comfortable>>. But if you <<look at it**T29**Transitive**None**4**look>> from the <<producers' and musicians' point of view**T28**Absence_explanation**None**23**producers and musicians>> it brings huge <<losses**T30**Spelling**None**5**loses>>. Imagine that you did a great job and in the end you did not receive <<sufficient**T11**Spelling**None**10**suffycient>> payment for <<this**T12**Agreement_errors**None**5**these>> work. In this situation, anyone would feel cheated because any work #DELETE#7#and job, especially <<creative,**T13**Coherence**None**8**creative>> must be <<rewarded**T32**lex_item_choice**None**4**paid>>. After all, <<creativity**T33**Articles**None**14**the creativity>> and arts bring people pleasure and <<a very good way**T34**Absence_explanation**None**9**very good>> to relax. In the end, I am of the opinion that <<films**T35**Articles**None**9**the films>> and music should be online, but <<they**T36**Pronouns**None**2**it>> should not cost so much. Most often, <<a person**T37**Articles**None**10**the person>> comes to <<a commercial site**T39**Articles**None**15**commercial site>> and sees a large <<number**T40**lex_item_choice**None**6**amount>> of licensed <<movies**T41**Noun_number**None**5**movie>> and thinks that <<for that money**T42**Prepositions**None**9**the money>> <<he**T43**Agreement_errors**None**2**he>> could to go and see that film <<in the cinema**T16**Articles**None**9**at cinema>>. Therefore, I agree that online films and music can <<be paid for**T44**Tense_form**None**11**be paid for>>, but they <<should not be**T16**Modals**None**6**aren’t>> be so expensive
