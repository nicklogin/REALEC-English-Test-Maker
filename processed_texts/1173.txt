Some people believe that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats and should #DELETE#3#aim import as little as possible.
I disagree with this <<opinion**T2**lex_item_choice**None**5**topic>>. I think, that countries need to import as <<much**T3**lex_item_choice**None**4**more>> as possible. <<The more a country imports**T5**Confusion_of_structures**None**20**Then country imports>> <<food**T4**Spelling**None**5**foodr>>  or products <<that**T6**lex_item_choice**None**5**their>> this country <<produces**T7**Agreement_errors**None**7**produce>>, <<the better results this country has on the  world's market and the richer it becomes**T8**Confusion_of_structures**None**64**than this country is more rich and big country on world’s market>>. Why <<a country**T9**Articles**None**7**country>> needs to produce only food? <<It is**T10**Inappropriate_register**None**4**It’s>> unlogical. People need clothes, houses and other <<things**T11**Spelling**None**6**thinks>> for normal life. <<it this country will buy these things**T12**Agreement_errors**None**31**If these things county will buy>> , not produce, <<it would be more expensive**T15**Conditionals**None**22**it’s be more expensive>>, than producing in <<this**T17**lex_item_choice**None**3**own>> country. Every <<social**T18**Category_confusion**None**12**socilazation>> country <<would produce**T19**Redundant**None**16**would to produce>> more think then only for food<< for own**T21**Punctuation**None**9**, for own>> population and for import.
My opinion is…
