In the modern world of technologies the problem of illegal copying is one of the most discussed. Some people think that it is unfair to copy and share files, others approve it, because they do not want to pay extra money. I agree with the first opinion: this act is not under the <<law**T1**Spelling**None**3**low>>, so people should be punished.
First of all, free copying, sharing, and downloading decrease profits of many musical and film-making firms, so it can be called <<a theft**T2**Articles**None**9**the theft>>. A great variety of producers annually spends huge sums of money to make a good film or to write and record high-qualitive music album. Due to the pirate copies all these spendings may be not covered, which means reduction in salaries of ordinary people<< who work in this company**T3**Defining**None**26**, who work in this company>>. Moreover, even further producing of media content can be stopped.
The second reason for my opinion is that a great range of companies spends a significant part of their profit on some social <<needs**T4**Noun_number**None**4**need>>, which is presented by different <<funds**T5**Spelling**None**5**fonds>>. These <<funds**T6**Spelling**None**5**fonds>> help old people, families with many children, children<< who grow up without parents**T7**Defining**None**29**, who grow up without parents>> and many others. It means that free copying and downloading makes social welfare go down. At the same time, government now needs more money to maintain the same level of social protection, so taxes is likely to increase. The final result for the person<< who took free copy**T8**Defining**None**21**, who took free copy,>> is the same because he or she pays extra money in every case. In addition, if such people are punished, at the end they will worse off.
To sum up, pirate copying is a serious problem not only for <<certain**T10**Spelling**None**7**discret>> companies, but also for the whole population, so, in my opinion, it should be solved by introducing a special penalty for people who break the rules.
