New films appear every day in each part of the world.
There are so many films, so some people think that today nobody can find out absolutely new and original plot.
Nevertheless, the biggest percentage of films people are discussing is american.
Talking about Russia, I can say that Hollywood films catch more attention.
Why is it so?
Of course, the most obvious reason is in high quality of american production.
Films from the USA are realy interesting, contai<<contain**T2**Agreement_errors**None**8**contains>>graphics, have talant<<talented**T1**Spelling**None**8**talanted>>s in the cast.
Filming industry there is very developed and worth investing money.
Government shows big interest in regular film producing, so directors can afford expencive decorations and high-qualified workers.
Hovewer, in my opinion the main reason of this popularity is advertisement.
The ad is everywhere: on the TV, in the Internet, on the boards on the streets.
Some producers start online quizes about their films with such prises like cinema tickets, posters with actors' authographs etc.' All this stuff easely catch attention, and people become interested in what is told from everywhere.
I can't call myself film expert, in that case I want to say some my thoughts only about russian cinematography.
For some reasons, local films use wide advert company very <<campaign**T4**Often_confused**None**7**company>>nd their income show low results.
Avoiding boring and annoying ad, I want to talk about russian films themselves.
They have reputation of bad, stupid and sometimes disgusting.
Why should people spend their money on local comedy, when they are able to have a good time watching attractive film about superheroes?
The directors are interested only in money and forget about the very making a good film.
As long as directors can get money without any effort, we couldn't get attractive and amazing films.
For better results government doesn't need to increase financial support or delay foreign films, what it actualy does.
I don't want to say that Russia doesn't have talanted people, who<<talented**T3**Spelling**None**8**talanted>>ate good films.
There are, and many, but they can't get money for their ideas, because quite all financials go to small group of people.
I can't say, why investors continue give money to those directors, whose previous films had no success, and avoid the real professionals.
To conclude, I want to say that quality of films depends on advertisement and attitude.
American film industry shows high results because it pays attention to both factors.
In my country there can be two situations: bad films with good advert suppurt and good films, but nobody knows about them.
When our directors combine these factors, we will get film worth watching.
