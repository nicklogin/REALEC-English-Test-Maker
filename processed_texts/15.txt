<<The issue of illegal copying and sharing music or films**T3**Absence_explanation**None**34**Copying and sharing music or films>> on the internet is the issue that is very popular nowadays. Some people <<hold the view**T2**Articles**None**11**hold a view>> that people doing it should be punished <<, while**T5**Punctuation**None**5**while>> others do not support them. From my point of view, the second position is right.
First of all, #DELETE#23#there is the fact, that some people, for example<<, children or teenagers,**T7**Punctuation**None**23**, children or teenagers>> cannot afford to buy music albums or films to themselves. Therefore, they do not have <<a chance**T8**Articles**None**6**chance>> to <<listen to**T9**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> or watch it. What is more, musicians and film producers can <<lose**T10**Spelling**None**5**loose>> money not <<because of**T11**Prepositions**None**4**from>> illegal pirate copies <<, but**T12**Punctuation**None**3**but>> <<because**T13**Conjunctions**None**4**from>> #DELETE#18#the situation when people <<do not know**T15**Tense_choice**None**13**will not know>> about them. This is actually about musicians and producers <<who**T16**lex_item_choice**None**4**that>> are at the begining of their <<careers**T17**Agreement_errors**None**6**career>>. They need to use all possible channels to become more popular and the lack of <<access to them**T18**Absence_explanation**None**6**access>> will not <<let them do it**T19**Verb_Inf**None**17**let them to do it>>.
However, there are some problems with illegal copying. The first one is that popular film makers and musicians do not get all the income <<they can get**T20**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**they can>>. Therefore, the cannot make new films or music because <<they have a lack of money**T21**lex_item_choice**None**22**they are lack of money>>. The second one is that sometimes they do not understand how popular they really are <<, as**T24**Punctuation**None**2**as>> there is no <<evidence**T22**Spelling**None**8**evidance>> or <<statistics**T23**Spelling**None**7**statics>> about people downloading it.
These problems <<can actually be solved**T25**Standard**None**22**can be actually solved>>. <<As a solution,**T26**Punctuation**None**13**As a solution>> producers and musicians can allow to download some of their products for free and <<ask for money**T27**Prepositional_verb**None**9**ask money>> for some other. What is about the second problem, to my mind, it can be solved <<after**T28**Prepositions**None**18**in connection with>> the first one. People will <<listen to music**T29**Absence_explanation**None**6**listen>> or watch films for free and want to buy <<more of them**T30**lex_item_choice**None**9**some else>>.
To sum up, illegal copying and sharing music and films is not such a big crime <<, for which**T31**Punctuation**None**9**for which>> people should be punished #DELETE#11#in some way.
