Hardly a week <<goes by**T13**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**goes>> without <<everybody's watching**T14**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**watching>> <<a TV show**T1**Spelling**None**9**a TV-show>> or a movie. Nowadays people are keen on doing that, because it is one of the best ways to <<let the steam off**T15**lex_item_choice**None**10**decompress>> after hard-working days. Someone prefers to watch a foreign comedy, while others are fond of local films, but the <<number**T16**lex_item_choice**None**6**amount>> of <<the latter**T17**Articles**None**6**latter>> decreases steeply.
I<<I strongly believe**T2**Punctuation**None**19**I strongly believe,>>there are several reasons for this phenomenon. First and foremost, the USA and the UK are one of the most famous countries in t<<producing films**T18**Redundant**None**22**the producing of films>> Actually, their films are popular and they are shown all over the world. So, we can watch i<<them**T19**Ref_device**None**2**it>>even u<<unconsciously**T10**Spelling**None**14**uncounsciously>>by switching on a TV or visiting a cinema, because there are plenty of such films everywhere. More than that, these countries invest a huge amounts of money in f<<film**T20**Noun_attribute**None**6**film's>>production. So, their films are made w<<highly professionally**T21**Category_confusion**None**27**with a high professionalism>> a<<with amusing costumes**T22**Absence_comp_colloc**None**16**amusing costumes>>and b<<sets**T23**lex_item_choice**None**11**backgrounds>>and the m<<best**T24**lex_item_choice**None**4**most>>world-wide famous actors. It all attracts w<<audiences**T25**lex_item_choice**None**8**watchers>>f<<anywhere in the**T26**lex_item_choice**None**14**from the whole>>world. It is also undeniable,<< that**T11**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>the plot and scenes of British and American movies are more exciting. W<<At the same time**T27**lex_item_choice**None**5**While>> a<<as far as Russian films are concerned**T28**Absence_comp_colloc**None**20**as for Russian films>> their plots are rather monotonous and r<<are repeated**T29**Tense_choice**None**6**repeat>>from movie to movie. So, they become rather boring to watch and feel like routine. Additionally, we can get acquainted with different cultures, get to know their traditions and mental features through watching foreign films. I am absolutely sure, it makes people watch t<<these**T9**Spelling**None**4**tese>>films, because not everyone has an opportunity to travel round the world, to see all the amazing places of our Earth, to meet new people and to make friends. But films allow them to "<<get the feeling of**T30**lex_item_choice**None**7**"touch">>and to look at the other cultures and absorb i#DELETE#2#n their atmosphere.
Speaking about governments' financial support of their national films, I claim, << that**T32**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>t is a must. Due to their investments local films will de<<definitely**T6**Spelling**None**10**definetely>>ecome more dazzling, exciting and interesting. People from other places al<<all over the world**T7**Absence_comp_colloc**None**13**all the world>>ill be able to expand their knowledge about th<<this particular**T33**lex_item_choice**None**11**the certain>>ountry. Furthermore, wa<<watching**T4**Spelling**None**8**wathcing>>ilms made about local places attract th#DELETE#17#ese people as a tourists, as if they can see all the be<<beauty**T36**Suffix**None**10**beautyness>>f a country, they de<<definitely**T5**Spelling**None**10**definetely>>a<<will want**T35**Tense_choice**None**4**want>>o visit it. So, it can lead to the pr<<benefit**T37**lex_item_choice**None**6**profit>>f the country's budget.
All things considered, British and American films are more per<<preferable**T3**Spelling**None**10**perferable>>cause of their professional production, exciting plots, amazing decorations, amusing costumes and famous actors. And locally produced films should be inv<<funded**T38**lex_item_choice**None**8**invested>> the governments to be at the same level with such films.
