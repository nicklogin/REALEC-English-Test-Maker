The graph <<displays**T1**lex_item_choice**None**7**reveals>> information about <<the proportions**T2**Category_confusion**None**12**proportional>> use of different <<social networks**T3**Absence_explanation**None**8**networks>> by adult users. We can see 2 main features of data.
Firstly, we can see that young people generally use <<the networks**T4**Articles**None**8**networks>> more frequently. Popularity of <<the networks**T5**Noun_number**None**7**network>> steadily decreases with age. For instance, more than a half of Instagram <<users**T6**lex_item_choice**None**8**auditory>> is under 29 years. <<On the other hand**T7**Linking_device**None**12**Nevertheless>>, LinkedIn <<does not**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**7**doesn't>> have such enormous variety as Instagram #DELETE#4#does.
Secondly, Facebook is the most popular network. <<Percentage numbers**T12**lex_item_choice**None**11**Percentages>> of Facebook users are mostly twice <<as high as**T10**Prepositional_adjective**None**11**higher than>> <<that of Instagram or LinkedIn**T11**Pronouns**None**26**Instagram or LinkedIn ones>>. Even in <<the oldest**T13**Superlative_adj**None**7**the old>> age group, more than a half of people uses Facebook.
So <<Instagram and LinkedIn have**T14**Agreement_errors**None**26**Instagram and LinkedIn has>> similar rates, which are doubled by Facebook. Also Facebook and Instagram have <<a similar age distribution**T15**Articles**None**24**similar age distribution>>, which significantly differs from <<LinkedIn's**T16**Possessive**None**9**Linked In>> #DELETE#3#one. 
These differences might be attributed to different <<purposes**T18**Noun_number**None**7**purpose>> and <<target audiences**T19**Tense_choice**None**15**target audience>>. Facebook is <<advertised**T20**lex_item_choice**None**5**posed>> as <<a network**T21**Articles**None**7**network>> for <<everybody,**T22**Punctuation**None**9**everybody>> while LinkedIn is used for employment purposes. So it is <<likely**T23**Spelling**None**6**likaly>> that <<the difference**T24**lex_item_choice**None**7**varying>> <<in percentage rates**T25**Prepositional_noun**None**16**percentage rates>> are caused by these reasons.
