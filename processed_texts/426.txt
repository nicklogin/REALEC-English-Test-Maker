It is <<common knowledge**T9**Articles**None**18**a common knowledge>> that youngsters commit today more crimes than ever before. This is a vital problem for our society and it must be solved rapidly and efficiently. In this essay I'll try to analyse the problem and propose some solutions.
The first reason for young people to become criminals is their poverty. Social division today is gross. Many families are d<<deprived of**T2**Prepositional_verb**None**13**deprived from>>the sheer necessities. Families of this sort sometimes have to steal f<<for a living**T1**Absence_comp_colloc**None**10**for living>> The s<<solution to**T3**Prepositions**None**12**solution for>>this problem is a<<social welfare programs**T17**lex_part_choice**None**23**a social help programs.>>These programs can c<<improve**T10**lex_item_choice**None**13**contribute to>>the general c<<living conditions**T11**lex_part_choice**None**19**condition of living>> However, the main drawback of this suggestion is high cost. One more reason for youngsters to commit crimes is the deficit of empathy. They cannot feel the pain of other people, cannot feel sympathy. One of ways to solve the problem is to establish some sort of "empathy hour" in either kindergarden or school. It can contribute to a proper upbringing of children - they will learn how to s<<sympathise with**T12**Prepositions**None**13**sympathise to>>others. Nevertheless, this is not the easiest way to solve the problem as it is quite complicated to c<<implement**T6**lex_item_choice**None**6**create>>
The last reason I suggest is a <<disrespect**T13**Articles**None**12**a disrespect>>or law. Young people feel to<<no**T7**Spelling**None**2**to>>b<<obligation to act**T14**Noun_inf**None**20**obligation in acting>>c<<in accordance with**T15**Category_confusion**None**12**according to>>he law because they have no respect for it. The legislative system sometimes is too complicated for them to follow. The solution is general enlightenment in the judicial sphere. People should know the basic laws of the community from the very childhood. Still, it can be very hard to explain the laws not only to yo<<the young**T16**lex_item_choice**None**10**youngsters>>ut also to professionals.
To sum it up, many solutions can be found for<<to**T17**Prepositions**None**3**for>>is problem. I suppose that the third solution is the best one because it is beneficial for everyone.
