It is considered, that the rate of young criminals has reached its peak now. Firstly, this essay will analyze the causes of this tendency and secondly, will propose some possible solutions to this problem.

To begin with, it is obvious that various kinds of mass media account for the increasing number of young culprits.The research shows that young people are particularly vulnerable and it leads to their psychological deformation as they imitate the behaviour of their favourite characters. The Internet and TV often propogate the temptuous image of criminals which is connected with a great number of merits, such as luxurious life and respect of other people. This shapes the wrong attitude of young people towards crime and its consequences and replaces the true values of humanism and hard labour. Moreover, deprived childhood and poor living conditions also contribute in the committing crimes. Young people often have limited opportunities and have to strive for any source of income to provide financial support for the family. Usually unemployment or lack of skills hinders their chances to earn for living. Consequently, this makes young people commit crimes.

Some urgent measures should be taken in order to tackle this problem. First of all, parents should eliminate any danger that comes from mass media. It is necessary to control the content of TV shows and serials and sometimes restrict the access to some sources. There are special controling programs which should be used by parents on a massive scale. What is more, it would be useful to organise special events in schools or universities in order to make young people reveal the adverse consequences of delinquent behaviour. For example, teachers can invite former criminals to share their negative experience and the outcome of committing crimes.

To sum up, the increase of crimes committed by young people is an alarming problem which requires complex measures in order to eradicate it.
