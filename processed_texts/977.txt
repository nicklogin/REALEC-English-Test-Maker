It is known that nowadays <<young people**T1**Articles**None**16**the young people>> commit <<a bigger amount of crimes than ever before**T33**Absence_explanation**None**59**the biggest amount of crimes compared to the previous times>>. There are some reasons for <<such an awful fact**T3**Articles**None**15**such awful fact>>.
First of all, <<it is**T7**lex_part_choice**None**8**there is>> <<the quick development**T12**Articles**None**19**a quick development>> of different kinds of cruel computer games. <<Using them**T4**Transitive**None**13**Using of them>> <<leads**T5**Agreement_errors**None**4**lead>> to cruelty in the minds of <<adolescents**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**9**teenagers>>. Some <<children**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**4**boys>> become crazy about killing in the virtual world. Unfortunately, some of them bring this passion to the real life. The second reason <<, in my opinion,**T14**Punctuation**None**13**in my opinion>> is <<the wide use**T16**Articles**None**10**a wide use>> of <<the Internet**T11**Articles**None**8**Internet>> by <<children**T17**Inappropriate_register**None**4**kids>>. There are some rude <<advertisements**T32**Agreement_errors**None**12**advertisment>> there which also <<have**T10**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> some influence on <<a child's mind**T18**Articles**None**16**the child's mind>>. The third one is <<lack**T19**Articles**None**6**a lack>> of control by parents, sisters, brothers <<, and**T20**Punctuation**None**3**and>> other relatives. In the previous times the system of looking for children was <<stricter**T21**Comparative_adj**None**11**more strict>>. Now they have access to everything they want because of the Internet also.
Actually, there is no doubt that adults should try to make this situation better. There are some ways #DELETE#3#how to improve it. I claim that restrictions on <<an adolescent's**T32**Inappropriate_register**None**10**teenager's>> access to the Internet will help a lot. <<Young people**T25**Articles**None**16**The young people>> should not be able to watch cruel movies and videos also. The second way to prevent <<crimes committed by youths**T27**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**crimes by youths>> is to explain them why the last ones are gruesome. The schools have to add some lessons for that, and invite psychologists in order to speak with pupils about the damage of crimes.
To sum up, the problem of <<the growing amount of crimes**T29**Articles**None**24**growing amount of crimes>> <<committed by**T32**Voice**None**9**making by>> <<adolescents**T32**Inappropriate_register**None**9**teenagers>> is very actual and is a reason for anxiety about their future. The fight with this problem is a duty of every conscious human!
