Statistics shows that proportion of crimes commited by young people is higher than the historic average rate. Clearly, something should be done to reverse this trend and decrease numbers of crimes. 
There are 2 possible approaches to tackle the problem. Young people might be influenced by parents and teachers. And both of them can induce some actions in order to protect children and teenagers from committing crimes.
Parents have the greatest influence on their child until the child goes to school. So moral and ethical norms might be created in children minds. There are a lot of books and movies that propagate honest lifestyle. Many of them are interesting for children. So parents may do a half of their job only by providing children with right fairytails and cartoons. Also parents should remove incentives to commit crimes. If a child has enough pocket money, she will not steel. If a child had been tought how to solve problems diplomatically, she wouldn't fight with other children in the future. So parents should provide children with all what they need and educate how they should behave.
Although, children who are well educated by parents are less likely to commit crimes, bad environment and spoiled classmates may force the child to do something bad. So teachers should manage the situation and work with children whose parents are not capable to educate the child properly. Also some obligatory moral classes can be imposed in regions with high crime rates.
It is likely that these private and public approaches will create synergy together and tackle the problem more effectively. A bad child who is situated in good and honest environment will rehabilitate very quickly. So I belive that after systematic implementation of suggested measures, number of teenagers' crimes will exponentially decrease.
