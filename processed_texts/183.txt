In our modern world people face the dilemma of whether to punish people who <<spend**T1**Tense_choice**None**5**spent>> their time <<copying**T2**Participial_constr**None**7**to copy>> musical <<products**T3**lex_item_choice**None**10**production>> and films, using the Internet, instead of buying legal discs. <<Let's find it out!**T4**Standard**None**18**Letâ€™s find out it!>>
First of all, some people think that it is wrong to copy because individuals who <<are fond of**T291**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**fond of>> music or making films <<spend**T5**Tense_choice**None**5**spent>> a lot of money on this thing. Such kind of people <<spends**T290**Spelling**None**6**spents>> <<their**T13**Agreement_errors**None**3**its>> free time to produce music or make a film. People just want to receive their <<profit**T8**lex_item_choice**None**3**fee>>. What is more interesting, when a person likes copying and sharing music or another object of art, he teaches his children to do it in the same way. Such children are convinced that it is normal.
<<Nevertheless**T9**Spelling**None**14**Never the less>>, other people <<claim**T294**Tense_choice**None**12**have claimed>> that it is profitable and <<convenient**T10**Spelling**None**10**convinient>> to share and copy music or films. They think that it is very <<expensive**T11**Spelling**None**9**expansive>> for common people <<to buy**T292**Infinitive_constr**None**6**buying>> the original discs. <<Besides, artists, animators and musicians very often charge high prices for their works**T12**Standard**None**93**Besides, very often artists, animators and musicians have charged high prices for their works>>. Usually, common people cannot <<afford**T14**Word_choice**None**19**allow to themselves>> to have such <<expensive**T15**Spelling**None**9**expansive>> original films or <<music**T16**Category_confusion**None**7**musical>> discs. That is why they just copy <<them**T288**Ref_device**None**2**it>>. Such people do not think that it is a crime or that they should be punished.
To sum up, I would like to say that illegal pirate copies #DELETE#2#it <<are**T290**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> not the best way of enjoying good music or films. In my opinion, copying and sharing art materials should be punished.
