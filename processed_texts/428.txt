It is a common opinion that watching <<sports**T2**Noun_number**None**5**sport>> is not worth our time, which we spend on it. This statement has both sides.

My belief is that people have to do sport, not just be fans. Firstly, it is really wasting of time to watch it, because it has emerged not as attractive performance, but as way to ke<<keep your body fit**T3**lex_part_choice**None**21**keep your body in fit>>The an<<ancient**T4**Spelling**None**7**antient>>r<<greeks**T5**Spelling**None**6**greecs>>id not di<<start celebrating**T12**lex_item_choice**None**8**discover>>he Olympic games to entertain the audience. It was the co<<competition**T14**Punctuation**None**12**competition,>>n<<which can help you to challenge and prove yourself**T15**Absence_comp_sent**None**45**in which you can prove and challenge yourself>>Secondly, pe<<people who watch sport events in real life or on TV**T28**Punctuation**None**53**people, who watch sport events in real life or on TV,>>sually are very "re<<reliable**T6**lex_item_choice**None**9**reputable>>critics. They just want their favourite team or wgatever to win. But people be<<feel**T18**lex_item_choice**None**6**become>>ery di<<disappointed**T7**Punctuation**None**13**dissapointed,>>f something goes wrong. In that case we all can give a lot of wo<<reasonable**T21**lex_item_choice**None**5**worth>>dvice while si<<sitting on**T19**Prepositions**None**10**sitting in>>he so<<sofa**T20**Spelling**None**4**sofe>>Finally, th<<the question is**T30**Punctuation**None**16**the question is,>>hy do not you do sport?

On the other hand, there are a lot of inva<<disabled**T9**lex_item_choice**None**7**invalid>>p<<people**T27**Punctuation**None**7**people,>> have no opportunity to become a word<<world-known**T31**Spelling**None**10**word-known>>rtsman or simply do it for their pleasure. Due to this fact, watching is a comp<<compromise**T34**Punctuation**None**11**compromise,>>ch can <<can bring**T10**Modals**None**10**can brings>>y to their dream a bit closer. Moreover, as it was mentioned above, sport is the cause of appe<<a myriad of fans appearing**T35**Standard**None**26**appearing a myriad of fans>>ey, of course, could do some fitness or play football or whatever. In this case, it is the part of their life, the vital one. So, impor<<someting so important**T36**Word_choice**None**10**importance>>d not be a wasting of time.

To conclude, the sport is vital p<<a vital part**T37**Articles**None**10**vital part>>ple's lifes. <<life**T38**Countable_uncountable**None**5**lifes>>ves us a lot of opportunities and improves our phisica<<physical**T39**Spelling**None**8**phisical>>ral health. But the main problem is to manage <<combine**T40**lex_item_choice**None**6**manage>>w watching and doing, because if we split them up, sport will continue to be a vital part, howev<< but**T44**Linking_device**None**9**, however>>ng may be the cause of a planty <<plenty**T44**Spelling**None**6**planty>>erse problems.
