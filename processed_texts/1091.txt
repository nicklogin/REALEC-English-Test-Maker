The most popular social network in the United States is Facebook. Almost 90 percent of young (18 – 29 y.o.) people use it. In other groups this figure is smaller, but even in the oldest group (65+) Facebook is used by more than a half of people.
Instagram is less popular than Facebook. It is used by 53% of young people, but among elder people this social network is drastically less popular. Only one fourth of 30-49 <<year-old**T3**Derivation**None**8**year old>> people are active users of Instagram. This proportion reaches <<its**T4**Pronouns**None**4**it’s>> bottom among 65+ y.o. people. Only 6% of them have an Instagram account.
