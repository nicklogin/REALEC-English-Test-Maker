The “Guaranteed Basic Income” system that has been put forward by some governments and politicians clearly has a number of advantages and disadvantages to be considered and taken into account. While the idea of such a system suggests nothing but positive effects on citizens, there can be a few not as obvious drawbacks that are worth being mentioned.
It goes without any doubt that the system can have a<<positive influence**T1**Countable_uncountable**None**20**a positive influence>>on people and the whole society itself. I will take under consideration a few of t<<advantages**T2**Ref_device**None**4**them>>which seem to be the most significant to me. Firstly, it could provide citizens with a chance to start saving money for things they were not able to afford before. For instance, college for their children, a new house or their own business. Secondly, as this system represents a guaranteed source of income, people will not be afraid to quit the job they do not like in order to find a new one or move to another city and start a new life.
At the same time, there are some disadvantages to be listed as well. In my opinion, this idea sounds good in theory, but not in practice. Where do politicians plan to get money from? The only answer I can come up with is them rising taxes. And if it will be this way, what is the point in introducing the idea? What is more, it could be assumed that many people might want to leave their job as they will be satisfied with the amount of money they will be provided.
In conclusion, pros and cons of a “<<the “Guaranteed Basic Income” system**T4**Articles**None**34**a “Guaranteed Basic Income” system>>e quite evident. In my opinion, its benefits will not outweigh the drawbacks as I consider possible disadvantages to be of high importance.
