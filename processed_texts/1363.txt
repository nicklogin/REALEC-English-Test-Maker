The charts provide <<the information**T1**Articles**None**11**information>> on <<the transportation**T2**Articles**None**14**transportation>> of various <<goods**T3**lex_item_choice**None**6**things>> between Eastern Europe countries by rail and by road in 2008.

It can be clearly seen from the charts that the percentage of manufactured goods transported by rail and by road is almost equal (a quarter). However, the highest percentage in the first chart has metals, whereas in the second one food products are the leader.

Looking at the charts, <<it is obvious**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**it obvious>> that the <<proportions**T5**Noun_number**Dependent_change**10**proportion>> of machinery transported by road and rail <<are**T6**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> very different, since for the <<first chart**T9**lex_item_choice**None**6**former>> it is only 2%<< which**T7**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> is the least of <<all goods**T8**Absence_explanation**None**3**all>> while for the <<second chart**T10**lex_item_choice**None**5**later>> it is 12%. There is also a big difference in the quantity of <<the metals transportations**T11**Determiners**None**22**metals transportations>>, as <<it**T12**Ref_device**None**4**they>> takes the biggest part in the first chart (35%) and almost <<The smallest one**T17**Absence_comp_colloc**None**9**the least>> in the second one (11%). The <<proportions**T15**Noun_number**Dependent_change**10**proportion>> of chemicals transported by both rail and road <<are**T16**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> almost the same, with <<the difference**T17**Determiners**None**12**a difference>> in 5% only.
