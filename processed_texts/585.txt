The table illustrates the mean amount of time people in the UK spent doing sport and exercise.
The main outstanding feature that we first notice is that men, aged 16-24, spend about 282,1 minutes on practicing sport, while women from the same age group spend o<<only**T219**Spelling**None**5**opnly>>114,1 minutes on exercising. This can implicate that young men are more aware of their body image than women. They spend more time taking care of it and therefore they might be more healthy.
If we take a look at the whole chart, we can see that throughout every age group there is one big similarity: men spend more time on sport than women. However, this tendency breaks in the 55-64 age group, where women spend 55,4 minutes on doing exercises, whereas men spend only 52,7 minutes.
Overall, the graph demonstrates the meaning of sport for men and women. Men tend to look after their bodies more thoroughly, while women do not have time to exercise all the time. However, that does not mean that women are less healthy. They can stay healthy using other methods, for example - eating healthy food.
