<<An issue of making and spreading pirate copies of films and music**T1**Absence_explanation**None**10**This issue>> is <<a vital part**T2**Articles**None**14**the vital part>> of <<modern life**T3**Articles**None**15**the modern life>>. Although many people <<prefer**T4**Spelling**None**7**prefere>> to <<download**T7**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**16**copy or to share>> music and films <<from**T8**Prepositions**Dependent_change**2**on>> the internet instead of buying <<them**T5**Agreement_errors**None**3**its>>, the cost of <<it**T6**Often_confused**None**4**this>> has to be considered first.
Many people support the opinion that it is <<a very bad situation**T9**Articles**None**18**very bad situation>>, <<when**T10**lex_item_choice**None**4**that>> all people have a free <<access to**T11**Prepositional_noun**None**10**access for>> different sources <<on**T12**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the internet. Firstly, musicians and film producers, who make <<an effort**T14**Noun_number**None**7**efforts>> #DELETE#3#for to do music or film, should get <<goods**T36**Articles**None**9**the goods>> for <<their**T15**Agreement_errors**None**3**its>> <<work**T16**Noun_number**None**5**works>>. It could be illustrated by the following example: a producer <<makes**T17**Agreement_errors**None**4**make>> a film and he <<wishes**T19**Agreement_errors**None**4**wish>> <<to be**T18**lex_item_choice**None**5**he is>> respected <<, and**T20**Punctuation**None**3**and>> he <<wants**T21**Agreement_errors**None**4**want>> to <<get**T22**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> money for his #DELETE#4#hurt job, but people don’t want to buy <<discs**T24**Noun_number**None**8**the disc>> with his film, they <<copy**T25**Tense_choice**None**7**copying>> it <<from**T26**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the internet. <<As a result,**T56**Punctuation**None**11**As a result>> a producer <<loses**T29**Agreement_errors**None**4**lose>> money. Secondly, producing and making music are the #DELETE#20#work and its work is same as other jobs. For instance, if <<economists**T31**Noun_number**None**12**an economist>> or <<people who sit at the governmental office**T34**Defining**None**45**people, who sitsit at the governmental office>> have <<goods**T35**Articles**None**9**the goods>> for <<their jobs**T37**Absence_explanation**None**4**jobs>>, musicians, producers <<and other people of art**T38**Absence_explanation**None**6**artist>> should also get money.
However, some people think that it is <<a normal situation**T40**Articles**None**16**normal situation>> in <<modern life**T41**Articles**None**15**the modern life>> <<, and**T42**Punctuation**None**3**and>> musicians and film producers should understand<< that**T43**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they can’t <<avoid**T44**lex_item_choice**None**5**evide>> <<losing**T45**Spelling**None**7**loosing>> goods. Moreover, it isn’t right to punish such people <<, because**T46**Punctuation**None**7**because>> they act rationally, when they don’t want to buy #DELETE#8#for free music and films.
Having considered both sides of this debate, it can be concluded that it is <<a widespead situation**T48**Articles**None**20**widespread situation>> in the modern world, when people share or copy films or music, but we should think about musicians and film producers, who lose <<huge amounts of money**T50**Absence_explanation**None**10**huge money>> <<, and**T51**Punctuation**None**3**and>> we should solve this issue. <<Personally,**T52**Punctuation**None**10**Personally>> I would agree with the idea that we should destroy the process of making illegal pirate copies, because it <<harms**T53**lex_item_choice**None**15**make a harm for>> <<people who make art and want to get money and respect for their efforts**T54**Defining**None**72**people, who make art and want to get money and respect for their efforts>>.
