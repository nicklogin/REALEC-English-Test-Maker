Our modern world develops rapidly, that is why we can see the widespread use of modern <<technology**T1**Spelling**None**9**techology>> all over the world. And sometimes it <<causes**T2**Tense_choice**None**10**is causing>> problems with health.
One of the biggest <<problems**T3**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> for our health is that modern technologies make our life easier and <<simpler**T4**Comparative_adj**None**11**more simple>>, that is why people started to have less activity. <<For example,**T5**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> if we want to meet our friends and speak with them, just for <<fun**T6**Spelling**None**3**fan>>, we will call them by phone or skype or something like that. But we lose the opportunity to go for a walk with them. Moreover, modern technologies <<allowed**T7**Spelling**None**6**allwed>> us to sit on one place and do everything we want or we need. <<For this reason**T8**lex_part_choice**None**16**With this reason>>, people become lazy, and fat. <<These arguments provide people's illnesses, for example, overweight.**T9**Abs_comp_clause**None**68**These arguments provide people's illnesses. for example, overweight.>> This kind of illness makes people very <<inactive**T11**Prefix**None**8**unactive>>.
Another health problem which is the result of influence of modern technologies is a problem with <<eyes**T12**Spelling**None**5**eyers>>. People <<started to watch**T13**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**13**started watch>> their <<phones**T14**Spelling**None**6**phomes>>, TV's, computers too much.
But with the help of modern technologies, people can solve these problems with health. Technologies develop in <<the medicine sphere**T18**Articles**None**15**medicine sphere>>, that is why people started to live longer and happier. Nowadays, there are a lot of hospitals all over the world which can help with overweight or with <<eye problems**T19**Noun_attribute**None**14**problem's eyes>> and so on.
In conclusion, <<widespread modern technologies have**T15**Category_confusion**None**37**widespread of modern technologies has>> more positive effect than negative. <<I consider that**T16**Spelling**None**16**I consider, that>> in the nearest future technologies will give us an opportunity to solve all our problems with health and people <<will start**T17**Tense_choice**None**5**start>> to live more than 150 years.
