Average temperatures in Rio de Janeiro and Yakutsk differ significantly over the course of a year; while <<the graph**T217**Articles**None**5**graph>> representing Rio looks almost like a straight line, with <<the maximum temperature**T218**Articles**None**19**maximum temperature>> bouncing between 20 and 30 C and <<the minimum temperature**T219**Articles**None**19**minimum temperature>> somewhere between 18 and 24 C respectively, <<the second graph**T220**Articles**None**12**second graph>> resembles a parabola function, reaching its peak in July at 23 C and then dropping below -40 C during <<the winter season**T225**Articles**None**13**winter season>>. As for comparison, <<they do not have much in common**T226**lex_part_choice**None**40**there is not much in common between them>>. The gap between their temperatures in winter is absurdly huge, reaching 70 C in <<the worst cases**T221**Articles**None**11**worst cases>>, but strangely the temperature in Rio seems to fall a bit in summer, so it sometimes can happen that <<the temperature**T222**Articles**None**11**temperature>> in Yakutsk gets higher, than in Rio. As it <<has already been stated**T223**Tense_choice**None**23**had already been stated>>, <<the temperature**T227**Articles**None**11**temperature>> in Rio rises during January and February, and falls off during <<the summer**T228**Articles**None**6**summer>>, which is a result of climatic and geographic features of <<the city**T224**Articles**None**6**a city>>, while <<the temperature**T229**Articles**None**11**temperature>> in Yakutsk changes the other way around, reaching its peak in mid-summer<<. In**T230**Spelling**None**3**.In>> addition to that, it can also be noticed that the difference between the maximum and minimum graph in Rio is bigger and more unstable, than the difference in Yakutsk.
