It is argued that <<the increasing interest**T2**Articles**None**27**an ever increasing interest>> in technologies has an adverse influence on <<people's**T3**Possessive**None**6**people>> physical condition. This essay will firstly <<explicit**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**suggest>> spine-related problems as the main issue and <<, secondly,**T5**Punctuation**None**9**secondly,>> <<it will outline**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**outline>> the construction of new sport facilities as one of <<the possible solutions**T7**Articles**None**18**possible solutions>>. 

To begin with, <<the overuse**T8**Articles**None**7**overuse>> of modern gadgets <<causes**T9**Tense_choice**None**11**have caused>> numerous problems for people’s health, such as poor <<eyesight**T10**Spelling**None**7**eyesite>>, gaining #DELETE#2#of some extra weight. However, the problems connected with the back are the most dangerous. Sitting long hours in one position in front of the screen weakens and practically curves our spine. <<Though,**T12**Punctuation**None**6**Though>> <<these**T13**Ref_device**None**4**this>> changes might not cause pain, <<, but they can**T14**Linking_device**None**8**they can>> result in serious damage to <<one's**T15**Possessive**None**4**ones>> organism. For example, doctors discovered that sitting in one pose more than for 4 hours a day might lead to the carious problems with spine, which <<affect**T16**Spelling**None**7**offects>> all #DELETE#9#the human organism unfavorably. 

Nevertheless, <<the number**T18**Articles**None**8**a number>> of measures can be taken to eliminate negative <<effects of**T19**Prepositions**None**7**effects>> modern devices #DELETE#4#have on our back and health in general. Creating the additional sport centers is the foremost solution to this problem. Considering that a lot of people refuse <<doing**T21**lex_item_choice**None**9**going for>> sports<< due**T22**Spelling**None**5**, due>> to the lack of available facilities, building new sport centers will <<encourage them to do sport activities**T23**Absence_explanation**None**14**encourage them>>. <<The**T24**Spelling**None**4**This>> government might implement special programs in order to increase the number of sport facilities. For instance, the initiative called “Sports for everyone” was created <<to**T25**Prepositions**None**3**for>> enhance sport infrastructure of our country, developing new objects for doing sports. <<It**T26**Ref_device**None**4**This>> resulted in <<the rising numner**T27**Articles**None**15**a rising number>> of  children choosing <<an active way**T28**Articles**None**10**active way>> of life over <<modern devices**T29**Articles**None**18**the modern devices>>. 

To sum up, technologies indeed <<affect people's health condition badly**T31**Standard**None**38**affect badly people's health condition>>, causing different problems, especially problems with spine. However, governments launch various programs to solve this problem and to help people to develop physically.
