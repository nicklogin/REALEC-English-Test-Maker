Nowadays the problem of pirate content is very widespread. Some people believe that it is important only to <<buy**T1**Spelling**None**2**by>> such content <<, especially**T2**Punctuation**None**10**especially>> if this content is associated with musicians and film producers. The others prefer to use pirate copies. So, there are various <<opinions**T3**Noun_number**None**7**opinion>> <<of**T4**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the point. I completely agree with <<the idea**T5**Articles**None**4**idea>> that everybody should pay for other menâ€™s labor, so the government should punish people who make pirate copies and #DELETE#3#who spread it. It can be proved by some arguments.
To begin with, all money <<that**T7**lex_item_choice**None**5**which>> musicians and producers <<do not get**T8**lex_item_choice**None**11**are not get>> <<because of**T9**Prepositions**None**4**from>> pirate copies may be <<lent**T10**Spelling**None**5**leant>> to developing their industry and making new unique art smashing content. <<A leak**T12**Articles**None**8**The leak>> of resourses sometimes slows down <<a process**T11**Articles**None**7**process>> of making it.
<<Moreover**T13**Linking_device**None**4**Then>>, using illegal pirate copies is <<equal to**T15**Prepositions**None**10**equal with>> stealing goods. Modern governments usually punish robbers, that is why, this rule should <<include**T17**lex_item_choice**None**12**be spread to>> such content.
Finally, <<a ban**T18**Articles**None**7**the ban>> of using illegal copies will <<reduce**T19**lex_item_choice**None**8**dicrease>> a shadow sector of an economy of a country. It will lead to <<a growth**T20**Category_confusion**None**7**growing>> of <<cash flow**T34**Spelling**None**11**a cash flow>> to dealers too.
So many men, so many minds. We <<cannot**T23**Spelling**None**7**can not>> say that this or that opinion is wrong. But in this particular case a punishment <<of**T24**Prepositions**None**3**for>> spreaders and users of illegal content will bring to life a lot of positive results<<,**T25**Punctuation**None**1**.>> <<that**T26**lex_item_choice**None**5**which>> #DELETE#3#one <<can include**T28**lex_item_choice**None**15**associated with>> clearing an economy, growing benefits for dealers and increasing #DELETE#2#of <<a level of motivation**T34**Articles**None**16**motivation level>> among musicians and film producers. The government may establish low <<prices**T32**Noun_number**None**5**price>> for such content to make it available for #DELETE#3#big masses of people.
