The two pie charts given demonstrate the two means of transport by which various goods in Eastern Europe were transported in 2008: trains and trucks.
The data a<<is**T1**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>>provided in persents.

It can be deduced from the charts that many types of goods were transported by rail as successfully as by roads in 2008.
Namely, the amount of chemicals delivered by trains was only 5% lower than one by trucks: 11% and 16% respectively. Similarly, 25% of mani<<manufactured**T2**Spelling**None**12**manifactured>>ds were transported with the help of trains and 28% - by road.
But the differences also exist. For example, six-time more machinery was transported by rail: it was 12% when only 2% are delivered by road.
Trains were also more preferable for transporting metals: approximately three-time more metals were transported by them - 35%, when only 11% were moved with the help of trucks.In contrast, three-time more food products were transported by roads then by trains: 30% and 11% respectively. Speaking about non-me<<non-metallic**T3**Spelling**None**11**non-metalic>>als,it can also be noticed, that they were moved more often with the help of trucks than with the help of trains.

Overall, after analyzing the information provided, it can be stated that these two means of transportation are equally popular, but for some type of good one semms to<<seems**T4**Spelling**None**5**semms>>ore beneficial than the other.
