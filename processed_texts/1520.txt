Nowadays the problem of usage of illegal drugs in sport is extremely acute, especially because the cult of sport is becoming more and more popular. Some humans believe that sportsmen using such drugs must be abandoned from professional competitions for some restricted period of time. However, other people offer to ban athletes forever.
Turning to the first point of view, it must be said that everyone can make a mistake, so it is rather fair to limit period without contests not for a long time. First of all, there are some cases when caught sportsmen even do not know about illegal drugs in their products: food and drink. It may be the opponent who cheated athlete and then told jury about it. If it is a well-organised crime, nobody will catch the criminal and instead of him this sportsman will be blamed. Such precedents are mostly widespread in big competitions such as Olympic games. Secondly, athlete may use illegal drugs if he is not ready to contests. Hence, it is important to remove him from competition and give him certain time, a year or some years, to keep himself in fit and compete with other candidates, without dopping.
However, some sport fans and organisators take care of the culture of sport with incredible love and tenderness. Consequently, for such people the usage of illegal drugs is the worst crime which deserves the strongest measures, because sportsmen who commit the crime, understand what they do: all depends on fortune. Nonetheless, athletes who do not respect sport and its principles cannot be called as sportsmen. 
To sum up, I want to say that despite the existence of these two radical opinions, I firmly adhere to the first one. I understand people who use illegal drugs, though I do not appreciate it: undoubtedly, sportsmen have a panic before the contests, they have to represent the whole country and all these factors lead to dopping in the final stage. Nevertheless, it is not the worthy reason to betray sport rules.
