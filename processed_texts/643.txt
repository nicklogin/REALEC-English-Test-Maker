This graph reflects temperature progress during the whole year (from January to December)in two cities - Yakutsk in Russia and Rio de Jeaneiro in Brazil.

Regarding the highest level of te<<temperature**T393**Spelling**None**11**tempereture>>we can see that the temperature in Rio de Janeiro reaches its peak of 30 degrees above zero in January. Maximum temperature curve then di<<dips**T394**Spelling**None**5**dipps>>lightly to approximately 25 degrees in May, fluctuating during further 4 months just around 25 degrees (from May to September). Temperature rate rises steadily during 4 months till the end of the year, returning to its initial level of just around 30 degrees. Maximum temperature rate in Yakutsk starts with around 35 degrees below zero at the beginning of the year, increasing gradually to its highest level of around 25 degrees above zero in July, which is the warmest month of a year. Temperature curve declines during all 6 months left, falling down from plus 25 degrees to almost 35 degrees below zero.

Turning to the minimum temperature figures, we can noti<<notice**T395**Punctuation**None**7**notice,>>t the curve follows the same pattern in both cases, copying maximum rank curve's principle. While looking at the Rio's curve, it should be said<<said**T396**Punctuation**None**5**said,>>t the gap between maximum and minimum figures remains almost the same, having approximately 7 degrees distance. The highest minimum temperature is seen in February (just above plus 25 degrees), while the lowest is detected in July (around 17 degrees respectively).Yakutsk's minimum temperature line follows the same pattern as in the previous case: temperature rank plummets steadily from minus 40 degrees in January to just above plus 10 degrees in July, dipping to the initial level of 40 degrees below zero in December.

In summary, it can be conclu<<concluded**T397**Punctuation**None**10**concluded,>>average temperature progress in Rio (Brazil) differs from Yakutsk's progress greately. Rio's temperature curve roughly remains at the same level during the whole year, fluctuating from 30 to 25 degrees of the maximum level and from 25 to 17 degrees of the minimum level respek<<respectively**T398**Spelling**None**12**respektively>>sk's temperature curve has a marked peak both by the maximum and minimum temperature level in July.
