These 2 pie charts show us information about goods transported by rail and by road in 2008. And the results <<, on the one hand,**T1**Punctuation**None**16**on the one  hand>> are very similar, but <<, on the other hand,**T2**Punctuation**None**17**on the other hand>> have a lot of differences.

In <<the first diagram**T4**Articles**None**13**first diagram>>, which shows us <<the results**T5**Articles**None**7**results>> of <<transported**T6**Category_confusion**None**12**transporting>> goods by rail, we can see that the most popular thing is metals, but <<in the second pie chart**T7**Articles**None**19**on second pie chart>> we can see that the most popular part is food <<products**T8**Noun_number**None**7**product>>. <<Also,**T9**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> if we look at <<the two**T10**Articles**None**1**2>> of them, <<we will**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**5**weâ€™ll>> understand that one part of all amount of goods is nearly the same, it is manufactured goods. In <<the first diagram**T12**Articles**None**13**first diagram>> it is 25 per cent and in <<the second one**T24**Absence_explanation**None**6**second>> only <<on**T15**Prepositions**None**2**in>> three per cent bigger. However, there are many <<differences**T16**Spelling**None**9**diferents>>. It <<the first pie chart**T17**Articles**None**15**first pie chart>> we can see that machinery <<has**T18**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> 12% of all amount, but in <<the second diagram**T19**Articles**None**14**second diagram>> it <<has**T20**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> the smallest one, only 2%. 

To sum up, there are <<a lot of**T21**Inappropriate_register**None**4**lots>> of <<differences**T22**Spelling**None**12**differenties>> in <<the ways**T23**Articles**None**4**ways>> of transporting <<the goods**T24**Articles**None**5**goods>>.
