The <<problems**T63**Noun_number**Dependent_change**7**Problem>> of need <<of**T14**Prepositions**None**2**in>> foreign food supplies and lack of native <<produce**T15**Often_confused**None**10**production>> <<are being faced**T64**Tense_choice**None**9**are faced>> among <<a vast range**T10**Articles**None**10**vast range>> of countries nowadays. Some people <<support**T3**Agreement_errors**None**8**supports>> the idea of narrowing down the <<amount**T4**Spelling**None**7**ammount>> of <<produce**T16**Often_confused**Dependent_change**8**products>> that <<is**T17**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**are>> imported and <<manufacturing**T5**Spelling**None**13**manifucturing>> local food for citizens of this <<certain**T6**Spelling**None**7**curtain>> country. Meanwhile, there are some major drawbacks <<to**T18**Prepositions**None**2**of>> this belief.
<<On the one hand**T19**Absence_comp_colloc**None**11**On one hand>>, the <<elimination**T20**Category_confusion**None**11**eliminating>> of food that <<was**T21**Agreement_errors**None**4**were>> imported may <<result**T22**Inappropriate_register**None**6**end up>> in the lack of variety to choose from for customers in shops and malls. But it does not mean that <<the consumer**T63**lex_item_choice**None**5**buyer>> would not be able to find a replica <<of**T25**Prepositions**None**3**for>> some kinds of food. For example, if <<a country**T26**Articles**None**7**country>> wants to narrow down the quantity of sugar, <<salt**T7**Spelling**None**4**solt>> and apples that are brought to this country in order to help local production, a customer <<will probably**T27**Standard**None**13**probably will>> not even notice this fact.
On the other hand, there are still some products<< that**T28**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<cannot**T29**Spelling**None**7**can not>> be produced in all countries <<, such as**T30**Punctuation**None**7**such as>> fresh ocean fish, Asian rice, and some sorts of <<Japanese**T12**Spelling**None**9**Japanaese>> meat, but can be easily imported and become <<irreplaceable**T31**Spelling**None**12**irreplaceble>> in everyday routine. In <<these**T32**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> cases <<the government**T33**Articles**None**10**government>> could <<do two things: establish**T35**Verb_Bare_Inf**None**24**do two things: establish>> a new production area or #DELETE#2#do import. <<It is known that**T63**Punctuation**None**22**Knowing the fact that,>> <<it is easier and cheaper for a country**T40**Standard**None**38**for a country it is easier and cheaper>> to import <<rather than**T42**Comparative_constr**None**4**than>> <<to manufacture**T63**Infinitive_constr**None**13**manifucturing>> <<these products**T43**Ref_device**None**2**it>>.
However, <<even though**T11**Spelling**None**10**eventhough>> most products can be produced at local <<farms**T44**Noun_number**None**4**farm>> and factories, there are some types of food that <<have**T45**Tense_choice**None**3**had>> to be imported because of <<a vast range**T46**Articles**None**10**vast range>> of reasons. The most common is that <<, due to**T63**Punctuation**None**3**for>> <<the country's low consumption rate of such products,**T50**Standard**None**55**the country's consumption rate of such products are low>> <<it is**T63**lex_item_choice**None**4**does>> not worth the money it takes to produce <<them**T55**Ref_device**None**2**it>>. In addition, the local production may not benefit and <<might**T56**Modals**None**4**will>> <<go bankrupt**T57**Inappropriate_register**None**8**be broke>> in a few years.
To sum up, the <<elimination**T58**Category_confusion**None**11**eliminating>> of import and <<the production**T63**Articles**None**9**producing>> <<of everything**T63**Prepositions**None**8**evething>> inside one country in order to feed citizens is <<a controversial issue**T62**Articles**None**19**controversial issue>> that needs clever solutions from <<the government**T63**Articles**None**10**government>>.
