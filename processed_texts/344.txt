As we all know, our world is not <<safe**T1**Often_confused**None**5**saved>>, we <<often**T26**Word_choice**None**3**can>> face many bad things and ,<<which**T2**Ref_device**None**4**what>> is worse, bad attitude among <<people**T17**Articles**None**10**the people>>, <<and that causes crimes**T18**Word_choice**None**26**so that it all makes crime>>, which will never <<vanish**T3**Voice**None**11**be vanished>>. Nowadays it is believed<< that**T4**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> crime is <<committed**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**done>> by young generation, not by <<elderly**T19**Suffix**None**5**elder>> people.
Firstly, I would like to mention that today r<<rather a big amount**T6**Articles**None**17**rather big amount>>of young people do not study as well, they have no motivation to study, to learn something new and b<<because of this**T28**lex_part_choice**None**11**by this way>>t<<they**T7**Spelling**None**3**the>>are not able to find y<<their vocation**T8**lex_part_choice**None**8**yourself>> As a result, it becomes n<<necessary**T9**Category_confusion**None**9**necessity>>to get m<<something to live on**T29**Absence_explanation**None**4**more>>by the easiest way. For instance, they can d<<start**T30**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>>b<<committing burglaries**T31**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**burgling>> pickpocketing and other bad things.
It is<<needs**T10**Voice**None**9**is needed>>o be controlled in pr<<a proper way**T11**Articles**None**10**proper way>>For example, some parents AR<<are**T32**Capitalisation**None**3**ARE>>he source of this problem. Wh<<What is worse,**T12**Comparative_adj**None**17**What is the worst>>hat they do not gr<<raise**T34**Often_confused**None**4**grow>>heir children up in pr<<a proper way**T13**Articles**None**10**proper way>>they ca<<cannot**T35**Spelling**None**7**can not>>ontrol them. Children always need some attention, even the sm<<smallest ones**T36**Ref_device**None**8**smallest>>They need it so much that they can behave like this to get some attention from their parents a bit .Moreover, th<<teachers**T37**Articles**None**12**the teachers>>hould motivate th<<the young**T38**Category_confusion**None**9**the youth>>ma<<make children hear them**T20**Verb_object_bare**None**26**make children to hear them>>because teachers are mentors! I strongly believe, << that**T14**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>ttitude and relationships between teachers and pupils should be changed, particularly in Russia. Teachers in Russia are ac<<not accepted as students' friends**T21**Absence_explanation**None**17**accept as a minor>>that is why pupils are afraid of them and even can not talk about something after school time. Furthermore, the youth behave this way because of la<<the lack**T22**Articles**None**4**lack>>f so<<any**T40**Quantifiers**None**4**some>>nterests. It means, << that**T15**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>hey should find something that will give them positive feelings, something that can un<<stimulate**T41**lex_item_choice**None**8**unburden>>he interest. I do believe, << that**T16**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>port can solve this problem, because when you do this you are focused only on this deal and can relax and get rid of bad things fr<<on**T43**Prepositions**None**4**from>>our mind.
To sum up, I would like to add, t<< that**T44**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>tually all these bad things depend on a person. Some people have str<<a strong spirit**T23**Articles**None**13**strong spirit>>he<<a feeling of honesty**T24**Articles**None**22**the feeling of honesty>>d<<, and**T45**Punctuation**None**3**and>>e<<this help them to fight with temptations**T25**Absence_explanation**None**23**they fight with it well>>
