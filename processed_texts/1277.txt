The pie charts #DELETE#5#below provide the data <<on**T1**Prepositions**None**5**about>> the goods transported across the countries in the year 2008. The first chart gives <<information**T12**Articles**None**15**the information>> about <<railroad**T13**Compound_word**None**9**rail road>> transportation, while the second one gives details on road transportation. #DELETE#8#Overall, <<Most**T10**Capitalisation**None**4**most>> of the goods can be transported by <<either of the two**T11**Determiners**None**4**both>> ways. 

Firstly, metals <<were**T8**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> transported more often by rail than by road, while non-metallic minerals <<were**T9**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> <<twice as often**T16**Numerical**None**16**twice more often>> transported by road. Manufactured goods <<showed**T19**Tense_choice**None**6**follow>> the <<following**T26**Absence_explanation**Dependent_change**4**same>> pattern in rail and road transportation: 25 % and 28 % <<respectively**T14**lex_item_choice**None**10**apparently>>. Secondly, one third of <<the total amount transported by rail**T20**Absence_explanation**None**20**rail transportations>> <<were**T6**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> #DELETE#8#taken by <<food products**T23**Absence_explanation**None**4**food>>. Roads <<were**T15**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> not usually used to transport machinery. Such transportations <<made up**T19**Tense_choice**None**4**take>> 12%  of rail transportations. 

All in all, some goods <<were**T4**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> transported only by road <<or**T24**Linking_device**None**3**and>> rail, while others <<kept up**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**take>> <<equal**T18**lex_item_choice**None**8**the same>> <<percentage**T19**lex_item_choice**None**10**proportion>> of rail and road transportations.
