Musical and film industry <<loses**T5**Agreement_errors**None**4**lose>> a <<lot**T6**Noun_number**None**4**lots>> of money in <<modern times**T7**Articles**None**14**a modern times>> because of illegal copies and “pirates” attacks. The problem is that people nowadays <<prefer to download**T8**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**15**prefer download>> some films and music albums from <<Internet**T4**Capitalisation**None**12**the Internet>>. As a result, musicians and film producers lose their money, because none of people <<wants**T11**Agreement_errors**None**4**want>> to buy their works.
As for me, I agree with this point of view. And I also will try to prove it. The first thing is<< that**T12**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> musicians and film producers waste their time and nerves while <<makeing**T13**Spelling**None**7**makeing>> something new. A lot of my friends are musicians and they say that it is realy hard to record something good without having enough <<money**T14**Spelling**None**5**maney>>. Imagine how <<expensive**T15**lex_item_choice**None**8**wasteful>> the film is: operators work, paying to actors etc. Pirate copies make musicians and film producers less motivated, because in the end they get almost no money for their work. The second thing is<< that**T16**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> every musician <<needs**T17**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> money. It is well known fact that domestic recordings are not so good. Recording in a studio costs a lot of money; the same thing with mastering a composition or song. Musicians hope that they will sell their recording <<, for examples,**T18**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> in <<iTunes**T19**Spelling**None**7**i-tunes>> and earn some money to make new music and new albums. This second fact shows that music industry is too <<expensive**T22**lex_item_choice**None**8**wasteful>> <<, like cinema,**T21**Punctuation**None**11**like cinema>> <<, and**T20**Punctuation**None**3**and>> pirate copies destroy the enthusiasm of musician. The last fact about such topic is that concerts don’t give enough money to cover all <<spending**T4**Gerund_phrase**None**8**wastings>>. We can say that cinema industry has the same problems too.
But some people say that they don’t need money to produce something new. <<For example,**T25**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> in underground culture money don’t play an important role. The concept of underground may seem strange. Films and music contains strong language and forbidden topics. It is clear that people won’t pay any money for that. Pirate copies are not forbidden in underground; <<conversely**T4**Category_confusion**None**7**reverse>>, this culture <<adores**T28**Agreement_errors**None**5**adore>> this. Illegal copies make free <<advertising**T29**Often_confused**None**12**advertisment>> for some musicians.
To sum up, I would like to say that <<illegal copies influence film producers and muicians really badly**T35**Standard**None**66**illegal copies influencebadly on film producers and some musicians>> because as we can know from above <<, these two industries need a lot of money**T31**Punctuation**None**40**these two industries need a lot of money>>. But for others, pirate copies <<seem**T32**Agreement_errors**None**5**seems>> so good. It’s their point of view. As for me, (as I said before) illegal copies will be always <<a bad thing**T1**Articles**None**9**bad thing>> <<on the Internet**T2**Prepositions**None**11**in Internet>>.
