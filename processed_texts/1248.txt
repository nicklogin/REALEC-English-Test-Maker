It is generally considered that the development of modern technology can lead towards the threat of <<people's health**T1**Possessive**None**13**people health>>. This essay agrees that the breakthrough in modern technology might <<influence**T2**Transitive**None**12**influence on>> human beings. Firstly, the essay will discuss some possible health problems, followed by <<the suggestion**T3**Articles**None**10**suggestion>> of some issues<< which can help to reduce the harm influence**T4**Defining**None**45**, which can help to reduce the harm influence>>.

Moreover, the development of URV â€“ technologies leads towards the increase of the number of people with cancer diseases. 

In order to reduce <<the harmful influence**T8**Articles**None**17**harmful influence>> of technologies the government should enforce the restrictions on some products development and control the contemporary projects. For instance, the further improvement if URV-technologies might become a cause of new types of illnesses, therefore the government should provide severe control on these projects. 

In conclusion, the advances in technology projects can provide the <<improvements**T9**Noun_number**None**11**improvement>> of living conditions as well as lead towards <<the threats**T10**Articles**None**7**threats>> for human beings.
