As many people think that spending money on the space program is just a waste of money, I can agree with them. <<In my personal opinion,**T1**Punctuation**None**22**In my personal opinion>> we have to explore space.
F<<First of all,**T2**Punctuation**None**12**First of all>>we always can find something interesting and useful in space. F<<For example,**T3**Punctuation**None**11**For example>>n<<the**T4**Spelling**None**2**ne>>place for living or some new resources. Who knows, maybe we will be able to find a new type of fuel while exploring space. t<<That**T5**Capitalisation**None**4**that>>will not only help people to save money, but maybe it also will help to save the planet.
Secondly, as we know that if a country go<<has got**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**got>>h<<a**T7**Articles**None**3**the>>reat space program, it also has a great military program. By exploring new types of space shuttles scientists also learn something about engines and so on. That's very useful in rocket pressing or in some more peaceful way, planes manufacture.
The reason why some people think that exploring space is a waste of money is that the government can spend those money for something more useful for people. For example, pov<<for poverty or environmental issues**T8**Absence_comp_sent**None**31**poverty or environmental issues>>nd<<And**T9**Capitalisation**None**3**and>>ybe they are right in some case, but let<<let's**T10**Spelling**None**4**lets>>ink about it in another case. Lots of problems can be solved without government help. Whe#DELETE#4#n space program is unreal without government assistance. People can try to change world for themselves. For example, joining or creating societies to help our planet or homeless people. That may solve some urgent problems.
That is why I think that governments have to spend money on space exploring, because only government can help science to do even<<at least**T13**lex_item_choice**None**4**even>>ething in the space program.
