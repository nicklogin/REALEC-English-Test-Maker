The number of teenagers who take part in crimes is getting bigger every year. In this essay I am going to write about the most <<significant**T16**lex_item_choice**None**8**powerful>> causes and try to <<make some suggestions on**T377**Prepositions**None**21**make some suggestions>> how to deal with this problem.
First of all, the biggest problem is that children have bad influence from TV shows, computer games and social networks. There a<<is**T379**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>>a great number of online and computer games,<< where you have to rob banks and kill people**T381**Defining**None**45**, where you have to rob banks and kill people>> T<<Teenagers think that crimes are a good way to make money**T385**Standard**None**64**Teenagers think that it are a good way to make money with crimes>> Moreover, children kill people in computer games and it makes them a<<aggressive**T14**Spelling**None**9**agressive>> About ten years ago, children did not have t<<an**T387**Articles**None**4**this>>opportunity to use computer every day, that is why they spent time with friends outside and p<<played**T17**Tense_choice**None**4**play>>"c<<children's**T18**Possessive**None**8**children>>games". As a result, t<<violent**T19**Ref_device**None**5**these>>games make them addicted and they want to m<<commit**T20**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>>c<<crimes**T21**Noun_number**None**5**crime>>in a<<real life**T22**Articles**None**11**a real life>>
Secondly, children have a lot of free time and they start to use in<<the Internet**T405**Articles**None**8**Internet>>ery early. There are many online websites which fo<<encourage young people to**T23**Prepositional_verb**Dependent_change**22**encourage young people>>a<<commit**T24**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>>r<<crimes**T390**Noun_number**None**5**crime>>These gr<<websites**T393**Coherence**None**6**groups>>ake teenagers ag<<aggressive**T9**Spelling**None**9**agressive>>nd children think that it is normal to do<<commit**T10**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>>r<<crimes**T395**Articles**None**5**crime>>or money or for your own reasons.
It <<These**T7**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**It>> <<are**T8**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>>ally difficult problems to be solved. Firstly, children should mak<<do**T4**Often_confused**None**4**make>>o<<sports**T397**Noun_number**None**5**sport>>t will help them ful<<fill**T25**lex_item_choice**None**4**full>>e<<their**T26**Spelling**None**5**there>>ee time. Moreover, when you mak<<do**T400**Often_confused**None**4**make>>o<<sports**T402**Noun_number**None**5**sport>>u can find good friends who have the same interests as you are#DELETE#3#, communicate with them and spend your free time together on different spo<<sports**T5**Noun_attribute**None**5**sport>>mpetitions.
Secondly, it is really important not to give computer or any gadgets with internet to young children. Parents and teachers should limit children's usin<<use**T28**Tense_choice**None**5**using>>g<<of**T3**Spelling**None**2**od>>gets, because it is bad for their mind.
To sum up, the problem of teenagers' crime is important nowda<<nowadays**T29**Spelling**None**7**nowdays>>adults should expla<<explain to**T405**Intransitive**None**7**explain>>g people that it is horrible to make <<commit**T32**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>>e<<crimes**T405**Noun_number**None**5**crime>>
