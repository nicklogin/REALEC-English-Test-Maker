Governments always tend to help citizens, as far as it is important that people have positive attitude to <<the leaders**T1**Articles**None**7**leaders>> of the country. One of the ideas<< which**T12**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> <<has been suggested**T13**Tense_choice**None**12**is suggested>> is a system called "Guaranteed Basic Income". The idea of this system is that there is a monthly payment for people even if they get <<a salary**T14**Articles**None**6**salary>>. Now I would like to elaborate on this topic and discuss advantages and disadvantages of this system.
O<<On the one hand**T2**Absence_comp_colloc**None**11**On one hand>> t<<it is**T15**lex_item_choice**None**8**there is>>a real help for people,<< who**T3**Defining**None**5**, who>>h<<lack**T16**Redundant**None**14**have a lack of>>money, whatever problem causes this situation. I suppose, it is important to help people,<< who**T4**Defining**None**5**, who>>c<<cannot**T17**Compound_word**None**7**can not>>a<<afford to buy**T18**Verb_Inf**None**13**afford buying>>even some basic and essential things. For example, there are families with many children,<< who**T20**Defining**None**5**, who>>need to be f<<fed**T5**Tense_form**None**4**feed>>and have clothes to wear but their income is not high enough. What is more, d<<a disabled person**T22**Articles**None**15**disabled person>>c<<cannot**T23**Compound_word**None**7**can not>>work well because of his or her disability but he or she still needs to buy food, medicines and some other stuff.
On the other hand, many people can be so lazy, << that**T24**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>hey will be happy to have sm<<a small amount**T25**Articles**None**12**small amount>>f money, but to be able to stay at home and do nothing. In my view, this can be not only bad for the person, << who**T26**Defining**None**5**, who>>refers this lifestyle, but also for the whole society.
To sum up, the system "Guaranteed Basic Income" is controversial because of the que<<doubt that**T10**lex_item_choice**None**12**question, if>>eryone really deserves this monthly payment. In my opp<<opinion**T7**Spelling**None**8**oppinion>>here should be more det<<regulations in this system to restrict who to pay money to**T8**lex_item_choice**None**69**details about this system, which allow to pay money not for everyone,>>cause sometimes it can become a waste of money for gov<<the government**T10**Articles**None**10**government>>
