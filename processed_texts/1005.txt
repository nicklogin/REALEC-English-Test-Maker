<<In fact,**T1**Punctuation**None**7**In fact>> I’m very surprised that in the 21st century <<humanity**T2**Articles**None**12**the humanity>> still deals with crimes – we are not savages, at least we don’t think that we are savages, but what can we see <<every day**T3**Spelling**None**8**everyday>> on TV and in the Internet? Crimes – corruption, murders, <<terrorist attacks**T5**Noun_number**None**16**terrorist attack>>. Why do people commit crimes? Are they really so immoral? And why do young people become criminals?
As for me, the majority of young criminals <<were born**T6**Tense_choice**None**14**have been born>> in not very healthy and well-educated families. We all know that there are some families that have <<criminal past**T7**Articles**None**15**a criminal past>> or present, in which parents (or a parent) drink or have a drug-addiction. Usually such families are very poor <<, and**T8**Punctuation**None**3**and>> fathers and mothers do not pay much attention to their children. Children see poverty, alcohol and drugs, they get used to <<these**T10**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> things, they also get used to crimes (may be they even think that it is a normal way of living and solving their problems). Such <<children**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**5**teens>> are usually <<drug-dealers**T9**Suffix**None**13**drug-deallers>>, or thieves, or murderers. What can we do to help these people? It seems that their parents are not our partners <<, if**T13**Punctuation**None**2**if>> they are criminals themselves. What about teachers? As for me, teachers can help – they are able to discuss with their students different aspects of life, show that everyone can earn his living in a <<legal**T14**Category_confusion**None**3**law>> way. <<They**T15**Spelling**None**5**Their>> also can organize any group activities – teachers and students are able to grow vegetables together (and help hungry students, who can’t eat normally at home), clean <<schoolyard**T16**Compound_word**None**13**school’s yard>>, go in for <<sports**T18**Category_confusion**None**5**sport>>, do any projects – about science and society. It seems that <<government**T19**Articles**None**14**the government>> can also help these children by protecting them from violence, <<propagandizing**T20**Spelling**None**12**propahanding>> a healthy way of life, <<giving them**T21**Absence_explanation**None**6**giving>> the same opportunities as the children from rich districts have.
There is another type of criminals – children who <<were born**T22**Tense_choice**None**14**have been born>> in rich families, they have everything from their birthday <<, and**T23**Punctuation**None**3**and>> have nothing to do. These young people are usually drug <<addicts**T24**Category_confusion**None**8**addicted>>. It seems that their parents can fix the problem – they shouldn’t buy their children everything they want and show that a child should earn what he wants <<himself**T25**Redundant**None**10**by himself>>. Teachers also can help parents in creating a good image of self-development and productive labour. Also there are <<children**T26**Inappropriate_register**None**5**teens>> and then young adults who <<were born**T28**Tense_choice**None**14**have been born>> in rich families <<, and**T29**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<whose**T27**Conjunctions**None**5**which>> parents are not very honest – I’m talking about corruption. There are a lot of examples#DELETE#1#, when a child continues his parents’ “business” and also steals government’s money. That’s not good, but parents can’t help <<in**T31**Spelling**None**2**it>> this situation – only school and society can change the attitude of a child to corruption.
Teachers can not only discuss this crime with students, but also show the problems of corruption – poor children without parents, ill children and adults, bad streets, low teachers'#DELETE#1#, and doctors' <<salaries**T33**lex_item_choice**None**5**wages>>, poor old people – they all need extra money, which can be taken from the government’s money.
Also there are a lot of other types of criminals – from rich, poor and middle-class families. They all have their own problems and aims, reasons and solutions. But there is one common rule for every problem – first of all we should fix ourselves, then help our children to understand what is good and what is bad. But we should begin with ourselves.
