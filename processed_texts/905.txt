The chart represents the main trend in developing of the book market in four countries in 2014 and 2018.
 To start with, it is clearly seen from the chart that in the USA all figures <<are**T1**Tense_form**None**2**is>> going to <<change**T18**Tense_choice**None**10**be changed>> dramatically in four years. Printed books lost its positions in 2014, meanwhile <<eBook products**T2**Noun_number**None**5**eBook>> <<are expected to shoot**T7**Tense_choice**None**6**shoots>> up dramatically in 2018. In comparison, in the UK both figures of printed books and <<electronic books sales**T3**Absence_explanation**None**5**eBook>> <<are just expected to change slightly**T8**Tense_choice**None**20**just slightly change>> and stay almost on the same positions.
 Secondly, in Germany and China the <<sales**T9**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**5**usage>> of printed books <<do not**T15**Agreement_errors**None**7**doesn't>> really change. In Germany the numbers remain stable and in China <<there are**T5**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**there>> also no <<immense**T10**Category_confusion**None**10**immenselly>> jumps #DELETE#10#of figures.<<The same is true for**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**The same for>> eBooks in these two countries. The numbers stay almost #DELETE#2#on the same #DELETE#5#posts.
 To sum up, the forecast for 2018 shows that <<eBook production**T6**Absence_explanation**None**5**eBook>> will become more popular than in 2014. Although in China and in Germany there are not going to be any serious changes in developing of eBooks, <<there is**T15**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**there>> still some little tendency for it.
