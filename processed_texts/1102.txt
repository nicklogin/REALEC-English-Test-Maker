The following bar chart illustrates the use of major social networks: Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn among <<American**T1**Category_confusion**None**3**U.S>> adults divided into 4 age groups.
From the chart it becomes evident that younger Americans are much more involved in social <<networks**T2**Noun_number**None**7**network>> than their aged counterparts. Facebook holds the leading positions as more than a half among each <<age group**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**age>> has an account there, <<nevertheless,**T5**Punctuation**None**12**nevertheless>> <<Instagram**T4**Spelling**None**10**Instagramm>> and LinkedIn have found their niche groups as well.
Both Facebook and <<Instagram**T6**Spelling**None**10**Instagramm>> rely greatly on the young as 87% and 53% are presented in these social networks respectively. As the age goes up presence of this age group members in the network gradually diminishes (for Facebook) or drastically slumps if we have a closer look at <<Instagram**T8**Spelling**None**10**Instagramm>>: the percentage of 30-49 <<year-old**T9**Compound_word**None**9**years old>> users is <<twice as low**T7**Numerical**None**10**twice less>> compared to <<the 18-29 group**T10**Articles**None**11**18-29 group>>. The statistics for Linkedin is quite remarkable: albeit it is not very popular nationwide, it still attracts a significant share (31% and 30%) in the 30-49 and 50-64 age groups.
To sum #DELETE#2#it up, <<a user's activity in social networks**T15**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**31**presence in the social networks>> <<depends greatly**T17**Standard**None**15**greatly depends>> on <<his**T16**Pronouns**Dependent_change**6**user’s>> age while <<a network's**T20**Articles**None**9**network’s>> content defines <<its**T12**Pronouns**None**4**it’s>> target <<audience.**T21**Punctuation**None**8**audience>> <<For example,**T22**Linking_device**None**2**as>> <<Instagram**T13**Spelling**None**10**Instagramm>> is more youth-oriented, Facebook is used by almost everyone and LinkedIn is helpful for those who work.
