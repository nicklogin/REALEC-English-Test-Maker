This chart illustrates <<the information**T1**Articles**None**11**information>> about development of the book market in <<the USA**T2**Articles**None**3**USA>>, Germany, China and <<The United Kingdom**T3**Articles**None**14**United Kingdom>>. The chart is based on <<numbers**T10**Noun_number**None**6**number>> of <<printed books and eBooks in 2014 and 2018**T11**Redundant**None**58**printed books in 2014 and 2018 and eBooks in 2014 and 2018>>. <<First**T4**Spelling**None**5**Firsk>> of all, we can see a tendency <<towards the decrease**T12**Absence_explanation**None**10**of falling>> of printed <<books**T13**Possessive**None**6**book's>> market. This index in all countries is <<getting lower**T14**lex_item_choice**None**7**falling>> or <<does not grow**T15**Absence_explanation**None**6**stable>>, as in Germany. For example, <<the USA**T5**Articles**None**3**USA>> demonstrates this more than other countries. In 2014 10,5 billion US dollars were <<paid**T16**Spelling**None**5**payed>> for printed books. However, in 2018 this index is only <<7,5 billion**T17**Numerals**None**12**7,5 billions>> US dollars. <<At the same time**T18**Articles**None**16**In the same time>>, profit from <<selling**T19**Redundant_comp**None**10**selleng of>> eBooks increases <<by 3 billion dollars**T20**Prepositions**None**17**3 billion dollars>>. Nevertheless, many people continue to buy <<printed**T21**lex_item_choice**None**6**simple>> books. In <<Germany**T22**lex_item_choice**None**6**German>> the situation is stable: 6 billion US dollars <<were**T7**Agreement_errors**None**3**was>> <<paid**T23**Spelling**None**5**payed>> in 2014 and <<it will be the same**T24**Absence_explanation**None**10**it will be>> in 2018 too. <<All in all,**T25**Inappropriate_register**None**8**Although>> <<the eBook market**T8**Articles**None**12**eBook market>> gradually rose. Besides that, this chart can demonstrate the popularity of reading in <<these countries**T26**Noun_number**None**12**this country>>. China has the biggest population in the world, as every person <<knows**T9**Agreement_errors**None**4**know>>, but Chinese book market is small: <<British**T28**lex_item_choice**None**2**UK>> <<book market**T27**Spelling**None**10**bookmarket>> <<is less**T29**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**less>> than <<Chinese**T30**Absence_explanation**None**2**it>> <<by**T31**Prepositions**None**2**on>> 2 billion US dollars, although <<the UK**T33**Articles**None**2**UK>> is <<much smaller**T32**Comparative_adj**None**7**smaller>>.
