While some people connected with music/film industry or not blame “pirates” for stealing others money by downloading content on the Internet, others used to listen to the music and to watch films for free and do not want to punish pirates.

On the one hand, I think that people of art, who shoot brilliant films or make popular music deserve to be appreciated and to be well-payed. 

Buying the original discs and alboms in iTunes is the perfect way to thank your favourite artist. They spend a lot of time and emotions to cheer you up with music, to provoke something in you.  Isn’t it a reason for punishing people downloading files on the Internet for free? I guess it is, because it makes the work of an artist worthless.

For example, this month there was an issue with brothers Strugatskie’s novels. It was decided to download their books on the web because there was no sence to fight the pirates anymore. I read Strugatskie’s only using books from my library, and this situation really upset me.

On the other hand, very popular stars make fortune by every live consert. If you don’t buy an albom, they won’t lose so much.

Moreover, I do not want to pay for something I will not like after listening. I think many people even happy to pay to someone they adore but at the same time never pay someone they listen to for the first time or simply once a year.

All and all, this issue has lots of pros and contras.
