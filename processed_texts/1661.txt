The bar chart illustrates the development of the book market for two years (2014 and 2018) in the USA, Germany, China and the United Kingdom.
First of all, the most significant point is that the greatest amount of books of any type is produced in the USA. The smallest rate of sellings is in the UK. The main feature is that in all countries the market of electronic books is lower than the market of <<printed**T1**Category_confusion**None**5**print>> books in 2014, and then, turning to 2018, predictions are different. For example, there <<will**T2**Tense_choice**None**5**would>> be more eBooks in the USA and the UK in 2018 (10,5 billion US Dollars and 2,3 billion Dollars respectively).
However, in Germany and China the amount of eBooks <<will**T3**Tense_choice**None**5**would>> not grow rapidly: sells in Germany <<will**T4**Tense_choice**None**5**would>> extend from 1 to 1,5 billion US Dollars, and in China the growth will amount 0,5 billion Dollars too.
To summarize, the situation with the book market in four countries is different, though it is important to emphasize that in the UK the correlation in amount is not significant and it would be stable for the period of four years.
