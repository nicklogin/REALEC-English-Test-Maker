It is agreed that nowadays young people commit more crimes than ever before. This development could be caused by different problems. Often teenagers couldn't solve these problem and they need parents or teachers’ help.
I am not agreeing with this statement. Of course, young people commit crimes, but, first of all, not all teenagers do that. There are a lot of people from different bands or gipsy, who have not their own family and house and they just should alive. That is why they started committing crimes.
Secondly, these crimes, which are committed by young people, are not serious, nothing more than stealing for their pocket money. Often, they do that just for fun. The real crimes like murders are committed by adults, who are learning how to commit crime by several years.

In my opinion, the only people who could solve this problem are parents. Children just want some attention from them and sometimes when teenagers couldn't accept that, they started doing all that things like stealing in shops, cheating and others. I think, parents should spent more time with their children. Also, teachers should talk with their students more.
