<<A. Orlenko**T1**NOUN**None**8**Nowadays>> we live in era of modern <<technology**T316**Spelling**None**9**tecnology>>. There is no doubt that with help of different <<technological**T317**Spelling**None**12**tecnological>> development our <<life**T318**Spelling**None**4**live>> <<is**T319**Spelling**None**2**in>> becoming easier and more convinient. However, some people argue that such development can be very harmful for people and even cause heath problems.
First of all, there can be different problems with people's back. While sitting in front of <<a TV**T320**Articles**None**2**TV>> or <<a computer**T321**Articles**None**8**computer>>, people usually do not care about their pose. So, incorrect sitting can case different heath problems, <<for example,**T322**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> terrible <<backache**T324**Spelling**None**9**bach-ache>>, which usually can not be <<cured**T323**lex_item_choice**None**6**solved>> easily. 
Moreover, nowadays we use our mobile phones all days round. So, they have become a real drug for people, <<who**T325**Non_defining**None**5**whose>> even do not understand what negative effect their gadjets have. So, phones influence not only the psychological state of <<a person**T326**Articles**None**6**person>>, but also, of <<course**T327**Spelling**None**6**coruse>>, <<people's**T328**Possessive**None**7**peoples>> vision. Most people nowadays <<wear**T329**Tense_choice**None**11**are wearing>> glasses because of problems with eyes, which were caused by little screens of their mobile phones. For example, I <<wear**T330**Tense_choice**None**7**wearing>> glasses, but my parents have ideal vision. So, my eyes were spoiled, firstly, by <<the computer**T332**Articles**None**8**computer>> and then by <<the mobile phone**T331**Articles**None**12**mobile phone>>, which I used to play very often.
To reduce <<these**T333**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> problems, people should, first of all, <<start**T334**Modals**None**8**to start>> to take care of their health. We can not do <<anything**T335**Pronouns**None**9**something>> with developing technologies, but we should think about our attitude to them. Because, not <<everything that is modern and convenient**T336**Defining**None**42**everything, that is modern and convenient,>> is useful and <<safe**T337**lex_item_choice**None**11**not harmful>>.
Taking everything into consideration, nowadays it is better not to be fashionable with modern <<gadgets**T339**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>>, <<which**T340**Spelling**None**4**wich>> cause different health problems, but to pay attention, <<in the first place**T341**lex_item_choice**None**7**firstly>>, to your health.
