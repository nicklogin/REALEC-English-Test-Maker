The crimes among the young have increased more than ever before. This may be caused by things like poverty, lack of education, physical and mental abuse, violent computer games, etc. This essay will discuss possible approaches for parents and teachers to be taken to solve this problem.
Firstly, the responsibility of raising the young generation lies with their parents. Making sure that their child is not involved in violent or abusive activities is crucial in this case. Parents should monitor the types of computer games their children play. Knowing who their child is friends with is also necessary, because peers often shape each other's mindsets, which sometimes results in seemingly quiet kids being involved in bullying or any kind of activities that include violence.
