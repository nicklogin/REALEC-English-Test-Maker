The graph shows the percentage use of three networks by different age groups. The three main networks are facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn and people (18+) are splet in 4 groups. People young generation group (18-29 y.o.) are the most active Face book and Instagram users (87% and 53% respectively).
The older generation is, the less it uses social networks like Facebook and Instagram. Older generation prefer Facebook over Instagram: for 65+ y.o. group Facebook penetration is almost 9 times higher than for instagram. As a rule, the older generation is, the less it uses social networks and the higher the difference between Facebook and Instagram usage. 
For Linkedin this rule does not work: the youngest and the oldest group have the same LinkedIn penetration (22%) which is lower than for other 2 groups (30-49 y.o. and 59-64 y.o) as they have on average 30,5% Linkedin penetration.
