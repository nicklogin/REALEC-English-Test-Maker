The pie chart gives us the information about unemployment in different world regions in 2014 and 2015.

The prominent trend of this chart is in the fact that in developed countries with the strong economics the level of unemployment is significantly lower in contrast with developing countries. The highest percentage of unemployment is in Northern Africa whereas the lowest level is in South Asia.

Another main feature is that 2015 year did not change the issue of unemployment  in selected world regions dramatically. The peack of pie chart in Northern Africa and the lowest point in South Asia stayed the same. The worldwide level stayed similar, too.

So the percentage of unemployed people in North Africa accounts for 12,5 in both years, 2014 and 2015. In South Africa this level makes up for 3,9, which is 4 times smaller. Also in Latin America the number is not too high and accounts for 6,8, whereas in Middle East it is 11 in 2014. In 2015 the situation with the unemployment didnâ€™t change sharply and we can see 5,8% vs 9,6%. However, the level of unemployment decreased in these world regions. But it increased in EU from 7,5% in 2014 to 7,9% in 2015.
