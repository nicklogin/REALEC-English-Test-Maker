<<Nowadays**T1**lex_item_choice**None**5**Today>> films and music <<are**T2**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> <<a big part**T3**Articles**None**12**the big part>> of the culture. We <<cannot**T4**Spelling**None**7**can not>> <<imagine**T5**Spelling**None**6**imagen>> our <<lives**T6**Spelling**None**5**lifes>> without listening to music while walking to the bus stop or watching <<films**T7**Noun_number**None**4**film>> with friends on Saturday <<evenings**T8**Noun_number**None**7**evening>>. But if we will <<pay for**T9**Prepositional_verb**None**3**pay>> all <<times**T10**Noun_number**None**4**time>> when we are doing <<these**T11**Ref_device**None**4**this>> normal things <<, the cultural life**T12**Punctuation**None**17**the cultural life>> becomes just for <<the rich part**T13**Articles**None**9**rich part>> of the world.

At first, <<we all**T14**lex_item_choice**None**9**all of us>> <<know**T15**Agreement_errors**None**5**knows>> that movies and music creators make money on the advertisment. <<For example,**T16**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> in every film we can see some brend of clothes, marks of cars, or food like Twix, <<Oreo**T17**Spelling**None**4**Orep>> e.t.c. If we will think <<from that point of view**T18**lex_item_choice**None**12**on that side>>, then somebody <<stealing**T19**lex_item_choice**None**4**stil>>l and <<sharing**T20**Tense_choice**None**5**share>> <<a film**T21**Articles**None**8**the film>> on the <<Internet**T22**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> it is not a problem<< because**T23**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> all people can <<watch it**T24**lex_item_choice**None**3**see>> and the creator does not lose lots of money. Because <<he**T25**Absence_explanation**None**9**the money>> #DELETE#2#is from the advertisment. 

Secondly, most music fans, if they like the group will buy the T-shorts or something like that with photos of favourite groups. That also helps making and saving money.

<<In conclusion,**T28**Punctuation**None**13**At conclusion>> I want to explicate that sharing something on the Internet does the matirial more popular and then it becomes importat for other people. From all that I <<wrote**T31**Tense_choice**None**17**have been written>> we can understand that illegal copies just help film and music makers become popular and famous. <<It**T32**Ref_device**None**4**That>> gives them more money and profit.
