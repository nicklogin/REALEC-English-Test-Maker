The impact which pirate copies have on legal film- and music-making industry has been a huge theme For negotiations since the time illegal copying has appeared. Some people claim that this process is a crime as you steal someone’s product of intellectual property and the crime should be punished. I partly agree with this position though this situation is not clear enough. 

To begin with, I strongly agree with the fact that pirate copie is a theft because, as told by the legal law, the process of film copying is not legal as well as people involved in film-making and music-making are not getting payed for. Their job properly as their salaries are mostly based on the box office for tiloms and wages from sales of music tracks, vinyl and CD-disks for music tracks. In my opinion, as far as every job should be payed and due to the fact of respect for the musicians and film producers people should purchase such things. The fact is that all commercial artists claim for restrictments in this law-sphere. 

The part about punishing people for downloading pirate copies is the part I should disagree with. I think that these people are less guilty than those one who made a copy and even if there is a place for punishment it should not be too tough. It might be a good lesson if the person would be asked to get the legal copy and that would be enough. Besides, not every person on Earth have enough money even for Food and such people can not be punished for the interest in self-educating.

To summarize all the points I stated here, I came to the conclusion that downloading products of someone’s intellectual property at least is not fair. This theft cannot be left unnoticed but the biggest part of it is in hand of the “pirate” himself while the punishment for the downloaders should be minimal.
