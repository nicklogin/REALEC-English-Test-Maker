The picture of bar chart introduces the unemployment rate in five world regions and worldwide during the period from 2014 to 2015.
<<To begin with**T1**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**To begin>>, the chart deals with worldwide indicators in 2014 and 2015. As can be seen, <<the unemployment rate**T2**Articles**None**17**unemployment rate>> was the same through these <<years**T3**Noun_number**None**4**year>> and was 5.9 points.
However, the <<bar chart**T4**Absence_comp_colloc**None**3**bar>> provides <<a strong evidence**T5**Articles**None**15**strong evidence>> that the situation in different parts of our planet wasn’t the same. As it is evident from the picture, the lowest unemployment rate was in S. Asia. It was two points lower then the worldwide indicator and remained steady at 3.9 points for <<observed**T18**lex_item_choice**None**8**whaching>> period. What’s more, the highest rate was in N. Africa where it reached 12.5 points. <<There was a significant difference with other three regions in indicators.**T11**Punctuation**None**83**There was a significant differencedifference with other three regions in indicators>> It’s clear that in <<the Middle East**T13**Articles**None**11**Middle East>> and Latin America the unemployment rate had fallen <<by**T14**Prepositions**None**2**in>> 2015. The difference between two years was 1,4 points and 2 points in <<the Middle East**T15**Articles**None**11**Middle East>> and Latin Aemrica. The opposite tendency can be seen in <<the EU**T16**Tense_choice**None**2**EU>> where <<the rate**T17**Articles**None**4**rate>> increased from 7,5 to 7.9 points.
Above all, <<the chart**T18**Articles**None**5**chart>> demonstrates different tendencies in 2014 and 2015 years, but worldwide this indicator remained stable.
