By the way, planes are the mo<<safest**T403**Superlative_adj**None**9**most safe>>ransport in the world. As for me, I will choose air travel, because I like to travel fast and without problems. Besides it, cars are the most dirty type of transport and it is not correct to say that planes gives more pollution.
