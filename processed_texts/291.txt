People’s opinion on the problem of sharing illegal copies of films and music <<differs**T1**Confusion_of_structures**None**9**is differ>> widely. Some people believe that there is no sin in watching pirate copies while others claim that copying and sharing music or films must be punished.
It is my firm belief that it is problems of <<musicians**T2**Suffix**None**8**musicans>> and film producers if somebody “gets” their money, so they should pay more attention to their problem of saving it. In addition, I consider that if I <<can**T3**Modals**None**5**could>> find <<a good film**T4**Articles**None**9**good film>> in high quality with <<a good translation**T5**Articles**None**16**good translation>> and it has no <<difference**T6**Category_confusion**None**6**differ>> with <<the original**T7**Articles**None**8**original>> that <<costs**T8**Agreement_errors**None**4**cost>> some money, I may download it without doubts or regrets.
Nevertheless, there are <<opponents**T9**Noun_number**None**8**opponent>> of this view who claim that it is bad. They also point out that everyone should buy original versions thinking about producers’ money. But I strongly disagree with them, because people should pay money only for tickets in the cinema and music halls, especially if they see singers alive. But if I watch <<a film**T10**Articles**None**4**film>> at home, it <<should**T11**Modals**None**5**could>> be free. I also want to repeat that if people (I mean producers and <<musicians**T12**Suffix**None**8**musicans>>) lose money, they just try <<badly**T13**Category_confusion**None**3**bad>> to save it.
In addition, <<government**T20**Spelling**None**14**the government>> shouldn’t punish people<< who use illegal copies**T16**Defining**None**24**, who use illegal copies>>; <<if it wants to solve this problem,**T18**Punctuation**None**33**if it wants to solve this problem>> it should try to stop copying and sharing music or <<a film**T19**Articles**None**4**film>> and punish people who make such files.
I hope, my arguments are convincing, and somebody could support my point of view.
P.S. I also want to remark that original films and music that cost money are not always given in perfect quality. In contrast with pirates’ copies that everybody always can find with <<a good translation**T20**Articles**None**16**good translation>> and download very quickly.
