Nowadays we live in <<the age**T1**Articles**None**6**an age>> of high technologies. <<We**T2**Capitalisation**None**2**we>> use a lot of them, especially the internet. It is a huge problem#DELETE#1#, when people copy films or music and share it <<on**T3**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the internet. <<This situation**T6**Determiners**None**14**Such situation>> is very costly for <<film studios**T5**Articles**None**16**the film studios>> and musicians. Some people <<believe**T35**lex_item_choice**None**8**consider>> that people<< who**T7**Defining**None**5**, who>> download films and music for free from the internet, instead of buying original discs in a shop, should be punished. There are some arguments against this point of view.
Firstly, <<illegal pirate copies**T9**Articles**None**25**the illegal pirate copies>> of films and music appear <<on**T10**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the internet after the <<premiere**T11**Spelling**None**7**premier>> of <<a film**T12**Articles**None**8**the film>> in cinemas. In some situations#DELETE#1#, <<pirate copies**T14**Articles**None**17**the pirate copies>> <<appear**T8**Tense_choice**None**8**appeared>> <<on**T15**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the internet 2 weeks after the film started in cinemas. In 2 weeks the producers of this film usually can gain a lot of money from cinemas and usually the amount of money is more <<than**T31**Spelling**None**4**that>> a budget of the film. Moreover, the quality <<of**T16**Spelling**None**1**f>> pirate copies is often bad, with awful sound and <<a dark picture**T18**Articles**None**12**dark picture>>. That’s why a lot of people prefer to buy licensed discs. <<Following**T33**lex_item_choice**None**2**In>> this logic, <<the police**T20**Articles**None**6**police>> shouldn’t arrest people<< who**T19**Defining**None**5**, who>> share <<pirate files**T34**Absence_explanation**None**5**files>>.
<<Moreover**T21**Linking_device**None**4**Then>>, it can be easily seen<< that**T23**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> the governments of <<different countries**T24**Articles**None**23**the different countries>> all over the world try to ban web-sites in the internet<< where**T25**Defining**None**7**, where>> people can download pirate copies of films. But this policy of blocking web-sites doesn’t work, because there are a lot of hackers<< who**T17**Defining**None**5**, who>> can hack the system and continue to share illegal <<content**T36**lex_item_choice**None**5**files>>. If <<the police**T26**Articles**None**6**police>> catch one hacker, there will be another one. This is a “<<vicious circle**T27**Absence_explanation**None**6**circle>>”, and there is no way to break it.
In conclusion <<it**T28**Pronouns**None**5**there>> should be said<< that**T29**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> people will always share illegal films and music. <<The important thing is that**T37**Linking_device**None**12**In this way,>> <<musicians**T30**Articles**None**13**the musicians>> and film producers should make <<quality**T22**Category_confusion**None**11**qualitative>> content. If they make good films, people will visit cinemas instead of downloading films from the internet.
