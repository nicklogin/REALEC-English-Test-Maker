Many people are in favour of discussing the rise teenagers involving in harmful and dangerous way of life. Unfortunately,not everyone can protect their child from entering the world of crime.
Further in my essay I would like to speak about various possible reasons for this upward trend and who and how can deal with this problem.

Firstly, there is a huge amount of adverse servers and advertisement nowadays.Therefore, any child wants to be the 'the coolest' person in the class, he or she desired of having great power and everybody dreams of bey<<being**T1**Spelling**None**6**beying>>oked up to. Usually, all this can be reached only by fierce actions. For instance, the boy who is fourteen meets the young rap band and he wants to be one of them, but those boys could only just laugh at him and force to do unpleasant things.
Moreover, another important cause of engaging in crime could be the lack of money. There is such an enormous number of products that a toung person could have wanted. Every expensive thing is observed and studied by a youngman from every side, and it is vitu<<vitually**T2**Spelling**None**8**vituallu>>e<<necessary**T3**Spelling**None**9**necessaru>> him or she to get it. This situation can lead to completely awful consequences, for example, shoplifting, shooting or even murder.
Talking about the solutions, the first thing that has come to my mind is the parent-child relashionships and parents control, you should spend as much time with your child in his or her childhood as you can, at least simply giving advice what is wrong and what is right. In addition, I believe that special cources at school would greatly help pupils. In my view, every teacher should think about it and maybe prepare a short speech on different topics in crime and the health of every student.

Overall, there are numerous reasons for crime development between young persons, however, there are not less ways to combat I would strongly recommend every adult person to be aware of your children's hobbies or friend, try to protect them with the help of teachers or doctors - do everything what is needed for your child to be safe.
