Nowadays everything <<changes**T1**Agreement_errors**None**6**change>> with <<an extremely speed**T2**Articles**None**15**extremely speed>>. <<Technologies**T3**Noun_number**None**10**Technology>> do not stay at the same place too. People <<cannot**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> even <<imagine**T5**Spelling**None**6**imagen>> their lives without computers, telephones, television<<. But**T6**Spelling**None**5**, But>> sometimes things <<which seem to us good**T7**Defining**None**22**which seem to us good,>> can cause many problems with our health.

In my opinion, we should <<start to talk**T8**Prepositions**None**10**start talk>> about <<mobile**T10**Spelling**None**6**mobily>> telephones. Today our telephone is not only a thing to <<talk**T11**Often_confused**None**5**speak>> and contact to each other, but now mobile is our book, our game, our photo-camera and many other things. There are people who <<cannot**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> even stay one hour without his/her mobile. Then they get up, they check the mobile, they <<read neews**T13**Absence_explanation**None**4**read>> while eating. I think that modern mobile phones <<are**T14**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> an <<absolute**T15**Spelling**None**7**absolut>> <<bomb with**T17**Prepositions**None**7**bomb of>> <<a very slow move**T18**Articles**None**19**very very slow move>>. <<Firstly,**T22**Punctuation**None**7**Firstly>> we all know about <<the radiation**T23**Articles**None**9**radiation>> from all our devices. Secondly, <<sitting**T24**Spelling**None**7**seeting>> <<from ten**T25**Prepositions**None**7**for ten>> to forty hours a day <<staring**T26**lex_item_choice**None**8**watching>> at a small screen can cause great problems with your <<eyes**T27**Spelling**None**3**yes>>. 

Another <<technologies**T28**Noun_number**None**12**technology l>>inked with smoking are ‘vapes’. During two years million of people <<are buying**T30**Tense_form**None**7**botight>> this electron cigarette, saying that this new technology will help them to stop smoking tobacco. The problem is that nobody even think about the <<compound**T31**lex_item_choice**None**10**consisting>> of <<these**T32**Ref_device**None**4**this>> vapes. Not only <<adults**T33**Noun_number**None**5**adult>>, but teenagers <<, too,**T34**Punctuation**None**3**too>> smoke this electron cigarette during all day, thinking that a hundred of different peroxids will not destroy their body. Smoking is a legalized drug, #DELETE#2#by <<e-cigarettes**T36**Spelling**None**18**electron ciggarets>> are drugs <<being packed**T37**Tense_form**None**10**being pack>> in a very beautiful box.

<<In conclusion,**T38**Punctuation**None**12**In conclusio>>n I would like to say that the problem of our world, our decade and new technologies <<consists**T39**Agreement_errors**None**7**consist>> of the fact, that people buy all <<these**T40**Ref_device**None**4**this>> new things and start to use them like absolutely crazy men. All that was made with unnatural goods should be explored by us carefully.
