In recent years the concern about the protection of copyrights of the Internet’s contents has increased significantly as there are more and more contents that are uploaded to the Internet including music, movies. Many people believe that all <<online content**T2**Articles**None**18**the online content>> should have <<it's**T3**Ref_device**Dependent_change**5**their>> copyrights protected as well as online piracy should be considered as <<a crime**T4**Articles**None**5**crime>>. In my opinion, I think that there should be punishments for online piracy; the punishment should be <<based**T5**lex_item_choice**None**12**lowered base>> on the <<type**T6**Noun_number**None**5**types>> of content. 

Although online piracy is contributed to many financial problems #DELETE#29#as well as human brain draing, I think that it should be considered as << a grave crime**T8**Articles**None**11**grave crime>> and punishments can be <<adjusted**T10**Spelling**None**7**djusted>>. Firstly, sharing is one of the humanity’s basic instinct. It is inevitable because of the <<Internet**T11**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. <<Besides new-released contents,**T13**Punctuation**None**29**Besides new-released contents>> there are <<also**T14**Spelling**None**4**alse>> <<countries' contents**T17**Possessive**None**18**countries contents>> that <<were**T16**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> created long time <<ago**T15**Spelling**None**3**age>>. <<Personally**T18**Category_confusion**None**8**Personal>> speaking, I think the old music or movies are not <<worth**T19**Category_confusion**None**6**wothly>> to pay to savor, but they are too old compared to those <<recently**T20**lex_item_choice**None**5**newly>> released. Not all <<online contents**T22**Articles**None**19**the online contents>> should have copyrights, but sometimes some of them should <<, and for that**T23**Punctuation**None**13**and for that,>> raising people’s awareness regarding to <<how the piracy**T24**Punctuation**None**15**how, the piracy>> can cause the author <<or**T25**Spelling**None**2**of>> the writer of the song and why they should use copyrighted productions. Furthermore, people <<do not**T26**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> even know how they will <<damage**T27**Spelling**None**5**damge>> the author <<when**T28**lex_item_choice**None**2**of>> they use piracy contents#DELETE#27#, so raising the awnereness. 

In conclusion, I believe that <<the piracy**T31**Category_confusion**None**8**picating>> in <<the Internet**T30**Articles**None**8**Internet>>  is a real crime.
