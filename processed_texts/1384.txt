Nowadays, there is a popular opinion that technological progress and gadgets as its consequence have a <<harmful**T1**Spelling**None**7**hurmful>> influence on people related to their health. Unfortunately, it is true, but it is really hard to find a direct <<solution**T2**Spelling**None**9**solvation>>.

To begin with, the most widespread <<disease**T3**lex_item_choice**None**7**illness>> is blindness #DELETE#25#and harm on eyes and view. <<Most modern people**T5**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**33**Most contemporary world populatio>>n <<use**T6**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**4**uses>> mobile phones and <<depend on**T7**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**10**depends on>> them. We can see <<an enormous amount**T8**Articles**None**15**enormous amount>> of young people mostly who <<spend all time**T9**Prepositions**None**17**spend all time on>> chatting and surfing <<on the Internet**T10**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>>. As a consequence, these people lose their <<eyesight**T11**lex_item_choice**None**9**good view>> and thus need to wear glasses. Moreover, <<mobile phones**T12**Absence_explanation**None**6**mobile>>, <<computers**T13**Noun_number**None**8**computer>> and TV <<screens**T14**Noun_number**None**6**screen>> <<affect**T15**Agreement_errors**None**7**affects>> our brain and <<destroy**T16**Agreement_errors**None**8**destroys>> it through our eyes. For instance, I know people who have a frequent <<headaches**T17**Noun_number**None**8**headache>> because of endless looking at their smartphones.

As I have already mentioned, the problem of <<the rising amount**T18**Articles**None**13**rising amount>> of illnesses is hart to solve. However, it is real to reduce these illnesses. Firstly, the young generation is affected by new technologies more than others. So parents should make gaps for their children in using #DELETE#2#of mobile phones. At the same time, it is better to make kids <<to read**T20**Infinitive_constr**None**4**read>> books because <<it is**T21**Inappropriate_register**None**4**itâ€™s>> <<a more useful and developing activity**T22**Articles**None**35**more useful and developing activity>>. Secondly, it is necessary to invent harmless screens that would not destroy our eyes. For example, there are some inventions, like protecting glasses, that stop <<the harmful influence**T23**Articles**None**17**harmful influence>> from <<the computer or mobile phone**T24**Articles**None**24**computer or mobile phone>>. Moreover, they make you more fashioned, but their essential meaning is <<to protect**T25**Infinitive_constr**None**10**protecting>>, of course.

In conclusion, problems with health caused by technologies really exist. <<However,**T26**Punctuation**None**7**However>> we can help ourself #DELETE#12#by ourselves and buy things to protect our eyes and brain. Surely, we should reduce our smartphones using in the first place.
