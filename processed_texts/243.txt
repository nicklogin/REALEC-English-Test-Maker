It is well-known that the <<entertainment**T1**Spelling**None**11**entertiment>> industry gets enormous damage from illegal copying of their products every year. Now everybody <<can easiy sit**T3**Verb_Bare_Inf**None**18**can easily sitting>> at home in front of a laptop and watch any movie he wants and will not pay even 1 cent. And a lot of people believe that such illegal activity should be punished as other crimes. As for me, I absolutely agree with this position because of some reasons.
First of all, thefts of such type in <<the first place**T4**Articles**None**11**first place>> <<harm**T6**lex_item_choice**None**6**suffer>> people who are responsible for all these movies and music that people enjoy every minute. They <<do**T7**Often_confused**None**4**make>> their own work as all other people including <<politicians**T8**Derivation**None**8**politics>> and <<the police**T27**Articles**None**6**policy>> and therefore they have to get their salary. <<If something is a theft,**T11**Punctuation**None**23**If something is a theft>> it is always <<a crime**T13**Articles**None**5**crime>>. <<So why should the rules for thefts of this type be different?**T14**Interrogative**None**61**So why the rules for thefts of this type should be different?>> Moreover, copying and sharing programmes, music and films is prohibited by the law. It is obvious that people who do this dirty work <<need**T17**Modals**None**8**are need>> to be found and punished.
By the way, there is another point of view. Everybody <<loves watching**T18**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**11**loves watch>> films and listen to the music as it makes people happy in <<daily**T19**Spelling**None**5**dayly>> routine and sometimes even give power to do another step. Nevertheless, not all of them can get it because of low income. So, copies <<on**T20**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet <<are**T21**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> the only way to touch this. <<Other**T22**Often_confused**None**7**Another>> people live in such special areas<< where**T23**Punctuation**None**7**. where>> modern foreign film industry, for example, is prohibited by the goverment as in some east countries.
To sum up, it is evident that such copying of information is <<an illegal activity**T25**Articles**None**16**illegal activity>> as people who produce all this music and films <<are greatly harmed**T26**Word_choice**Dependent_change**18**have greately harm>>.
