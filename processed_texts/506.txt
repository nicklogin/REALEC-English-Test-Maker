One of the main topics of <<the last century**T3**Articles**None**12**last century>> was space exploration. Many great discoveries were made, but are they so great that they mean more than unsolved issues on Earth? I tend to agree with the opinion that <<the money**T4**Articles**None**5**money>> spent on space exploration can be more useful on Earth.
First of all, poverty is still a very big issue in lots of countries. There a<<are**T5**Spelling**None**1**a>>still places where average income is about 15 dollars a month, whereas one spaceship s<<launch**T325**lex_item_choice**None**5**start>>(not always a f<<successful**T327**lex_item_choice**None**9**fortunate>>one) costs billions of dollars.
There are many other problems in the world which can be solved with money. For example, some enviromental issues, such as pollution. In China th<<it**T1**lex_item_choice**None**4**this>>s a very big problem. There are a lot of cities with more than a million of people, this means that there are huge numbers of cars on<<in**T6**Prepositions**None**2**on>> small te<<area**T7**lex_item_choice**None**9**territory>>This led to co<<a constont smog**T9**Articles**None**13**constant smog>>n the streets which led to th#DELETE#4#at almost every citizen ha<<having**T330**Participial_constr**None**3**has>>roblems with th<<his or her**T331**Ref_device**None**5**their>>ungs. Although, there are solutions. For example, Si<<Singapore**T2**Spelling**None**10**Singapoore>>uilds high-tech systems to grow as many plants on their territory as they can.

On the other hand, space exploration gives us knowledge of some fundamental laws which will help to live a better life. Some people even say that someday everyone will just leave this planet and everything will get better. As for myself, I prefer not to think what wil<<will be left**T338**Absence_explanation**None**7**will be>>ter mys<<me**T336**Pronouns**None**6**myself>>t think about hig<<a higher quality of life**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**19**higher quality life>>
