The graph illustrates the percentage use of three different social networks (Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn) by adults in the USA by age group.
There is a noticeable trend that, though Facebook and Instagram demonstrate high negative correlation between percentage of users and age, LinkedIn follows a different pattern. <<Middle-aged**T1**Derivation**None**11**Middle aged>> groups (30 - 49, 50 - 64) are the most prominent in this social network, while <<generally**T2**Category_confusion**None**7**general>> <<leading**T3**Category_confusion**None**6**leader>> group (18 - 29) demonstrates the lowest participation rate. Only 27% of <<young people**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**10**youngsters>> use LinkedIn compared to 87% <<who use**T5**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**of>> Facebook and 53% <<who use**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**of>> Instagram.
Another important feature is general popularity of the following social networks. Facebook is almost twice as popular as Instagram, demonstrating higher percentage in every age group. As for Instagram and LinkedIn comparison, Instagram is more popular in general <<, though**T7**Punctuation**None**6**though>> LinkedIn overcomes Instagram in both <<middle-aged**T8**Derivation**None**11**middle aged>> and old groups. There were 31% LinkedIn users in 30 - 49 group compared to 25% Instagram <<users**T9**Ref_device**None**4**ones>>, 30% LinkedIn users in 50 - 64 group compared to <<11% Instagram users**T10**Ref_device**None**3**11%>> and <<22% Instagram users**T11**Absence_explanation**None**3**22%>> compared to <<6% users**T12**Absence_explanation**None**2**6%>> of LinkedIn.
