There is an opinion that the increase in use of the latest technology can lead to some of the health problems. I mostly agree with this point of view and I would like to give <<a couple of arguments**T1**Articles**None**19**couple of arguments>> to support this <<statement**T2**Spelling**None**5**state>>.

First of all, it is not a secret that <<mobiles**T3**Redundant**None**17**telephone mobiles>>, which we use everyday, produce radiowaves. <<These**T4**Ref_device**None**4**This>> waves are the reason of heart <<diseases**T5**Spelling**None**8**desieses>>. Many of experiements <<presented**T7**lex_item_choice**None**11**represented>>  <<the incredible results**T6**Articles**None**18**incredible results>>, #DELETE#5#where participants were divised in two groups: using and not using mobile phones for two months. Obviously, people from the first group had better results after several tests, which <<measure**T19**Agreement_errors**None**6**states>> heart work.

What is more, modern technology has a great impact on people’s lifestyle. The addiction to technical devices makes individuals lazier#DELETE#19#, less hard-working and can cause not only physical problems, but also <<mental ones**T12**Ref_device**None**6**mental>>. Therefore, such <<lifestyle**T13**Articles**None**11**a lifestyle>> is the reason of depression, apathy. If there is something<< that tackes control over our lives**T15**Defining**None**35**, that takes control over our lives>>, it always makes us feel miserable.

In conclusion, I would like to say, that <<all health problems caused by modern technology can be reduced**T17**Punctuation**None**70**all of the health problems caused by modern technology, can be reduced>>. Moderation is the key to <<success**T18**Articles**None**9**a success>>. If you <<do not**T19**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> spend more that an hour in front of the computer or television, it would never damage your eyesight, or not hanging
