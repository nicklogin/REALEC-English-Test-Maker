The given chart provides the information about unemployment rate in various world regions in 2014 and 2015. We can see that there <<was**T1**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> no big differences in one region in two selected years. In 2014 <<Northern Africa was the leader in the amount of unemployment**T12**Standard**None**60**the leader in the amount of unemployment was Northern Africa>>. In Africa there <<was**T5**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> approximately 12,5 per cent of unemployment. This number stayed stable, so in 2015 there <<was**T6**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> also 12,5 per cent of unemployment. <<The Middle East was next to the leader**T11**Standard**None**38**Next to the leader was the Middle East>> <<with**T9**Spelling**None**5**withe>> 11 per <<cent**T10**Spelling**None**4**sent>> of unemployment in 2014. But this number decreased, so in 2015 there <<was**T14**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> 9,6 per cent. The only region, where the percentage of <<unemployment**T15**Spelling**None**11**unemployent>> <<had risen**T29**Tense_form**None**9**has rised>>, is <<the EU**T18**Articles**None**2**EU>>. The percentage <<had risen**T29**Tense_form**None**9**has rised>> from 7,5 to 7,9 per <<cents**T21**Noun_number**None**5**cents>>. We also have <<a region**T22**Articles**None**6**region>> where the numbers stayed stable and quite low. It is South Asia, where the percentage <<was**T23**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> <<3,9 per cent**T24**Absence_explanation**None**3**3,9>>. <<If we look at worldwide results,**T25**Punctuation**None**31**If we look at worldwide results>> it would be quite surprising, because it is quite low, only 5,9 per cent of <<the unemployed**T26**Articles**None**10**unemployed>>. The worldwide result is made of different <<regions**T27**Possessive**None**8**regionâ€™s>> results, so it <<was**T28**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> much lower than, for example, in <<Northern**T29**Spelling**None**7**Nothern>> Africa.
