There is an opinion that countries should make products that their own people consume and also should aim to lessen imported products. I do not <<agree with this statement**T1**Prepositions**None**20**agree this statement>> because in some countries it would make <<a lack**T3**Articles**None**8**the lack>> of products. 

First and foremost <<if**T13**Spelling**None**2**it>> countries <<produced**T14**Tense_choice**None**13**would produce>> food that their own people consume there <<would be**T15**Tense_choice**None**7**will be>> no difference between consumable products in countries and this idea <<would not change**T16**Tense_choice**None**15**will not change>> list of products in these countries. 

Secondly, decrease of <<imported**T9**Category_confusion**None**6**import>> products <<may make a really bad impact**T11**Word_choice**None**28**may have a really bad impact>> on some countries. It may call the lack of products because these countries do not produce any food and whole amount of products is imported from other countries. <<If countries try**T4**Tense_choice**None**21**If countries will try>> to <<replace imported products with**T7**Prepositions**None**28**replace imported products by>> produced their people they will lose a lot of money and time. That makes this idea useless. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that countries must not only import food but also produce it.
