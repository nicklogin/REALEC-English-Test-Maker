Most of the <<counrties**T1**Spelling**None**7**counrys>> nowadays <<trade**T2**Tense_choice**None**7**trading>> with <<others**T3**Articles**None**10**the others>> a lot, but is this the right thing for a country to import tons of food rather than try to produce it itself?

For <<countries**T4**Spelling**None**8**countrys>> that do not have enough resources it is necessary to buy food from more fortunate ones, but <<countries**T5**Spelling**None**8**countrys>> like Russia, United States, Great Britain and many others can actually live with <<a minimum import**T6**Articles**None**14**minimum import>> of products, they can feed their own people, like Soviet Union did. <<A little amount**T7**Articles**None**13**Little amount>> of import would actually make a country more independent from <<the rest of the world**T8**lex_item_choice**None**15**the other world>> so that <<its**T9**Spelling**None**4**it’s>> problems <<would not**T10**Conditionals**None**5**won’t>> cause a lot of suffering for the population, like it would have, if <<a country**T11**Articles**None**7**country>> depended much on, for example, dairy products of <<a neighbour**T12**Articles**None**9**neighbour>>, which suffered from decrease, that struch their cows. 

<<The development**T13**Articles**None**11**Development>> of country’s production of food would also increase <<the number**T14**Articles**None**8**a number>> of the workplaces, and it would have a great impact on economics of the country, but it can still trade with others. It may prevent a deficit of something important, it also will make the relationship with others much better. North Korea is <<a good example of**T15**Prepositions**None**14**a good example>> how isolation <<may**T16**Spelling**None**2**ma>> be extremely bad for people. That way <<leads**T17**Agreement_errors**None**4**lead>> to starvation, bad <<relationships**T18**Noun_number**None**12**relationship>> or even hate from the world. Import and export <<are**T19**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> very important for people’s lives. <<They**T20**Ref_device**None**4**That>> <<give**T21**Agreement_errors**None**5**gives>> them a chance to choose a better product. <<They**T22**Ref_device**None**4**That>> <<give**T23**Agreement_errors**None**5**gives>> a competition for country’s cimpani, which will cause them to make <<their**T24**Spelling**None**5**there>> food better and/or cheaper. <<Afterall,**T29**Punctuation**None**7**Afteral>> little import dies have <<its**T27**Spelling**None**4**it’s>> pluses, but <<, in my opinion,**T28**Punctuation**None**13**in my opinion>> <<countries**T29**Spelling**None**9**countryes>> should trade with.
