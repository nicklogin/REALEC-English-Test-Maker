There is an opinion that using illegal drugs is not a crime and the punishment for it shouldn't be strict, for example, banning from competing professionally for 2 years. The others think that sportsmen will continue taking drugs till they wouldn't be banned for the rest of their lives. Let's discuss <<these two opinions**T1**Absence_explanation**None**4**them>>.
On the one hand, drugs are illegal in many countries. Taking drugs is a crime not only in sport but in general. And the punishment for it in Russia is strict: from 2 to 18 years <<of**T2**Prepositions**None**2**in>> prison. However, after being punished the career of a sportsman shouldn't stop. Doing <<sports**T3**Noun_number**None**5**sport>> and taking part in competitions is the only way they can earn on <<his or her**T4**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**their>> <<living**T13**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**7**livings>>. Moreover, it won't be just an end of <<his or her**T7**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**their>> professional <<career**T13**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**7**careers>> but the end of <<his or her**T10**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**their>> <<life**T13**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**lives>>.
On the other hand, once a sportsman tries an illegal drug his reputation will be spoiled forever. In addition, not only the name of an athlete but the name of the whole country will be in shame. And it will take a lot of time to gain an authority again. That's why such athletes should be banned from competing professionally for the rest of their lives.
In my opinion, such sportsmen who broke the law should be <<punished**T13**Spelling**None**8**panished>> for a short-term period and then have a chance to come back to competitions.
All in all, despite all of that, we are all people and we make mistakes. Everyone should have a second chance, that's the way we learn about life.
