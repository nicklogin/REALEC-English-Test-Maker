Nowadays Internet has changed a lot of things. We have much more communication and information than ever before. And most active category in Intenet, young people have now more influence on society. They catch more attention and everybody may hear their voice.
But this has an other side: teenagers often want catch as much attention as they could and this may lead to comitting crimes.
On the other hand Internet can make people more violent and may be angry. Video-games, action films rude communication all of this may lead to commiting crimes in real life.
To solve this problem teachers and parents should try to teach young people some empathy that depeciated in electronic era. Or maybe we should try to reshape the way how teenagers use Internet. Like educational courses instead video games or pictures. 
Another way of solving this problem is stop to enlight crimes commited by teenagers. They shouldn't know the person but should know the punishment he or she got.
So there is plenty solutions that may give results, but today there is no any measures to control influence of Internet on the young people.
