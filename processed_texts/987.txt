There is a sustainable trend on <<adolescents**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**10**youngsters>> criminality rate growth. Some people may claim that these high numbers are the result of <<the decay of modern society**T3**Articles**None**20**modern society decay>>, so that young generation has no moral values to hinder their crime. <<However,**T4**Punctuation**None**7**However>> I claim that this is not <<the most important**T5**Articles**None**14**most important>> reason. To me, it is developing technology that <<leads**T6**Agreement_errors**None**4**lead>> to the feeling of <<less**T7**Category_confusion**None**6**lesser>> crime responsibility, thus <<young people**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**10**youngsters>> are not afraid of punishment any more. What is left to their life mentors is to increase their morality <<, so that**T9**Punctuation**None**7**so that>> in the world of increased crime opportunity it would be inner rightness preventing people from illegal deeds.
On the other hand, many elder people now consider <<adolescents**T10**Inappropriate_register**None**10**youngsters>> as a spoiled generation with wrong behaviour and no moral constraints. That is why crime rate surged - that is what they think. However, if we <<look into**T11**Prepositional_verb**None**7**look in>> the history, there were <<thousands**T12**Agreement_errors**None**8**thousand>> of similar cases in Ancient Greece, European <<Renaissance**T13**lex_item_choice**None**12**revification>> period and etc. It is a human psychology feature to think that subsequent <<generations**T14**Agreement_errors**None**10**generation>> are worse than <<their ancestors**T15**Ref_device**None**8**they are>>, that morality fell sharply during their life.
I personally believe that <<the crime rate**T16**Articles**None**10**crime rate>> grew mainly because of increased crime opportunity. We live in the epoch of developing technologies where it is really easy to rob <<bank servers**T17**Articles**None**16**the bank servers>>, steal electronic money and even order a crime with the help of illegal websites. For example, Tor is an effective platform for buying guns, distributing drugs <<, and**T18**Punctuation**None**3**and>> etc. Thus, it became really easy to do illegal things with less chances to be caught.
To conclude, we should return to <<the moral aspect**T19**Articles**None**12**moral aspect>> of crime. Governments can no longer prohibit illegal paths <<or block**T20**Modals**None**8**blocking>> <<illegal sites**T25**Articles**None**9**the sites>>, <<because**T23**Conjunctions**None**5**while>> they will open again somewhere else - it is just a matter of time. A thorough moral remedy should be considered to cure <<adolescents**T24**Inappropriate_register**None**10**youngsters>> and <<society**T25**Articles**None**11**the society>> itself.
Diminish crime reasons, so that the problem would disappear.
