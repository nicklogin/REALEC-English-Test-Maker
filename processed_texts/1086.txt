The given chart illustrates the unemployment rate in selected regions and worldwide in 2014 and 2015.

The greatest tendency that we can see is that the worldwide unemployment rate did not change in these two years. The number of unemployment people all over the world was not so huge. However it is obvious that in North Africa unemployment was a serious issue because the percentage of unemployment was extremely high. As for the lowest rate, South Africa had stable law numbers.

the Middle East and Latin America percentage of unemployment was decreased in 2015, whereas in Europe the rate rose. The situation in North Africa and South Africa was stable. All fluctuations in developed countries (for example, in Europe) could have been connected with economical and social issues. 

The decreasing unemployment in latin America is a good base for this region as a unit of developing countries.

To conclude, according to this chart the problem of unemployment all over the world is not really sharp because the main trend is positive.
