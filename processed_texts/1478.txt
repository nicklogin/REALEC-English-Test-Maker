Musicians and film producers lose a big <<amount**T1**lex_item_choice**None**4**part>> of money every year because of illegal pirate copies. Everybody knows that copying and sharing such art products is a crime. Should people who break the law in such way be punished? <<In my opinion,**T2**Punctuation**None**13**In my opinion>> there is no right answer on this question. I <<cannot**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> be only agree or disagree with <<this option**T4**Absence_explanation**None**2**it>>.

<<On the one hand,**T5**Punctuation**None**15**On the one hand>> we have producers, whose <<income**T9**lex_item_choice**None**7**payment>> <<depends on**T6**lex_item_choice**None**12**addicts from>> <<how many people buy their products**T7**Confusion_of_structures**None**40**number of people, who buy their products>>. For example, some producer has a film. If every person would watch the film in an illegal way, for example, download in from torrent sites, the producer will have no <<money.**T10**Punctuation**None**6**money,>> Secondly, when people <<copy**T11**Tense_form**None**7**copying>> and download films <<from the Internet**T12**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>>, they break author’s rights. In this case people should be punished.

On the other hand, we have people<< who do not have enough money to pay for films**T15**Defining**None**47**, who do not have enough money to pay for films>>. Imagine that there is <<a man**T16**Articles**None**8**some man>><< who loves cinema art with all of his heart**T17**Defining**None**44**, who loves cinema art with all of his heart>>. He wants to watch every film from <<the Cannes festival**T19**Articles**None**15**Cannes festival>>, but <<it is**T20**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> not possible<< because**T21**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> there are too many films and he <<cannot**T22**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> pay for <<each film**T23**Absence_explanation**None**4**each>>, because, in my opinion, <<a ticket's price**T24**Articles**None**14**ticket’s price>> is very high. <<That is**T25**Inappropriate_register**None**6**That’s>> why this man download <<films**T26**Noun_number**None**4**film>> from <<the Internet**T27**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. It will be not fair to punish him<< because**T28**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> he just <<does**T29**Tense_form**None**5**doing>> something that makes him happy.

In conclusion, I want to say that nowadays we <<face**T30**Tense_choice**None**5**faced>> a real problem with illegal pirate copies. I believe that there will be found a solution of <<this**T31**Ref_device**None**5**these>> problem <<that wil help**T32**Confusion_of_structures**None**7**to make>> producers not to lose their money because of <<pirate copies thieves**T33**Spelling**None**19**pirate-copies-thief>> and for <<art adorers**T34**Spelling**None**11**art-adorers>> not to break the law.
