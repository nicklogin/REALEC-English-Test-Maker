According to <<the chart**T1**Articles**None**7**a chart>> we can get the information about goods: <<first,**T3**Punctuation**None**5**first>> we can see the frequently transported goods <<in**T2**Category_confusion**None**3**but>> each sphere. By analysing the chart we can say that most of the goods listed in <<the**T4**Spelling**None**2**te>> chart <<were transported**T5**Voice**None**11**transported>> by road. <<On the other hand,**T6**Punctuation**None**17**On the other hand>> machinery and metals are more popular to transport by rail. <<Machinery were**T8**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**Machinery>> more than 12% transported by rail while <<by road it has**T7**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**by road>> only 2. Metals on the 24% <<were transported**T9**Voice**None**11**transported>> by rail more than by road. Food <<, on the one hand,**T10**Punctuation**None**17**on the other hand>> is more likely to be transported by road, <<to clarify,**T11**Punctuation**None**10**to clarify>> <<it is on 20%**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**on 20%>> more than by rail. Manufactured goods are almost the same of each category. Chemicals <<are**T13**lex_item_choice**None**3**get>> more transported by road than by rail. And <<, finally,**T14**Punctuation**None**7**finally>> non-metallic minerals. In the first chart (which provides us with information about goods #DELETE#6#thatâ€™s transported by rail) we can see that <<the percentage**T16**Articles**None**10**percentage>> of non-metallic minerals <<is not**T17**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**not>> even listed, while the second chart shows that 13% of non-metallic minerals <<were transported**T18**Voice**None**11**transported>> by road.

To conclude everything that I mentioned, we can say that more than <<50%**T19**Articles**None**5**a 50%>> of all the listed goods <<were transported**T20**Tense_choice**None**15**are transported>> by road in 2008. But most of the machinery and metals <<were transported**T21**Voice**None**11**transported>> by rail. And because of the information we <<got**T22**Spelling**None**3**hot>> we can say that both <<spheres**T23**Noun_number**None**6**sphere>> of transportation are <<important in**T24**Spelling**None**11**importantin>> <<our**T25**Spelling**None**3**out>> lives.
