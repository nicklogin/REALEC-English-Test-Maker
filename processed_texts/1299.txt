The illustrations demonstrate <<the proportions**T1**Articles**None**11**proportions>> of goods transported by rail and  by road between Eastern Europe countries in 2008. 

<<Even though**T3**Punctuation**None**12**Even though,>> percentages for <<the same**T2**Articles**None**4**same>> kinds of products vary depending on <<the type**T4**Articles**None**4**type>> of transportation, manufactured goods are rather popular with approximately a quarter of the whole products’ traffic between countries in Eastern Europe. As for metals, <<they are**T5**Agreement_errors**None**4**it’s>> moved by rail roughly 3 times more often than by road. On the opposite, <<the amount**T6**Articles**None**6**amount>> of food products transported by road is about 3 times <<bigger**T7**lex_item_choice**None**6**larger>>. 

Meanwhile, there are some types of goods which are less popular to <<transport**T8**lex_item_choice**None**4**move>> between countries. For example, <<chemicals**T9**Possessive**None**9**chemicals>> transportation takes from 11 up to 16 per cent depending on the method of moving them abroad. <<The similar situation**T10**Articles**None**17**Similar situation>> can be noticed for machinery. However, the difference <<in**T11**Prepositions**None**2**of>> <<the amounts**T12**Articles**None**7**amounts>> here <<is**T13**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> exactly 6 times for various ways of transportation. 

All in all, some kinds of goods are transported abroad more often in general than others. Moreover, the method of moving them from one country of Eastern Europe to another depends on a specific type of a product.
