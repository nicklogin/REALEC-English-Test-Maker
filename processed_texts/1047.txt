Musicians and film producers can lose million’s in each year just by pirates copies. Thst’s why coping in sharing music or films is illegal. People who do this should be punished by the law. So, let’s try to discuss.

Many people often use the Internet for free downloading films, books, music and anything else. On the one hand it can brings many loses for authors and producers, because no one wants to buy albums on discs or in special resources (for example, like “Apple music for Iphones, Ipads, etc). the law cant minimize this, because it’s so hard to control people from all over the world.And it’s also not easy to stop the illegal discs sellers, because they do their affairs among the “dark selling web”. Of course, this people should be punished.

On the other hand, musician producers and film directors can also earn the money from concerts or cinematheatres. The biggest part of money they have are going from albums of filmses first representation. And I we talk about big films, they can be payded by the gouverment.

So, to conclude, it’s clear, that there no single meaning in this issue. But to my mind, Very hard unillegal law politic is wrong too. The most part of musicians are really don’t care about illegal salers. They understand the real meaning of the Freedom of the information in 21 century. But I also think, that using some special programmes for legal downloading can be compromise decision for this two sides. may be in the nearest future this big problem will be solved.
