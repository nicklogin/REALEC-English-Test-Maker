The chart shows information about how the unemployment rate has changed from 2014 to 2015. in different parts of the world.

It can be clearly seen that North Africa has the biggest unemployment rate which accounts for 12,5%. On the contrast, South Asia has the lowest level of unemployment among other selected regions. The figure is 3,9% there. The prominent feature of the data is that in regions that I have mentioned the unemployment rate remained stable and didnâ€™t change at all.

We can observe a slight decrease in the rate of unemployment in developing countries: Middle East and Latin America. There the number of unemployed people has decreased by 1,4% and 1%. On the contrary, in developed countries (in Europe) the rate of unemployment has rien by 0,4% to reach 7,9% in 2015. It is remarkable that all these changes had an effect on worldwide unemployment rate - the figure remained constant at 5,9%.
