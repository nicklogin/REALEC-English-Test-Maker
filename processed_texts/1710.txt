Nowadays the <<problem**T11**Word_choice**None**4**case>> of using illegal drugs in professional sport has become a burning issue and <<creates**T3**Agreement_errors**None**4**make>> a lot of <<concerns**T18**Spelling**None**9**concernes>>. Thus, there are widespread debates on measures against those competitors who were caught on it. Some people believe that such sportsmen should be penalized for some time, for instance, for two years, whereas others assert the necessity to ban the violaters from competing <<professionally**T13**Suffix**None**13**professionaly>> forever.
To begin with, it <<is**T19**Spelling**None**1**s>> <<worth**T20**Category_confusion**None**9**wortwhile>> <<remembering**T21**Gerund_phrase**None**11**to remember>> that professional sport is a specific lifestyle. Therefore, the decision to bond <<your**T26**Determiners**None**3**the>> life with it implies the responsibility, one <<has to**T22**Modals**None**5**might>> make an inner <<agreement**T14**Spelling**None**9**agreament>> with the rules of this society. This <<provokes**T9**Agreement_errors**None**7**provoke>> the idea that the athletes <<, who have been caught,**T15**Defining**None**6**caught>>, should be banned from participating in <<competitions**T10**Articles**None**15**the competitons>> for the rest of their lives. Virtually, this opinion is based on the term of "professional honesty" that is <<extremely**T12**Spelling**None**8**extremly>> significant in any professional area.
Otherwise, as the famous quote <<says,**T6**Punctuation**None**4**says>> "I am <<human**T8**Word_choice**None**5**a man>> and nothing human is <<alien**T7**Word_choice**None**7**foreign>> to me". All people make mistakes and one false step might be punished but should not occur to be the <<fatality**T5**Category_confusion**None**5**fatal>> in someone's life. Even <<jails**T24**Word_choice**None**4**gads>> provide the opportunities to alter the views and undertake a <<noble**T25**Word_choice**None**5**novel>> attempt. Such a stance <<breeds**T23**Agreement_errors**None**5**breed>> the idea of a part-time ban.
To summarize, the use of illegal drugs in sport is a pertinent issue to discuss as the professional sport requires the respect to others and the responsibilities for decisions, but at the same time everybody is <<considered**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**8**reckoned>> to have a right <<to make a mistake**T27**Infinitive_constr**None**10**on mistake>>. As far as I am concerned, those punishments should be only for <<a certain amount of**T2**Word_choice**None**4**some>> time as sometimes people do not realize <<what**T3**Conjunctions**None**4**that>> they are doing on the way to their dream. To conclude, it is necessary to tackle the problem, but it would be better to do it among the people connected with this kind of activities.
