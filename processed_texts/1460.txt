Musicians and film producers every year produce hundreds and hundreds music and films, new albums, more and more new original content. But some people do not want to <<spend their own money on things**T1**Prepositions**None**32**spend their own money for things>><<things that they can get for free**T2**Punctuation**None**34**things, that they can get for free>>. They <<download**T4**lex_item_choice**None**5**takes>> films from the internet, make copies and then <<send**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**give>> all that ‘pirate materials’ to <<other**T6**Often_confused**None**7**another>> people.

I think that we <<must buy**T7**Modals**None**11**must buying>> original discs or original content in the <<Internet**T8**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. There are a lot of virtual stores like ‘Steam’, ‘Origin’, ‘Playstation Store’ that <<sell**T9**Tense_choice**None**4**sold>> games, films, music to people<< who want to support companies and their producers for their good job**T10**Defining**None**70**, who want to support companies and their producers for their good job>>.

But everybody know <<a rule**T11**Articles**None**9**what rule>>, that says ‘people who <<download**T13**Spelling**None**8**bownload>> files for free<< instead**T14**Punctuation**None**9**, instead>> of buying the original discs#DELETE#1#. Should be punished’ – is only words on paper. Because there are a lot of people all around the world<< that simply have no money**T17**Defining**None**27**, that simply have no money>> <<to buy**T18**Infinitive_constr**None**9**to buying>> <<an expensive content**T19**Articles**None**17**expensive content>> like a design program ‘3dMax’. <<If you want to buy it,**T20**Punctuation**None**21**If you want to buy it>> you must <<say 'Bye' to**T21**Prepositional_verb**None**9**say ‘Bye’>> near 130000 rubbles. Yes, you can <<use**T23**lex_item_choice**None**4**find>> the <<student's version**T22**Possessive**None**16**students version>> of this program for 3 years, but if you are not a student and you are <<a designer**T24**Articles**None**8**designer>> or you are another <<kind of user of**T26**Prepositions**None**15**kind of user in>> this program – you have to choose, you must to choose – <<to buy**T27**Infinitive_constr**None**3**buy>> this program for a lot of money or <<to download**T28**Infinitive_constr**None**8**download>> it from <<the Internet**T29**lex_item_choice**None**3**Net>> for free.
