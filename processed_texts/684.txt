Many people claim that air travel has a great influence on the pollution and global warming. This group of people believes that governments should develope some rules which could take under control unnecessary air travels such as business trips and holiday trips. However, this is a controversial issue worth discussing.

On the one hand, air vehicles such planes realy has a harmfull effect on the environment. To begin with, the gas produced by these vehicles is not environmentally friendly nowadays. In addition, due to the technology breakthrough, there are a lot of planes at the present, so, they pollute the atmosphere a lot. Moreover, there are a lot of different ways to get to any place you need. For example, lots of trains are extremely fast nowadays and have less influence on the air and global warming.

On the other hand, travelling by air is very comfortable. First, it is not waste of time, it is very speedy. Second, it could prove the economy of the country. Thirdly, it could give you a lot of wonderfull views. As an example, sitting near the window in the plane people could see beatiful lands and so on.

In conclusion, I personally believe that the governments should introduce some laws against air travel. The environment is more important than time. Hopefully, it could be proved in the near future.
