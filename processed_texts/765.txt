The bar chart shows how many people of different age use such social networks as Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn in the USA.

It can be seen from the chart that social networks for entertaining are more popular among young people, meanwhile LinkedIn, which is used for looking for job, is used more by people of middle age and older.

Taking into consideration each separate network following things could be mentioned. Firstly, only about 22 per cent of people from 18 to 29 use it and it's the same for people, who are over 60. Moreover, the percentage doesn't rise significantly over the middle age group, who are people from 30-49 and 50-64, and is only about 30 per cent. Secondly, there is a huge amount of Facebook users in the US and it reached almost 90 per cent, and the lowest point is the percentage of pensioners that is about 56 per cent. The same tendency can be noticed about Instagram, that it's more used among 18-29 years old people and the older the group age is the less the amount of people using it.
Overall, it can be concluded that social networks for enjoying your time are more usable than networks for working.
