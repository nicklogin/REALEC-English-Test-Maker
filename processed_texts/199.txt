Nowadays lots of people <<are keen**T293**Category_confusion**None**4**keen>> on watching films and listening to music via <<Internet**T1**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> rather than going to the cinemas or buying discs. <<As a result,**T292**Punctuation**None**11**As a result>> producers and musicians do not get the whole profit. That is why governments support them and the police catch “pirates” and “downloaders”.
<<In my opinion,**T4**Punctuation**None**13**In my opinion>> these laws are essential to support <<people's**T5**Possessive**None**6**people>> rights and work. Firstly, pirates sell copies and get <<a part**T6**Articles**None**4**part>> of creators’ profit. It means that they steal someone’s work <<, which can be considered as a theft**T7**Punctuation**None**34**which can be considered as a theft>>. Secondly, pirates and downloaders do not respect others’ work. Finally, people usually offer <<low-quality**T9**lex_part_choice**None**11**bad quality>> copies which can <<make a bad impression on**T295**Word_choice**None**13**badly impress>> <<the audience**T10**Articles**None**8**audience>> <<, and**T11**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<people**T297**Ref_device**None**4**they>> will not get true emotions and feelings.
Some people may argue that it is more <<convenient**T12**Spelling**None**10**convinient>> to watch films or <<listen to**T13**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> songs and melodies at home using their own devices. Also it is a great opportunity to download files on gadgets and to have an access to <<them**T299**Ref_device**None**2**it>> at any time.
These people forget that <<it is also possible**T303**Confusion_of_structures**None**22**there is also possible>> to buy legal discs <<, which they can play at home,**T14**Non_defining**None**27**which they can play at home>> or buy a special right to watch or listen whatever they want on websites. Then they will have <<a high quality product**T15**Articles**None**20**high quality product>> and will respect producers and musicians. Also they can spend their free time with someone going to concerts or to the cinema and then get more excited.
To conclude, copying and downloading pirate copies <<has**T304**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> to be considered as breaking <<the law**T306**Articles**None**3**law>>. We all should respect and support producers’ and musicians’ rights and work.
