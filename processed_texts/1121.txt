To begin with, I would like to <<say that**T1**Punctuation**None**9**say, that>> it is true<< that**T2**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> every year musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money from illegal pirate copies, but I <<cannot**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> agree<< that**T4**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> copying and sharing music or films on the <<Internet**T5**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> is bad and should be punished. <<In my opinion**T6**Prepositions**None**14**For my opinion>>, musicians and film producers should be thankful to people<< sharing**T7**Punctuation**None**9**, sharing>> <<their**T8**Spelling**None**6**theire>> products on the Internet, because they <<make**T9**Tense_choice**None**4**made>> for them a <<lot**T10**lex_item_choice**None**4**land>> of <<promotion**T11**lex_item_choice**None**10**commercial>>. It is difficult <<to disagree**T12**lex_item_choice**None**12**not to agree>><< that**T13**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> in such industry <<it does not matter**T15**Absence_comp_sent**None**15**does not matter>> if it is music, film making, art or <<something**T16**Inappropriate_register**None**4**smth>> else, PR plays one of the main role, and <<, of course,**T17**Punctuation**None**10**of course,>> much more people can learn more about your work, your movies, music tracks and so on if it is free. 

For example, many years <<ago**T18**Spelling**None**3**age>> I have watched the movie ‘<<Transporting**T19**Spelling**None**13**Transpporting>>’ <<on the Internet**T20**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>> and I loved it very much. This year #DELETE#4#then the second part of this movie appeared. I <<went to see it**T22**lex_item_choice**None**10**went on it>> to the cinema. <<Maybe**T24**Punctuation**None**7**May be,>> I <<would have never watched**T25**Conditionals**None**16**will never watch>> this movie if I <<had not found**T26**Conditionals**None**11**didn’t find>> it one day <<on the Internet**T27**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>>, so, I <<would not have gone**T29**Conditionals**None**11**woud not go>> to the cinema and, <<as**T30**Spelling**None**2**at>> the result, the producer <<would not have got**T31**Conditionals**None**10**didn’t get>> money for it.

<<The same situation is**T32**Absence_comp_sent**None**18**The same situation>> with music. If you hear good tracks <<on the Internet**T33**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>>, you will go to the concert, and musicians also will get <<their**T35**lex_item_choice**None**5**there>> money.

So, #DELETE#11#in the end, summurazing my essay, I would like to say that we live in the centery of information, and nowadays Internet is the main information source. That is why I <<do not**T37**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> think<< that**T38**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> sharing music and disks on the Internet should be punished.

And I also think<< that**T39**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> art (<<because**T40**Spelling**None**8**becauise>> movies and music <<are**T43**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> <<kinds**T42**Noun_number**Dependent_change**6**a kind>> of art) <<should not**T41**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn’t>> be commercial, that is why <<artists**T45**Articles**None**11**the artists>> should share <<them**T44**Ref_device**None**2**it>> with people.
