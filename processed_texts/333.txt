<<The Internet**T1**Articles**None**8**Internet>> is the significant <<part**T2**Spelling**None**3**pat>> of our lives today. We can do great things <<on**T6**Prepositions**None**7**through>> the <<Web**T5**Capitalisation**None**3**web>> like <<getting educated**T7**Word_choice**None**9**education>>, shopping, <<being connected**T8**Word_choice**None**10**connection>> etc<<,**T9**Punctuation**Dependent_change**1**.>> <<but**T10**Spelling**Dependent_change**3**But>> also do crimes. <<One**T11**Spelling**None**2**On>> of the most discussed problems is <<illegal content copying**T12**Articles**None**26**an illegal content copying>>. Developers lose their money <<, and**T13**Punctuation**None**3**and>> no one <<can**T14**Modals**None**5**could>> be punished.
To my mind, the problem is not as big as it is supposed to be. Authors still <<have**T15**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> their money from <<sellings**T16**Category_confusion**None**5**sells>>. They do not think that <<a person**T18**Articles**None**6**person>> who <<steals**T17**Agreement_errors**None**5**steal>> content today may like it and buy it tomorrow. People should not be punished for downloading pirate copies. It is hard to blame them for saving money<<,**T19**Punctuation**Dependent_change**1**.>> <<especially**T20**Spelling**Dependent_change**10**Especially>> in Russia where legal copies of films and video games cost too much comparing <<to**T21**Prepositions**None**4**with>> average revenues.
It is useless to ban pirate sources <<:**T22**Coherence**None**7**because>> I know at least one perfect way to decrease illegal copying. A lot of people use services like Apple Music or Spotify. They <<allow listening**T23**Verb_Gerund**None**21**allow to listening to>> music for <<a small payment**T26**Articles**None**13**small payment>> every month with <<special**T4**Spelling**None**7**speciel>> offers for students. <<Netflix, HBO, Amedia do so**T28**Standard**None**26**So do Netflix, HBO, Amedia>>. They <<have created**T29**Tense_choice**None**7**created>> striming services with <<a huge amount**T30**Articles**None**11**huge amount>> of TV-series and films for 10 <<dollars**T3**Spelling**None**7**dollors>> per month <<, that is why**T41**Punctuation**None**4**that>> millions of internet users <<have forgotten**T31**Tense_choice**None**6**forgot>> about their PirateBay accounts. So the answer is not to punish people but make <<an offer**T34**Articles**None**9**the offer>> which will <<make them refuse**T35**Verb_object_bare**None**19**make them to refuse>> from illegal copying.
Modern technologies like smartphones, tablets, Wi-Fi and mobile Internet <<allow**T36**Agreement_errors**None**6**allows>> developers and companies to create and sell content accordingly to auditoryâ€™s requests <<, and**T37**Punctuation**None**3**and>> they <<should**T38**Spelling**None**5**shoul>> use their <<opportunities**T39**lex_item_choice**None**13**possibilities>>. Judging everyone is <<a complicated and expensive process**T41**Articles**None**33**complicated and expensive process>>.
