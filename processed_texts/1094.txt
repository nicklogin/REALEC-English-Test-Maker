Some people suppose that countries must produce the food that their own population eats by itselves and should decrease import of food. I can’t agree or disagree with with this statement because our world is very complicated and we have both good and bad examples on each side. For instance there are many extreamly small countries which is very reach like Monaco, Singapure, Hong Kong and etc. Also there are many big countries which sometimes need to import food like Turkey or Egypt. Let’s see to this problem more carefully.

On the one hand there are many advantages produce enough food for population. The main advantage of this is independence of other countries. Of course, it is very good then noone can manipulate you by food prices, but also you can sell the food which your population didn’t eat. It’s OK if you can produce food by yourself, but what if not?

On the other hand there are countries which can’t produce enoght food for their population. There are two kind of this countries: first kind is poor countries which can’t produce or import enough food for population - like countries in Africa, second kind is developing or developed countries which could get enough food. We will speak about second kind. Very often countries which import food are more developed than countries which exports food. In my opinion that countries don’t need to produce food by themselves because many citizens of this countries work not in real sector, but in financial or science capacitive sectors, like in Swetzerlang.

Also there are small countries like Singapore or Macao thich haven’t enough territory to produce food. It is not very bad for this countries because lack of resources helped to increase economics in there.

To sum up, there isn’t one solution of food import problem for all countries. The solution depends on many factors and something which could be good for Russia at the same time could be bad for Hong Kong.
