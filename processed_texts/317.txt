Nowadays, the problem of media piracy <<have become**T1**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> abnormally widespread. It is called one of the most important problems <<among**T2**Spelling**None**5**amond>> other problems that are related to <<private**T3**Category_confusion**None**7**privacy>> policy and information access on the Internet. However, <<even if this is a problem which authors face quite often**T5**Abs_comp_clause**None**53**even if this a problem which authors face quite often>>, most of them earn a lot of <<money**T6**Spelling**None**4**mony>> with concerts they give. And the sum pirates can <<get**T7**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**3**bit>> off from stealing someone’s music cannot damage producor’s or author’s budget in that <<gross**T9**Spelling**None**4**gros>> harmful way <<mass media**T10**Spelling**None**9**massmedia>> <<show**T11**Agreement_errors**None**5**shows>> us.
Actually, common citizens do not even know about piracy and how it <<affects**T12**Transitive**None**10**affects on>> <<artists**T13**Derivation**None**7**artsmen>>. They only want to get free content from <<the Internet**T14**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. <<In this case,**T15**Punctuation**None**12**In this case>> <<the problem**T16**Articles**None**9**a problem>> is <<in**T17**Prepositions**None**6**inside>> human’s mentality. Unfortunately, not all of us are ready to show full respect to a property of another person. So, to solve this case, a clarification is needed, as much as a new strict law that can provide <<security**T18**lex_item_choice**None**6**safety>> for authors. People must be told<< how**T19**Punctuation**None**5**, how>> hard author’s work is. Speaking about safety of data, we must remember it should be <<controlled**T29**lex_item_choice**None**8**banished>> with an administration issues of the law. Maybe, the penalty money can serve a better idea – to find new projects from <<great**T20**Spelling**None**5**grate>> masters of <<Arts**T21**Noun_number**None**3**Art>>. This must be counted as an option for users to support authors. <<As it turned out**T22**Abs_comp_clause**None**13**As turned out>>, the public does not want to pay for musician’s or writer’s work, but also feels enraged when <<the government**T26**Articles**None**9**goverment>> tries to protect author’s property. To provide more calm change from free on-line downloads to on-line purchases for music, we must pay attention to an hyperbolization of the amount of producer’s lost money<< and**T28**Punctuation**None**5**, and>> solve a problem softly and without rush. People must be prepared to new laws by social media or social <<advertising**T25**Often_confused**None**13**advertisement>> <<which**T26**Spelling**None**4**wich>> shows the value of author’s intellectual work.
