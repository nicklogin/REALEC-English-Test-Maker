The use of illegal drugs in sport is a topic of many heated debates all around the globe nowadays. There are two different <<solutions**T386**Noun_number**None**8**solution>> to <<the problem**T387**Articles**None**7**problem>> of this illegal action - either banning athletes for a limited period of time from their sport <<career**T412**Spelling**None**7**carrier>>, or banning them from it <<forever**T388**lex_item_choice**None**11**permanently>>. In this essay I will examine both these solutions and provide my point of view.
First of all, I can absolutely see the source of desire to ban such athletes completely from their professional field. Sport is not supposed to be just about competitions, scores and Pepsi ads with recognizable <<athletes**T389**Spelling**None**7**athlets>>. The core of every sport, whether it is <<figure skating**T390**Spelling**None**14**figure-skating>> or football, is its spirit. <<The spirit of sport**T391**Articles**None**15**Spirit of sport>>, <<the spirit**T392**Articles**None**6**spirit>> of competition, which is a <<means**T393**Spelling**None**4**mean>> to <<provide people with a test**T395**Prepositional_verb**None**21**provide people a test>> of their abilities. Achievements in <<such a competition**T396**Articles**None**16**such competition>> is a result of true passion and hard work. Illegal drugs alter the condition of <<the competition**T397**Articles**None**11**competition>> to the point where your spirit and passion do not matter. <<Therefore**T398**Punctuation**None**9**Therefore>> people who use them are offensive to the very concept of <<professional**T399**Spelling**None**12**proffesional>> sport and should not be allowed to it at all.
On the other hand, such firm punishment, which can have drastic effect on <<a person**T400**Articles**None**6**person>>'s life, can be considered too arbitrary. All people make mistakes at some points of their <<life**T401**Spelling**None**4**live>>. It is important for us not to dwell on them and move on. Perhaps, reconsider our values. <<Athletes**T402**Spelling**None**6**Athets>> are people too, however inhumane their abilities may seem. They also make mistakes and it is important to <<provide them with room**T403**Prepositional_verb**None**17**provide them room>> for correcting their mistakes, as it is with any other human being. And banning them for a limited period is exactly the room for correcting mistakes and detoxicating - both physically and mentally.
Overall, I believe both approaches to solution of <<the problem**T404**Articles**None**7**problem>> of use of illegal drugs should be <<taken into consideration**T405**lex_part_choice**None**22**taken in consideration>> when developing <<legislation**T413**Spelling**None**11**ligislation>> regarding this issue. However, we should pay the closest attention to <<the fate and the personality**T407**Articles**None**20**fate and personality>> of <<a particular athlete**T406**Articles**None**18**particular athlete>>, taking into account his or her intentions. <<An individual approach**T409**Articles**None**19**Individual approach>> is <<necessary**T410**Category_confusion**None**9**necessity>> in every issue that affects <<human beings**T408**Spelling**None**12**human-beings>>.
