<<There is no doubt that nowadays industry of media has gained great popularity all over the world.**T2**Punctuation**None**100**There is no doubt that nowadays industry of media has gained the great popularity all over the world>> Everyone wants to watch movies, series and listen to music <<, but**T307**Punctuation**None**3**but>> #DELETE#3#far not everyone wants to pay for it. Some people tend to think that people who <<are involved**T309**Word_choice**Dependent_change**9**connected>> <<in**T323**Prepositions**Dependent_change**4**with>> copying, saving and sharing illegal copies should be <<prosecuted**T310**Word_choice**None**18**imposed punishment>>. I completely disagree with this point of view.
Firstly, rapid spreading of free copies of films and music is one of the steps to the world where <<cultural**T4**Category_confusion**None**7**culture>> <<achievement**T3**lex_item_choice**None**11**destination>> of the planet is <<accessible**T311**lex_item_choice**None**10**acceptable>> to everyone. Free access to music and films #DELETE#2#it is a good chance to enjoy <<beauty**T5**Suffix**None**10**beautiness>>, improve <<one's taste**T6**Determiners**None**5**taste>> and become <<better**T313**lex_item_choice**None**4**more>> educated even <<for**T7**Spelling**None**3**foe>> those who can’t afford to go to <<the cinema**T26**Noun_number**None**7**cinemas>>, concert halls <<or**T315**Conjunctions**None**3**and>> buy CDs or <<DVDs**T10**Spelling**None**4**DWDs>>.
The second argument is that trying to catch <<all people**T318**Absence_comp_colloc**None**3**all>> who <<are**T316**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> connected with illegal copies of films and music #DELETE#2#it is a <<waste**T11**Category_confusion**None**7**wasting>> of time and money. <<On**T12**Prepositions**None**2**In>> the modern <<Internet**T13**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> “pirates” can easily hide themselves. File that was deleted will <<be recovered**T14**Voice**None**10**be recover>> again soon. Much more productive is to make <<the payment**T15**Articles**None**7**payment>> for <<the Internet**T26**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> a little #DELETE#3#bit higher and send <<a part**T18**Articles**None**4**part>> of this money to producers and musicians. <<Moreover,**T19**Punctuation**None**8**Moreover>> producers of mass media still receive <<a huge amount**T20**Articles**None**11**huge amount>> of money from films in cinemas and big concerts of musicians. <<People don't stop bringing them money.**T21**Standard**None**37**People don’t stop bringing money them>>.
<<To draw a conclusion,**T22**Punctuation**None**20**To draw a conclusion>> I should say that <<the world**T320**Articles**None**5**world>> <<receives**T23**Agreement_errors**None**7**receive>> from spreading free copies of media products more than <<it loses from it**T26**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**loses>>. Producers still <<make**T27**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**2**go>> #DELETE#2#in profit, but people have more access to <<cultural**T322**Category_confusion**None**7**culture>> <<achievement**T26**lex_item_choice**None**11**destination>>.
