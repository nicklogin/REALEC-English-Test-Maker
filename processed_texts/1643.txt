The <<bar chart**T2**Spelling**None**9**bar-chart>> illustrates the situation on the book market field for four different countries that was in 2014 and <<continued**T3**Tense_choice**None**7**will be>> <<for**T4**Prepositional_verb**None**2**in>> the next four years. We can see on the graph how much money each country <<spent**T5**Tense_choice**None**6**spends>> on producing eBook and print book.
According to the <<bar chart,**T21**Punctuation**None**9**bar chart>> USA <<was**T8**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> a leader in book printing<< -**T9**Punctuation**None**1**,>> because they <<spent**T10**Tense_choice**None**5**spend>> 10,5 billion dollars on print books.
The country that <<has read**T13**Tense_choice**None**5**reads>> the least <<number**T12**Spelling**None**7**noumber>> of printed books <<was**T14**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> the UK, <<in spite**T11**Spelling**None**7**inspite>> of that fact the difference between usage of eBooks and printed ones <<was**T16**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> the smallest and <<was equal**T21**Tense_choice**None**6**equals>> only 0,8 percent. This chart shows us that all countries: USA, Germany, China, and even UK will spend more money on eBook in the future. 
They also will reduce spendings on print book, except Germany whose spendings will not change at all as we could see on the chart. The last main point is that <<China**T18**Spelling**None**5**Chine>> <<spent**T19**Tense_choice**None**6**spends>> money on eBooks less than other <<countries,**T20**Punctuation**None**9**countries>> and this amount of money <<was**T21**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> more than 10 times smaller than in the USA.
