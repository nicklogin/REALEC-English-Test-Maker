The modern society <<faces**T364**Verb_pattern**None**14**is facing with>> crimes every day and <<does**T382**Tense_form**None**2**do>> not even notice this fact.
Moreover, the police sometimes is not that reliable as we really want it to be. So, how can we reduce the amount of crimes?
Some people claim that giving longer prison sentences will be he<<helpful.

For instance, there are a lot of junkies in hip-hop culture that were in prison and after their revealing be<<began**T370**Tense_choice**None**5**begin>>o do it even more often, sometimes these drug dealers ar<<make**T371**Tense_choice**None**10**are making>>heir buisness even in prison.

On the other hand, there are some people who think in other way. They believe that there are alternative ways of dicr<<decreasing**T372**Spelling**None**10**dicreesing>>mes in our society. To my mind, these people are right.
What can we do with these prisoners. Of course, there are a<<have always been**T374**Tense_form**None**15**are always been>>al works and other ways to make these people obey the law.
