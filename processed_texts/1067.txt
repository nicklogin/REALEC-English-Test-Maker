Some people think that watching movies or listening to music on the Internet is a crime, because authors do not get money for their work. However, the main part of the socity keeps downloading music and films from the Internet.

On the one hand, you can say that such people are totally wrong. First of all, a fee for a legal product is relativelly low, so anybody can pay it. Besides, the money earned by song of film goes not to one person, but spreds between members of a big working team, such as actors, producers, directors, musicians, dancers, designers, operators and so on. Moreover, costumes, scenery and background for a movie, music video or sometimes a concert are also have itâ€™s own price, which is payed from money public give for the finished product. In result, when people make pirate copies, companies are left with a huge lack of money and can even be closed which makes pirating a theft.

On the other hand, ordinary people will disagree with that. One of the reasons is that companies can also get money from adverticement, worldtours or showing their movies in cinema. Comparing to that, money payed for downloading from the Internet just do not play any role.

In addition, when public really like the product, it will finally get all the money it owns, because people will want to see the star alive in the concerts or watch the movie on a big screen in cinema, so free downloading can actually bring a good income to companies.

To sum up, I strongly believe that making illegal pirate copies is a bad thing. The main reason for that is because it is harmful to the entertainming culture all in all. The money peope do not pay for downloading could be used to make new interesting movies and music. Trueth be hold, I think that if you want expand your horizons by watching good films or listening to music, it is crucial to pay authors what they deserve.
