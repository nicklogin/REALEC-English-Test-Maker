Some people think, that it is a normal to use illegal drugs. Some people not think it. Sometimes athletes using illegal drags, and they is a ban from competing professionally for a limited period. In my opinion it is normal period for athlets understand him mistake.
People; who think, that such athletes should be banned from competing professionally for the rest of their life make a mistake. For Example, Alex Cabucov - ex-footballer was ban from nationale competition, becous he using illegal drags. In him interwue, he was talk, about dameged him life. For a tree years he can not play in football in him team. What was been with him, if he should be banned for the rest of his life?
Two years it is very good period for reabelitation athlets health and powers. All drags come out from the body. For illustration this argument, I should be say about my brother, who plaed in basketball bin competing professionally. He used illegal drags - mefinin. It is drag do your body more powery. My brothe was banned from competion for a limited period - one year. After this moment from first to therd month he doing test for drugs. After therd mounth him body was clear.
In conclution, I want to say that a limited period it is true, becous most athlets all their life doing sport. If they ban from competing professionally for the rest of their lives, they could not doing other. And of cours some years it is more then good period for body cleaning.
