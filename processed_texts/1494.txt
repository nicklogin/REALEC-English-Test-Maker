Nowadays, the theam drugs consumption leads to heated dealates. There are two view on this problem. Some people think that the athlets who use illegal drugs shouldn't participate in competion during some period of time, the opponents insists that using of drugs should be punished more radically, so the athlets should be banned forever.
On the other hand, the first idea is based on humanity. Everyone can make a mistake even an athlet. But it seems that this measure will work only if the sportsmen really appologise for his action. If he do not he will use drugs in future more carafully and we have a negative influence on a copetition.
That is why for the another hand, the eternal ban will be better. It will protect all pure athlets. Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages in this method, because it do not include the mistake of RUADA or other antidopping organisations. And not even the career of a good athlet can be ruin after such mistakes, but also the sport in country where he came from.
Taking everything into considaration, we can say that there are some advantages and disadvantages of this two measures of antidopping companies. But I believe that the first one is better because it can really resolve a problem with less harm for everyone.
