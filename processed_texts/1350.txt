Nowadays there are a lot of people <<who think**T1**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**think>> that using of modern technology can be very damaging for health. I personally agree with <<these**T2**Ref_device**None**4**this>> people and I think that using technology can cause a lot of health problems. The most widespread problem is that people become <<overweighted**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**8**very fat>> because they <<sit**T4**Tense_choice**None**7**sitting>> in front of <<a TV**T5**Articles**None**2**TV>>, computers and gadges all day and <<do not**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**5**donâ€™t>> do #DELETE#12#any kinds of sports.  <<The other**T8**Often_confused**None**7**Another>> problem is that children and young people can loose their <<eyesight**T9**Category_confusion**None**10**eye vision>> because they sit in front of <<a TV**T10**Articles**None**2**TV>>, gadges and computers too. <<The solution for**T11**Prepositions**None**15**The solution of>> these two problems is very simple: people must go walk <<in parks**T12**lex_item_choice**None**16**on the fresh air>>, do some <<sports**T13**Noun_number**None**5**sport>> and <<limit**T14**Tense_choice**None**7**limited>> <<the time they**T15**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**13**themselves of>> <<use**T16**Tense_choice**Dependent_change**5**using>> gadges.

There are a lot of other problems, for example, people become more selfish, rude, their attention <<to everything that surrounds them**T17**Prepositions**None**34**at  everything that surrounds them>> <<becomes**T19**Tense_choice**None**12**would become>> lower but these problems are #DELETE#7#appears <<too**T21**Spelling**None**2**to>> personal and <<do not**T22**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**not>> cause any health problems.

But some people also think that using technology depends on <<the person**T23**Articles**None**6**person>> and only <<he**T24**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> watches on <<his**T25**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> health. It is <<a very strong opinion**T26**Articles**None**19**very strong opinion>> and, actually, it is #DELETE#4#very true, but <<technologies**T28**Often_confused**None**10**technology>> in our days become more and more widespread, so people <<cannot**T29**Spelling**None**7**can not>> stop #DELETE#2#of using <<them**T31**Ref_device**None**2**it>>.

<<Overall,**T32**Punctuation**None**7**Overall>> there are a lot of problems with health which <<are**T33**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> caused by <<overusing**T34**lex_item_choice**None**5**using>> of <<technologies**T35**Often_confused**None**10**technology>>, but <<the solution**T36**Articles**None**8**solution>> <<for them**T37**Prepositions**None**7**of them>> is very simle.
