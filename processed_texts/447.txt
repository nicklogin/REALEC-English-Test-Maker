The bar chart illustrates the proportion of the usage of three social networks by American people of four different groups.
As it can be clearly seen from the chart, Facebook is the most popular site. Almost 90 per cent of young people of the age 18-29 and 73 per cent of those surveyed who are 30-49 years old use this social network. It is also widely used by respondents who are older than 50: more than a half of people of age groups of 50-64 and 65+ are active users of Facebook.
