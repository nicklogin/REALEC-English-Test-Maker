<<Nowadays**T1**Spelling**None**7**Nowdays>> there are a lot of problems with internet pirates who steal music and films <<, which**T2**Punctuation**None**5**which>> leads to a huge losses for producers. In my opinion, such question is very <<debatable**T3**Spelling**None**9**dabatable>>. That’s why <<in my essay i will discuss**T4**Ref_device**None**21**my essay will discuss>>, firstly, why pirates should be punished, and, secondly, reasons to copy and share music or films on the <<Internet**T5**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>.
It’s agreed that copying and sharing original media content is illegal. There are several laws in Russia that try to control <<this**T6**Agreement_errors**None**5**these>> internet segment. For example, there is <<a special government organization**T8**Articles**None**31**special government organization>> that blocks resourses with illegal materials. In that case, it is not a secret that it is easier to buy a film in the official store, <<because**T9**Spelling**None**7**becouse>> <<in other way**T10**Prepositions**None**9**other way>> you lose several <<advantages**T11**Spelling**None**11**advantogies>>. With this in mind , let’s think about the quality of this content and the moral norms. As for my family, we prefer to <<watch**T12**lex_item_choice**None**3**see>> a film in the good resolution <<, and**T13**Punctuation**None**3**and>> we don’t want to break the rulers when we decide to watch a new movie or <<listen to**T14**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> new album.
On the other hand, there are some reasones to download music <<or**T15**Spelling**None**2**of>> movies from the unofficial <<site**T16**lex_item_choice**None**5**store>>. The main point is that we should take into <<account**T17**Spelling**None**6**accont>> that we live in Russia and sometimes <<there is no opportunities**T18**lex_item_choice**None**26**it closes the oppotunities>> to find an <<album**T19**Spelling**None**6**alboum>> or a movie <<by**T21**Prepositions**None**4**from>> <<a very small foreign group**T20**Articles**None**24**very small foreign group>> or with unpopular actors. For instance, <<it**T22**Capitalisation**None**2**It>> is too difficult to find The Big Bang theory in Russian stores and also in our language. In that case, we don’t have <<other**T23**Often_confused**None**7**another>> <<opportunities**T24**Spelling**None**12**oppotunities>> and have to <<download**T25**Spelling**None**8**dounload>> and translate it from unofficial resources. Moreover, these Russian laws sometimes play the role of instrument for small media producers to earn money from illegal stores or, even more often, from fan <<sites**T26**Spelling**None**5**cites>>.
To sum up, this question <<has**T27**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> different sides, but, <<in**T28**Capitalisation**None**2**In>> my opinion, there should be no illegal media at all.
