Airplanes are considered to be one of the most used and comfortable ways for travelling and work purposes. However, there are people who believe that we should decrease the number of flights in order to protect the enviroment. To my mind, many other ways to solve problem of polluting air might be found.
To begin with, air pollution is result of a f<<full of flaws**T3**Compound_word**None**7**flawful>>technology that could be improved. There was a breakthrough in the evolution of technologies recently that continues to expedite every day. Moreover, more and more companies including those that are responsible for air transfer start following the "green trend" which means that they try to adjust their products to new high ecological standarts. For example, they develop new models that need less fuel. Therefore, they attempt to present eco-friendly airplanes that might prevent enviroment from being polluted.
In addition, if the amount of travelling by air was reduced, people would likely use other means of transport more. The following increase in the usage of cars, trains and ship will escalate the situation with global pollution, << because**T4**Punctuation**None**9**, because>>hey are far from being immaculate in terms of ecology too. As a result, the reduce of flights seems to alternate one problem with another which makes a given proposal not ideal.
On the other hand, the discussed suggestion might give positive results if air companies decrease the number of flights by opening more direct destinations. For example, less dangerous fuel would be needed if it was possible to fly directly from Moscow to any New Zealand city without a transfer in South Korea.
To sum up, the problem of air pollution has a plenty of soultions and aspects that should be taken into account. The improvement in technology and logistics seems to be the best ways<<way**T2**Noun_number**None**4**ways>>provide people with quick and eco-friendly means of transport including airplanes.
