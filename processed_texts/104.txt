We can see the chart that <<presents**T1**Tense_form**None**7**present>> to us the information <<about the development**T2**Articles**None**17**about development>> of the book market in four countries: the USA, Germany, China and the UK. We can say that <<the USA**T3**Articles**None**3**USA>> spends a lot of money on printing and making <<e-books**T4**Punctuation**None**6**ebooks>>, more than other three countries. The forecast says that total amount of books will not change by the year 2018, but the <<amount**T11**Often_confused**None**6**number>> of printed books will fall down. In Germany the tendency to print books will not change in future, <<6 billion will still be**T12**Word_order**None**23**Still 6 billion will be>> <<spent**T5**Tense_form**None**5**spend>> on it. However, the <<amount**T13**Often_confused**None**6**number>> of e-books will grow, but not <<as**T6**Often_confused**None**2**so>> much as in the USA. Changes in China will not also be so huge: a little fall in printing books and a half billion increase in ebooks. In the UK the <<amount**T14**Often_confused**None**6**number>> of <<e-books**T7**Punctuation**None**6**ebooks>> will beat the <<amount**T15**Often_confused**None**6**number>> of <<printed**T16**Adjectives**None**8**printing>> books by the year 2018, but it will not make a huge difference, just a 300 million dollars. 
So, we can say that the <<amount**T18**Often_confused**None**6**number>> of <<e-books**T8**Punctuation**None**6**ebooks>> is going to grow. Not surprisingly that someday in the future people will not print books at all.
