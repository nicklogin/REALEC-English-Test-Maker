The chart, which was given to me, illustrates the possible development of the print and eBook market from 2014 up to 2018 in four different countries.
In the USA the print book market going to fall for 3 billion US $. However the rise of eBook market is expected to reach the level of 3 billion US $, from 5,5 billion to 8,5. 
As for another country, Germany, it's print book market has big chances for not changing at all from 2014 to 2018. But Germany's eBook market is going to grow for about 0,5 billion US $.
The same situation with ebook market development is in China - 0,5 billion US $ as it is in Germany. However China's print market would decrease from 4,8 to 4,2 billion US $.
The UK is also expecting the fall of it's print market for about 0,6 billion US $. And as the ebook market of each other country from this chart, UK's one is also expected to grow. In this case from 1,8 to 2,3 billion US $.
To sum up, in all countries from the chart the ebook market is expected to grow and in almost every country the print book market loses it's positions.
