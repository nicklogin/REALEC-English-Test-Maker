The level of criminality has increased for the resent years. One of the most significant reasons of this trend is that the level of violence among young people has risen; they don't respect the law, and it's high time to explain them that crime is not good. So, parents, teachers and the government should help them.
For beggining, it is important to understand the reasons of their behaviour. First of all, there is a lot of crime on TV and the Internet. If we turn on a TV, we will see how people kill each other and other schenes of violence. Thus, young people can think that crime isn't something unusual if they see it everyday. Secondly, today young people have a feeling of freedom, and they think that a person can do whatever he wants even if it is a crime. Thirdly, maybe it is the main cause of their behaviour, today it is the high rate of unemployment in the world. So, young people don't have a job; however, they have a lot of free time and need money. As the result, a crime is a possible solution for them.
Nevertheless, the issue isn't extremly complicated. If parents explain their children the harm from the violence, they will not make crimes. In addition, speial lecturers can be created in schools to show the possible punishments for criminality. Moreover, the government should create job places for young people; it will help them to find money.
To sum up, the problem can be solved if we pay more attention for it. The support from family, school and the government will help young people to find their place in life.
