Nowadays there is a huge problem in sport, which is connected with the use of illegal drugs. Some people think, that sportsmen, who take these illegal medicines, should be disqualificated for 2 years, while others suppose that these athletes should be out of sport for the whole their lives. I'm going to discuss both these ideas and give my opinion.
Firstly, athletes who use illegal drugs before competitions are not honest with other sportsmen, their opponents. Sport must be objective, there will be no scandals in it. That is why such "not honest" sportsmen will be punished by banning them from competing professionally for a limited period of 2 years. This disqualification is not so long, because some athletes do not know that there are some illegal drugs in their medicines. For example, Russian biathlonist Ekaterina Yurieva was shocked, when the World Biathlon Federation showed her doping results, they found some illegal drugs in her blood. So, the sportsman was disqualificated for 4 years and couldn't compete with other sportsmen.
On another hand, there are many examples, when the whole national teams use illegal drugs before championships and the Olimpic Games. In such case, sport federation of one country is not honest with sport federation of others and every sportsman of the national team should be banned from competing professionally for the rest of their lives.
In my opinion, disqualification from the sport for the whole life is a very hard punishment, because for every athlete sport is his everything. I think, that disqualification for 2 years is a good punishment and it will teach sportsmen to be honest and do not use illegal drugs.
