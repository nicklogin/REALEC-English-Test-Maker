I disagree that countries only need to produce the food for their own population. We need to produce products for other countries too. 

First of all, export is a large part of budget for <<particularly**T1**Category_confusion**None**10**particular>> every country. And export of food can bring <<a lot of  profit**T2**lex_item_choice**None**11**much profit>> to the government. 

And the second, not every country can produce as much products to their own <<population.**T3**Punctuation**None**11**population,>> Rich countries can help them.

<<On the other hand**T4**Prepositions**None**17**In the other hand>>, <<a governmnet**T6**Articles**None**10**government>> <<does not**T5**Agreement_errors**None**5**don’t>> need to produce food only for export because in that case <<business**T7**Spelling**None**8**bisuness>> in that country can <<slowly go down**T8**Absence_explanation**None**11**slowly down>>.

Finally, we <<do not**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> need to remember that not every kind of food <<a country**T10**Articles**None**7**country>> can produce. Some of <<products**T11**Noun_number**None**7**product>> can be produced in only hot climate, some only in middle-term countries, and food export can <<help to take**T12**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**9**help take>> all <<kinds**T13**Category_confusion**None**7**of kind>> to all countries. 
Summarise all #DELETE#2#of that, I want to say that developing <<products**T15**Noun_number**None**7**product>> for other countries <<is**T16**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> important #DELETE#4#such and <<countries should produce**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**produce>> them to their own population.
