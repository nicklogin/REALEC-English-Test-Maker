Today we all watch the TV and again and again listen about scandals which <<are connected**T370**Voice**None**9**connected>> with drugs in sport. <<Some people**T372**Ref_device**Dependent_change**8**Somebody>> <<argue that**T374**Punctuation**None**11**argue, that>> sportsmen who use this medicines should be punished by disqualification for <<some**T371**Determiners**None**6**a some>> period (half a year, for instance). <<However,**T375**Punctuation**None**7**However>> <<other people**T376**Redundant_comp**None**20**other side of people>> think that sportsmen should be <<banned from competitions forever**T401**Standard**None**32**banned forever from competitions>>. In this essay we try to consider both points of view and make some conclusions.
First of all, sportsmen usually <<do not have**T402**Tense_form**None**8**have not>> <<a PhD**T377**Articles**None**3**PhD>> in chemistry or medicine and they do not do on their own in all about diet, food and so on. This is their personal doctor's responsibility; it means that any illegal drugs <<penetrate**T378**lex_item_choice**None**6**became>> in <<a sportsman**T403**Articles**None**9**sportsman>>'s organism often through their doctor's actions or solutions. Consequently, WADA (<<the organisation**T379**Articles**None**12**organisation>> which struggles with drugs in sport) <<has**T380**Tense_form**None**4**have>> to punish initially <<the doctor**T381**Articles**None**6**doctor>>, but not <<the sportsman**T382**Articles**None**11**a sportsman>>. Furthermore, some sportsmen are young and if we disqualify them forever, <<their**T385**Agreement_errors**None**3**his>> career will destroy and <<the world**T383**Articles**None**5**world>> lose <<a new talent**T384**Articles**None**10**new talent>>. So, the optimal decision is <<to ban**T386**Infinitive_constr**None**3**ban>> <<the sportsman**T387**Ref_device**None**3**him>> for a short period <<, which**T388**Coordinate**None**2**it>> <<will teach**T389**Tense_choice**None**7**teaches>> <<him or her**T390**Ref_device**None**3**him>> <<to be**T391**Verb_Inf**None**2**be>> more attentive.
But on the other hand a <<thought-provoking**T404**lex_item_choice**None**7**thought>> punishment is <<to ban the sportsman who has been caught for the rest of his or her life**T405**Absence_explanation**None**25**ban for the rest of live)>> <<, which can reduce the rate of sportsmen taking drugs**T406**Absence_explanation**None**42**can make the situation with drugs declined>>. It is connected with fear about their careers in <<the rest**T392**Articles**None**4**rest>> of sportsmen: if they see punishments of other people, they will try <<not to use**T407**Standard**None**10**to not use>> any drugs.
As for me, I suppose that <<a ban for a limited period has more justice than**T394**Redundant_comp**None**95**a ban for a limited period has more justice than ban for a limited period has more justice than>> disqualification for the rest of <<life**T395**Spelling**None**4**live>>. We can give <<the person**T396**Articles**None**9**to person>> <<a chance**T397**Articles**None**6**chance>> to change himself, choose a new way in professional sport without any <<preparations**T409**Prefix**None**9**preparats>> that <<are not allowed**T398**Tense_form**None**11**not allowed>> and he may understand that drugs <<do not**T408**Redundant_comp**None**10**not do not>> match with his career and that the crime does not pay.
To conclude, drugs, specially in sport, are always <<a wrong decision**T399**Articles**None**14**wrong decision>> for people who want to live without any problems with life and professional success, have to <<reject**T400**Transitive**None**11**reject from>> drugs in any form.
