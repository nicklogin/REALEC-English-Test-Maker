Nowadays there are a lot of legal drugs which are used by professional sportsmen. However, sometimes athletes use the illegal ones that lead to disqualification of the athletes for a long, but <<limited**T12**Derivation**None**8**limitted>> period of time. Some people argue that these sportsmen must be excluded from competitions for the rest of their lives. Now I try to discuss both views.
To begin with, the amount of illegal drugs has increased over time. Thus, many athletes are not aware of it and they continue to consume illegal drugs as usual <<medication**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**6**things>>. For example, we know a lot of cases <<when**T11**Linking_device**None**4**than>> the group of people who run large <<competitions**T13**Noun_number**None**9**competion>> <<pass**T14**Tense_choice**None**6**passed>> a strict law about new illegal drugs. So, many competitors cannot <<participate in**T10**Word_choice**None**5**go to>> this contest. However, others say that <<athletes**T9**Spelling**None**8**athelets>> should know about the changes of reglament.
Secondly, every situation is special. So, I think that every illegal act of <<every athlete**T7**Determiners**None**7**athlete>> should be <<considered**T8**Word_choice**None**6**looked>> separately. Nevertheless, there <<must be**T4**Redundant_comp**None**11**are must be>> one <<general**T1**Word_choice**None**5**union>> law for all sportsmen.
Thirdly, sometimes using of illegal drugs is necessary for athletes.
In conclusion, I would like to say that using of illegal drugs is <<an offense**T3**Articles**None**7**offense>>, but every case is particular. <<And in my opinion,**T1**Punctuation**None**17**And in my opinion>> athletes should not be banned from competitions for the rest of their lives.
