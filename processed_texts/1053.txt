Todays problem of illegal piratness is espessially relevant because of rapid development of high intellectual computer technologies and Internet. People who used these advantages for selfish gains should be punished. Why?

Secondly, despite on this fact that copying and sharing films by illegal methods is amoral and dishonest thing: it is also theft and must be followed by law and be punished by judges and government.

This situation made a lot of noise and scandals in media world, between employers of chanells and make harm for collaboration of BBC Chanell and First Chanell A lot of worries happened in fandom of Russia creators of TV series “Sherlock” were disappointed by this case.
