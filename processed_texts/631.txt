#DELETE#3#The two charts give information about the transportation of goods in Europe in 2008. The first chart shows the proportion of goods transported by rail and the second one by road.
H<<Having the charts compared**T2**Standard**None**26**Having compared the charts>>we can see, that m<<manufactured**T3**Spelling**None**12**manifactured>>goods are transported most of all both by rail and by road. Metals are t#DELETE#3#he most likely cargo for a train (35% of rail transportations compared to the 11% of road), while food products are preferably moved by car. Both these facts can be logically explained, metals weigh more (and machinery does as well), so trains are more suitable for them, and food expires much faster, so it can be transopted only on short distances.

To sum up, both trains and cars are importaint for transportation of goods. In some spheres, such as metal and food transportation, one dominates over the other, and in other ones, for example transporting manufactured products or chemicals, they are used eq<<equal**T6**Category_confusion**None**6**equaly>>
