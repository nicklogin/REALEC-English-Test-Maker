The charts show us how many white people and coloured people lived in the UK and in the USA in 2015. The general population and the prison population in both countries are demonstrated separately.
Like in Great Britain, America's white general population is bigger than non-white one, but the difference is not that big - 64% of white people vs. 36% of coloured people, while in the UK it is 88% vs. 12%. Moreover, America has more non-white prisoners than white ones (67% vs. 33%), while in the UK there are more white people who are in prison than coloured ones (74% vs. 26%).
On the whole, non-white population (as in prison and in general) in the USA is bigger than in the UK, while white population in America is smaller that in Great Britain.
