It is a well known fact that people today have a lot of problems with their health because of the use of computers and other #DELETE#12#technologied devices. Some of <<these**T2**Ref_device**None**4**this>> problems are very serious, some of them can be easily reduced. 

The most common problem for people nowadays is the lack of mobility. We spend a great part of the day sitting by our computers. People who work sit near the computer almost 8 hours without even getting up. Even students <<, who are supposed to be healthy and active,**T3**Non_defining**None**41**who are supposed to be healthy and active>> suffer from this problem. To reduce this issue, special exercises <<breaks**T4**Spelling**None**6**brakes>> can be introduced in <<the offices**T5**Articles**None**7**offices>>, maybe even in universities and schools. It is crucial to have some resting time during work and studying, but <<it is**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> also important for this break to be helpful physically and mentaly. And of course let’s not forget about the healthy diet a person should have and the importance of staying hidrated. 

Another problem that is discussed a lot today is peoples’ dependence on mobile phones and the <<Internet**T7**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>.  A lot of my friends agree that they <<cannot**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> live without  their phones. The constant need of communication and information stays behind that. However, I think that sometimes we need to have some <<time**T9**Spelling**None**4**tome>> for ourselves. <<Therefore,**T10**Punctuation**None**9**Therefore>> one of the ways of dealing with this particular problem would be meditation. It is an easy way to relax and <<get**T11**Spelling**None**3**ger>> yourself together, clear  your head from all the unnecessary information that comes to <<you**T12**Pronouns**None**2**us>> everyday. In my opinion, <<it**T13**Ref_device**None**4**this>> is a great habbit everybody can develop. 

To conclude, I can say that <<,despite the fact that we live in a world full of modern technologies**T14**Punctuation**None**69**despite the fact that we live in a world  full of modern technologies>>, we <<should not**T16**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn’t>> be lazy and we <<should not**T17**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn’t>> forget to take care of our personal health.
