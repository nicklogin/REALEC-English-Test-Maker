Nowadays there are many scandals in sport about illegal drug <<use**T1**Category_confusion**None**5**usage>> by <<athletes**T23**Spelling**None**8**athhetes>>. Some people are willing to solve this problem by prohibition <<to**T31**Prepositions**None**3**for>> <<athletes**T24**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> <<on competing**T3**Prepositions**None**10**to compete>> for <<a certain amount of**T25**Quantifiers**None**4**some>> time <<, while**T34**Punctuation**None**5**while>> others do not tend to excuse such froad and #DELETE#3#the want these <<athletes**T27**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> to be banned from official sport competitions forever.
<<On the one hand**T19**Articles**None**11**On one hand>>, the main aim of <<action**T20**Noun_number**None**7**actions>> taken towards the person who broke the law should be <<a complete understanding**T22**Articles**None**22**complete understanding>> by this person of his or her mistake. <<After that,**T21**Punctuation**None**10**After that>> it would be logical to give this person a second chance. The <<athletes**T18**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> who once were caught using illegal drugs due to conseption given above should be banned from competing <<professionally**T3**Suffix**None**12**professonaly>> <<only for a limited period**T30**Standard**None**25**for a limited period only>>. <<Moreover**T16**Compound_word**None**9**More over>>, modern society <<tends**T17**Agreement_errors**None**4**tend>> to solve the problem of drug <<use**T35**Category_confusion**None**5**usage>> by the competitors on the level of the users but not sistematically, including responsibility of the trainer, the whole team etc. The ploblem of illegal drugs in sport <<includes**T36**lex_item_choice**None**10**consist of>> the whole competition system and people who work there. Therefore, the banning of one <<athlete**T37**Noun_number**None**8**athletes>> for the rest of his or her life without the investigation of the whole system would be quite cruel because his or her actions could have been made due to external influence but not only athlete's internal problems.
On the other hand, people who are eager to <<prohibit**T13**Spelling**None**9**prohibite>> illegal drug users <<from participating in sport competitions**T14**Prepositions**None**40**from participating in sport competitions>> forever <<also have a point**T38**Conjunctions**None**16**have a point too>>. First of all, nobody can be sure that an <<athlete**T12**Spelling**None**8**athelete>> who used drugs once is not going to use it again. If the main reason for it is that the <<athlete**T7**Spelling**None**8**athelete>> is insecure about <<his**T8**Pronouns**None**2**he>> or her abilities in sport then this problem cannot be solved by ban for <<a limited**T41**Quantifiers**None**4**some>> period of time<< ; moreover,**T11**Punctuation**None**11**, moreover,>> it can be solved only by <<a psychologist**T10**Articles**None**11**phycologist>>. The most common fear behind such position <<consists**T4**Agreement_errors**None**7**consist>> of the opinion that the <<athlete**T5**Spelling**None**8**athelete>> who has serious phycological problems cannot compete and <<, obviously, it makes sense**T6**Standard**None**24**it makes sense obviously>>. In my opinion, phycological problems can be solved anyway, and the athlete who made a mistake of using illegal drugs can be taken back to sport.
<<In conclusion,**T3**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I would like to say that the problem of drugs in sport is very relevant but despite some advantages of radical banning drug users from sport forever, I think that any person should be given a second chance.
