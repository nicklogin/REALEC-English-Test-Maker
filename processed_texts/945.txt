It was very surprising to me that today young people tend to violate the law more often than several decades ago. Obviously, increasing <<rates**T9**lex_item_choice**None**6**scores>> of crimes are making usual life more dangerous for everybody and thus, this <<quantity**T10**lex_item_choice**None**6**number>> of crimes <<must**T11**lex_item_choice**None**6**should>> be decreased by <<actions of the society**T12**Word_order**None**19**the society actions>>. But firstly we should answer questions how such a situation could <<become**T1**lex_item_choice**None**2**be>> possible and whether #DELETE#3#the goverments are guilty for this.
In my opinion, one of the most important <<reasons**T3**Agreement_errors**None**6**reason>> why children <<commit**T4**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> so many crimes is the regulation of #DELETE#3#the child labour. Nowadays, it's quite hard for children to get some <<uncomplicated**T5**Word_choice**None**20**not very complicated>> job. In order to defend children from <<exploitation**T25**Word_choice**None**21**users of their labour>>, <<governments**T26**Spelling**None**10**goverments>> have closed the majority of opportunities to work for children. On the other hand, there is <<another**T6**Determiners**None**10**an another>> potential reason. #DELETE#3#The law violation is often considered #DELETE#2#by something brave at teenagers’ society. Frankly speaking, it is very <<urgent**T32**lex_item_choice**None**6**actual>> for ex-USSR <<countries.**T31**Punctuation**None**9**countries>>
Therefore, there are several ways to decrease young <<people's**T14**Possessive**None**6**people>> crime rates. These ways do not exclude each other. Firstly, parents should try to provide extra work for their children, then they will have extra money and no extra time for potential crimes. School institutions also should help children to find a part-time work. Secondly, somebody #DELETE#6#should <<has to teach children to respect the law**T17**Word_choice**None**22**provide respect to law>> <<None**T16**Redundant_comp**None**23**in the teenagers’ minds>>. I think that teachers <<cannot**T19**Tense_form**None**7**can not>> do very much to provide such a law respect, it is also #DELETE#7#kind of a part of <<parental**T21**Adjectives**None**6**parent>> obligations.
Actually, maybe there are more reasons of such <<an increase in the number of young people's crimes**T22**Inappropriate_register**None**12**a crime boom>>, but I think that reasons stated above are <<among**T24**Agreement_errors**None**6**one of>> the most important. That is why some actions against these reasons, sort of easing of teenagers’ employment or teaching of law respect, can strongly affect the current situation.
