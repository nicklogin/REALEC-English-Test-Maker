There is no doubt that copying and sharing films or music on the Internet is illegal. There are people who use illegal sites and methods. Others would like to punish such people and think it is a theft.
To my mind, the Internet is a huge unreal location for crime. <<Downloading**T1**Spelling**None**11**Downlowding>> music, films and other types of media is illegal nowadays. What is more, we should not forget that <<a special part**T2**Articles**None**12**special part>> of our society <<loses**T3**Agreement_errors**None**4**lose>> huge amounts of money because of pirate copies. These people do a really hard work producing films or music. This business is their <<job**T4**Often_confused**None**4**work>> <<, and**T5**Punctuation**None**3**and>> they get money for it. Why <<is it allowed**T6**Voice**None**13**does it allow>> to get their work and money <<back**T8**Spelling**None**4**bock>>? I consider, we have to punish people who <<download some files for free and use illegal methods**T9**Lack_par_constr**None**54**download some files for free and using illegal methods>>. We should appreciate hard work of media-sphere.
Some people wouldn’t like to support my position because they use illegal methods by themselves. These people think that <<the Internet**T10**Articles**None**8**Internet>> is a free zone for everybody. They don’t understand why they cannot use some sites with music or films. It is normal situation <<, and**T11**Punctuation**None**3**and>> we just have to explain them about some author’s rights and pirate copies. We should not forget about punishments. If you copy or share music or films on the Internet, you have to pay <<a fee**T12**Articles**None**3**fee>> or sometimes it can be <<a more strict punishment**T13**Articles**None**22**more strict punishment>>.
To sum up, I would like to say that <<the Internet**T14**Articles**None**8**Internet>> is a free zone but with <<borders**T15**Spelling**None**8**boerders>>. If you don’t know these <<borders**T16**Spelling**None**8**boarders>> and allow yourself to do what you want, you should be punished.
