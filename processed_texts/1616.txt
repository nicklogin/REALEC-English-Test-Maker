There is no doubt that technological progress <<manifests**T303**lex_item_choice**None**7**results>> in every sphere of our lives and improves standards of living. However, some people argue that it causes a wide range of health problems. This essay will demonstrate the consequences <<of overusing of**T291**Absence_explanation**None**2**of>> modern devices and give <<possible solutions**T290**Articles**None**22**the possible solutions>>.
To begin with, the introduction of mobile phones, computers and other electronic devices <<gave rise**T304**lex_item_choice**None**17**brings generation>> to electronic <<addiction**T292**Spelling**None**8**addition>>. That is to say, people use <<these**T305**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> devices everywhere - in order to work, teach at school, plan their free time. It <<impacts**T293**lex_item_choice**None**7**results>> badly on their eyes and leads to the <<increase in**T294**Prepositional_noun**None**11**increase of>> eye diseases <<throughout**T295**Spelling**None**8**throught>> the world. Moreover, modern technology <<eases**T296**Tense_form**None**4**ease>> <<people's life**T297**Possessive**None**14**life of people>>, so they don't have to work hard or do extra movements. This situation causes the passive style of life as the amount of movements that have to be done by people reduced greatly. It leads to overweighting and heart attacks.
However, there are some ways to <<minimize**T298**Spelling**None**8**minimaze>> the negative effect. First, it is better to control the number of time, <<spent**T299**Voice**None**8**spending>> in front of <<devices**T300**Articles**None**11**the devices>>, so that the eyes can get relaxed and renew. What is more, people should pay more attention to sport activities and be more active in <<everyday**T301**Spelling**None**9**every-day>> life. For example, they can go to the gym, walk in a park or cut down the amount of junk food.
To conclude, although modern technology provides lots of benefits, it also leads to health problems. So that in order to reduce the negative influence on health people should pay more attention to their well-being.
