Using technologies <<becomes**T1**Agreement_errors**None**6**become>> <<a more and more important part**T2**Articles**None**28**more and more important part>> of modern <<people's lives**T3**lex_item_choice**None**5**human>>. We use <<them**T4**Ref_device**None**2**it>> much more #DELETE#7#usually than before. <<However,**T6**Punctuation**None**7**However>> some people believe that <<the widespread use**T7**Articles**None**14**widespread use>> of <<technologies**T8**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>  can cause a lof of <<health**T9**Category_confusion**None**7**healthy>> problems. This essay argues with this opinion. This assay discuss this belief and some of those health <<problems**T10**Noun_number**None**7**problem>>. <<Also,**T11**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> it supplies possible solutions of these problems. 

First of all, there is no doubt that modern people spend a lot of their time near the computer: playing computer games, finding the information for education, working, etc. And we <<cannot**T12**Spelling**None**7**can not>> even imagine our life without computer. However, sitting by the computer can cause some different problems with health. For example, problems with eyes, which can be caused by <<the long-lasting looking at**T15**Articles**None**23**long-lasting looking at>> the screen. <<Also,**T16**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> everybody knows that some people prefer spending time near the computer, not doing sports. And it can be <<the reason**T17**Articles**None**8**a reason>> for many problems: <<obesity**T18**lex_item_choice**None**13**overweighting>>, problems with heart and etc. 

Further, there are a lot of technologies which help people to do their household chores. Undoubtedly, household chores is not the <<thing**T19**Spelling**None**5**think>> which most people like to do <<, but**T20**Punctuation**None**3**but>> <<if**T21**Spelling**None**1**f>> someone <<does**T22**Agreement_errors**None**2**do>> not this kind of activity, <<he**T23**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> can become lazier and move less. And it can cause the same problem as sitting near the computer for a long time (overweighting and so on). <<Also,**T24**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> people move less due to <<the delivery of**T39**Articles**None**8**delivery>> all <<goods**T25**Noun_number**None**4**good>> that they want (it is unnecessary to go to the shop to buy something), <<the opportunity**T27**Articles**None**11**opportunity>> to gel all information from the Internet (there is no need to go to the library) and etc. 

The possible solution of these problems is making sport more popular. The first step for this goal is making it cheaper, because sometimes people who want to do sport <<cannot**T29**Spelling**None**7**can not>> do it because they <<do not have**T30**Negation**None**8**have not>> enough money. Secondly, there should be less advertising of technologies and more advertising of different kinds of sports (<<the same with**T31**lex_item_choice**None**7**also of>> healthy food and healthy lifestyle). Then more people will understand that sport is <<a necessary and pleasure activity**T32**Articles**None**31**necessary and pleasure activity>>. Further, there should be more special lessons (at school, for example) where students will be <<taught**T33**Spelling**None**5**tough>> to <<have**T34**lex_item_choice**None**4**live>> a healthy lifestyle, not to spend a lot of their time using the computer. 

In conclusion, I can say that the widespread use of technology <<causes**T35**Agreement_errors**None**5**cause>> many <<health**T36**Category_confusion**None**7**healthy>> problems <<. And**T37**Punctuation**None**3**And>> the possible solution of this situation is giving people <<the knowledge**T38**Articles**None**9**knowledge>> about their health and <<a healthy lifestyle**T39**Articles**None**17**healthy lifestyle>> and making sport more popular.
