A lot of people all over the world are quite interested in sports. And most of them prefer watch it on TV, but not participate in it. And they just spend hours and hours in front of the TV.
And I am definitely agreed that this is a waste of time.And there are a lot of reasons which can improve it.
First of all, sport can really help people with their health. While people do the exercises all their organs are working. It is possible to do exercises outside, which is better. Moreover, sport helps not only our physical health, but also physiological.
It can help to cope with everyday stress. Also sport activities may become the reason of new meetings, because the same interests bring people together.
On the other hand, there are a lot of people who just do not want to participate in any kinds of sport, and it their decision. But, never the less, it is possible to spend free hours much more interesting than just watching sports on TV. For example, reading, hiking, travelling.
Also I need to say, that I do not want to despite the fact that a lot of people just like watch different kinds of sport on TV, and it is not so bad activity. People also can watch it with their friends. But if we are talking about hours in front of the TV, I cannot change my opinion that it is just a waste of time.
To sum up, I can say, that there are a lot of people all over the world, and they all have different views and opinions, and it is normal. And this issue also has its pros and cons.
