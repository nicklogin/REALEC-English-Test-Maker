The question of crime has disturbed humanity all along <<its**T1**Pronouns**None**4**it's>> history. Philosophy and religion have been <<discussing**T3**Spelling**None**9**discusing>> if crime can be linked to sin, while <<politicians**T4**Spelling**None**11**politisians>> have tried different ways of dealing with it, starting with simply killing the criminal and <<then**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**than>> inventing <<an extensive system**T17**Articles**None**16**extensive system>> of prisons.

Not so long ago the question of death sentence was debated furiosly, but nowadays execution looks like at<<atrocity**T18**Spelling**None**9**attrocity>>o most people. It brings us to the question of ef<<efficiency**T22**Derivation**None**10**efficiancy>>f prisons. As soon as they are our own solution, they ought to be helpful, aren't they?
Prisons of Wes<<the Western world**T19**Articles**None**13**Western world>>e<<tend**T6**Voice**None**8**are tend>> bec<<become**T7**Infinitive_constr**None**8**becoming>>re and more comfortable, pro<<providing prisoners with**T8**Prepositions**None**19**providing prisoners>>levision, books, some min<<mind-occypuing**T20**Spelling**None**14**mind-occupaing>>r<<activity**T21**lex_item_choice**None**4**work>> do, good food and comfortable sleeping pla<<places**T23**Noun_number**None**5**place>>ritics argue that prisoners' conditions are too good, as they are living on citizens' taxes sometimes better than those citizens themselves. Can this hotel-like system be considered a punishement that leads to redemption? Some say that prison sentence must be as long as possible to force prisoners to oth<<overthink**T15**Spelling**None**13**otherthinking>>eir behavior and evil deeds in such comfy conditions. They believe that the fear of long enough sentence will prevent people from commiting crimes as the risk will be not worth it.

But such people are not looking at the core. They do not consider reasons that push people to crime. Most <<Most people**T11**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**Most>>rison are sentenced for robbery, drugs<<drug using**T12**lex_part_choice**None**5**drugs>>estic violence. All these crimes are cause<<mainly caused**T24**Standard**None**13**caused mainly>>oor economical and social conditions. It is very convinient for polit<<politicians**T13**Spelling**None**10**politisans>>ccuse poor people and portray them as maniacs who threaten wealthy middle class. I do believe that the best way to prevent crime is to work on people's level<<quality**T25**lex_item_choice**None**5**level>>ife, spend more many <<money**T14**Spelling**None**4**many>>on army but on education and social serve<<services**T15**Spelling**None**8**serveses>> can help people in crisis.
