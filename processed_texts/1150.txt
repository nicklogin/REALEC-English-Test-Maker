There is no secret that many people all over the world copy and share music and films on the Internet instead of buying them. <<That is**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**6**That’s>> why musicians and producers lose huge amounts of money per year.

On the one hand, there is <<a huge amount of people**T2**Articles**None**21**huge amount of people>> who <<cannot**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> buy films or music, such as students, elderly <<men**T5**Noun_number**None**3**man>> and women, poor males and females, children. But they want to get an education<<, for example,**T6**Punctuation**None**13**, for example>> in films school, or just see education <<movies**T7**Noun_number**None**5**movie>>. These groups of people <<just do not able**T8**Confusion_of_structures**None**20**just have no ability>> to pay for these things. For instance, Andry Tarkovskiy grow up in <<a poor family**T9**Articles**None**11**poor family>>, but he had <<not**T10**Spelling**None**2**no>> enough money to watch movies, <<that is**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**6**that’s>> why he <<tried**T12**Tense_choice**None**5**tries>> to do it without <<a payment**T13**Articles**None**7**payment>>. <<Another**T14**Often_confused**None**9**The other>> example is our grandparents from the Sovet Union. They copied films and saw abroad films, because they were very interested in other <<cultures**T15**Noun_number**None**7**culture>>. 

<<On the other hand**T16**Articles**None**13**On other hand>>, producers, musicians, costume designers <<make**T17**Tense_choice**None**4**made>> <<great products**T18**Articles**None**18**the great products>>. They <<spend**T20**Tense_choice**None**5**spent>> their time on making <<films**T21**Noun_number**None**4**film>> or <<songs**T22**Noun_number**None**4**song>>, so they <<should be**T23**Modals**None**6**can be>> payed. When you have done <<some work**T24**lex_item_choice**None**8**the work>> it is normally to get money for it. But in this occasion <<many**T26**lex_item_choice**None**8**a lot of>> people <<do**T25**Agreement_errors**None**4**does>> not do it, so the expences cannon be covered. For example, if someone <<steals**T27**Agreement_errors**None**5**steal>> products from the shop, this person must be punished because it is breaking the law. For instance,  when the Samsung <<stole**T28**Spelling**None**5**steak>> the design of new <<Iphones**T29**Noun_number**None**6**Iphone>> and produced nearly the same <<phones**T30**Spelling**None**6**phines>>, the Iphone company <<submited**T31**Tense_choice**None**6**submit>> in court and the Samsung payed a huge amount of money.

To sum up, in my opinion, <<a person**T32**Articles**None**6**person>> <<who is**T33**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**who>> copying or sharing music or films should be punished, but not arrested. I guess it is normal to consist them to pay <<a fee**T34**Articles**None**3**fee>>.
