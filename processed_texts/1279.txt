The pie charts below demonstrate the amount of transportations for 6 types of goods by two means of transport in the countries of Eastern Europe in 2008. Overall, they revealed that trains are used usually for the <<delivery**T1**Spelling**None**11**deliverment>> of heavy goods. 

To begin, according to the diagrams, the biggest part of goods moved by trains is metals, 35%, while the highest percentage of goods transported by road refers to the food products, 30%<<.**T2**Punctuation**None**1**>>> However, the second pie chart shows that the number for manufactured goods for road transportation is close to <<food products' proportion**T3**Absence_explanation**None**4**food>>, 28%. Also, machinery takes <<the last place**T4**Absence_explanation**None**8**the last>> <<in**T6**Prepositions**None**2**of>> <<the transportation**T7**Articles**None**14**transportation>> by road, only 2%, while it is <<in the third place**T9**Absence_explanation**None**7**the 3rd>> in rating for <<the rail transportation**T8**Absence_explanation**None**4**rail>>, 12%. It should be noted that the figures for manufactured goods are almost the same #DELETE#17#in the percentage for both means of transport, with only 3% more for road transportations. 

All in all, the main trend for rail is to serve for transportation of hard or heavy goods like metals or machinery, while <<other**T11**Spelling**None**6**others>> types of good are used to be moved by the road.
