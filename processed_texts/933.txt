Nowadays a lot of people think that technology increases the number of health problems because the use of it becomes very widespread all over the world. The essay will discuss firstly, the problems that are connected with health, and, secondly, the solutions which can <<solve**T1**lex_item_choice**None**6**decide>> these problems
To begin with, the most significant problem connected with the use of technology is <<that**T2**Spelling**None**3**hat>> the ultraviolette destroys the humans' immune system. For example, if a person is sitting with the computer for the whole day and playing some games, or sitting on the Internet, then he/she will have a headache, the vision will be much worse. Moreover, there is a problem with radiation. For example, the phones which people use or the electronic resources, where they bake can also bring a harm on health. The radiation can increase the number of such deases as cancer.
To reduce such problems the <<scientists**T3**Spelling**None**9**scietists>> and innovators should get them into the account. Firstly, they should produce such technologies that will have much less <<radiation**T4**Spelling**None**8**raiation>>, that will not be so harmful for people's health. Secondly, they have to get in an account that people spend a lot of time with these technologies, for example, phone. Thirdly, people should put some rules in using such technologies <<themselves**T5**Spelling**None**11**theirselves>>, because nobody will <<control**T6**lex_item_choice**None**10**follow for>> them and <<the**T7**Determiners**None**4**that>> technologies they use. And finally, the government have to put some patents on the most harmful technologies.
To conclude, there are a lot of technologies that harm people's health, but this problem can be reduced<< F. Baykov**T8**suggestion**None**1**.>>
