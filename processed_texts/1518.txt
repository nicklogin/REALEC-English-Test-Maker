Nowadays, the cheeting in sport connecting with illegal drugs is becoming widespread problem. This essay has a purpose to deal with the question "should athlets, who used drugs, be isolated from the competitons forever or for a limited period of time?" Before provide my own opinion, I intend to discuss both views on this issue.
The first point of view is that atleth should not be punnished forever, and the punishement as limited period is enough. Some sportsmens realised their mistakes and stoped cheeting. For instance, there was a runner, who was caught in the international competiotion, but he underwent a course of reabilitation and now he don't use any drugs.
The other opinion is that the atleth should be banned from competing proffessionally for the rest of their lives. Some people never changes and can't understand their own mistakes. This kind of people don't wont be fair. For example, their was a case in local competion. A jumper was caught using illegal medicaments. Therefore, She was banned from competion for two years. However, when she returned to proffesion sport, she was caught again.
However, it is my opinion that people should not be very sever by judjing these athlets. I also suppose, that four years is enough for them to realise their mistakes.
To sum up, there is several views on this question. Some people believe that time limited bann is enough, others think that is not. Although, there are athlets who will be cheeting forever inspite of bann limited punishment. I personally suppose that four year isolation from proffesional competion is enough for them to realise their mistakes.
