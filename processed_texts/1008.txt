The bar graph depicts a comparison of unemployment levels in several parts of the world. It illustrates changings in 2014 and 2015.

As it is clear from the chart, the rate of unemployment remained stable in the North Africa and in the South Asia during the whole period: 12,5% and 3,9% respectively. The average worldwide percentage kept its level at close to 6. The share of unemployment slightly dropped in the Middle East (approximately 1%) and in the Latin America (exactly 1 percent).

The highest point of the North Africa demonstrates a region with a lowest amount of citizens with a job. Among all selected regions, only European countries had a slight increase.
