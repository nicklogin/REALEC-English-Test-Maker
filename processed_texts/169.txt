For 3 given social nets (Facebook, Instagram and Linkedin) the graph shows their popularity among 4 different age groups. The graph indicates that Facebook is the most commonly used social net among all groups with 87% of adults aged 18-29 using it being the highest ratio and then steadily decreasing with the increase of age up to 56% for those aged 65+.

Graph for LinkedIn shows a different slope, though: a third of those between 30 and 65 use LinkedIn, which is more than the 22% result equal for both young adults and those above 65.

Distortion for LinkedIn is quite small - around 10% points and for Facebook is steady - for each 10-year increase, the drop of the % usage of the social net is around 10% with the overall drop from maximum to minimum being 30% point.
