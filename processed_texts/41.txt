Nowadays one of <<greatest**T1**Superlative_adj**None**14**the most great>> problems for those, who produce <<entertaining content**T3**lex_item_choice**None**19**entertainment items>> like music and films is <<prosperity**T5**Articles**None**14**the prospecity>> of pirate copies of their products. So, there are 2 <<points of view**T6**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**views>> on the existence of such phenomena.
<<On the one hand**T7**Prepositions**None**17**From the one hand>>, everyone should respect such talented people as musicians and producers who provide us with really useful things for our <<relaxation**T8**Category_confusion**None**8**relaxing>> or scientific satisfying. Thus, they must have <<right**T9**Articles**None**7**a right>> to be paid for their work <<, and**T10**Punctuation**None**3**and>> users of the Internet who download pirate files should be punished for illegal <<actions**T11**lex_item_choice**None**9**enjoyment>>. Furthermore, <<copying and sharing music or films**T12**Articles**None**38**the copying and sharing music or films>> in <<a non-original form**T13**Articles**None**20**of non-original form>> lead to <<deterioration**T14**Category_confusion**None**13**deteriorating>> of the products’ quality. The reason <<for**T15**Prepositions**None**2**of>> it <<can be in the accessibility of**T17**Absence_explanation**None**6**can be>> films recorded on videocameras from cinemaparks or music, recorded on <<concerts**T16**Articles**None**12**the concerts>>. In such way it seems that people of art #DELETE#9#producing <<just**T20**lex_item_choice**None**6**really>> waste their money <<creating**T21**Category_confusion**None**9**to create>> a good proffesional picture or sound.
On the other hand, in the era of developing technologies it is really convenient to use social networks or specialized applies as a platform to store music compositions or films. Thus, many people are ready to commit a law and have <<free cultural wealth**T34**Absence_explanation**None**13**a free wealth>>. However, this problem <<was solved**T23**Tense_choice**None**9**is solved>> by Apple corporation <<that**T24**Often_confused**None**5**which>> has a huge music resource <<that can be used for free**T25**Absence_explanation**None**4**free>> for three months. Moreover, there is a problem of people’s equality. It is considered that everyone should have <<right**T26**Articles**None**7**a right>> to use <<cultural wealth**T34**Articles**None**8**a wealth>> which is made and prepared <<for public to enjoy it**T31**Absence_explanation**None**9**to public>>. So, it should be available not only for those people who have a financial opportunity to pay for <<listening to music**T32**Prepositions**None**19**listening for music>> or watching films.
To sum up, it is really important for musicians and film producers to share their “masterpieces” with all people in <<an equal form**T34**Articles**None**10**equal form>>.
