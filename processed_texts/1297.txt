The piecharts <<compare**T1**Agreement_errors**None**8**compares>> the percentage of goods transported by rail and road in East-European countries in 2008. Railways are mostly used for <<metals**T2**Possessive**None**6**metals>> transportation and roads for food products. 

The first diagram gives information about products<< which were delivered by rail**T4**Defining**None**30**, which were delivered by rail>>. It is noticeable that the <<main**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**mean>> feature of the first graph is <<the percentage**T6**Articles**None**10**percentage>> of transported metals (35%). In contrast, road transportation has only 11% of metals delivery, but it provides 28% of manufactured goods transportation. It is close to 25% of <<manufactured goods**T12**Standard**None**30**goods produced at manufactured>>, but transported by rail. 

In conclusion, the main feature of two pie charts <<is**T8**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> that the most popular method of <<metals' transportation**T9**Standard**None**21**transportation metals>> is railways, whereas food products are delivered by autobahns. For manufactured goods two types of transportation are appropriate.
