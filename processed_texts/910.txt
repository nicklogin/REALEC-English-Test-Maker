These two diagrams illustrate amount of transportation of goods between countries in Eastern Europe by categories.
The First one gives information about approximation of goods, whiche were transported by rail. Because of high weight of metals, It takes more percents in goods transfer's by rail (It is about 35%) than by road (11%). Of course, manufactured goods also have a significant part in amount of goods transporations (about quarter of all traffic) by the same reason â€” huge weight. But, with comparison with second diagram, which shows that manufactured good's part is 28%, 25% is a standart quota
The second one represents, how goods are transported by raod: The largest part of amount belongs to food products with 30 percents. The main reason of this fact is that car is quicker, faster, non-flexible way to transport food to final destination than troin. Aniway, both diagrams just represent numbers, instead of reasons of these numbers.
