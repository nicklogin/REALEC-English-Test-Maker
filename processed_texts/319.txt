Music and film industries <<lose**T23**Often_confused**None**5**loose>> lots of money <<annually**T3**Spelling**None**7**annualy>> because of <<illegal**T4**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> copying of goods they are producing. These copies are shared <<on**T5**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet by ordinary people who does not want to buy original discs. <<Should they be punished for such actions?**T6**Interrogative**None**41**Should be they punished for such actions?>>
This issue is quite important in the modern society, where copyright does matter. Some people think that sharing music and films <<on**T7**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet without buying it is <<a theft**T8**Articles**None**5**theft>> and individuals<< that do it**T9**Defining**None**13**, that do it,>> should be punished with taxes and even be <<imprisoned**T10**Prefix**None**10**inprisoned>>. Music and films are not for free: musicians and film producers have made them for money <<, and**T11**Punctuation**None**3**and>> they put huge amounts of time and <<strength**T12**Spelling**None**7**strengh>> into implementation <<of their ideas**T13**Prepositions**None**11**their ideas>>. So, other people must respect a great work of artists, <<musicians**T14**Spelling**None**9**musitians>> and the whole industries and spend money on goods, <<such as**T15**Prepositions**None**4**such>> films and music, instead of stealing and sharing it for free.
However, other people discuss this perspective and say that if we have such a great opportunity <<to listen to music and to watch films**T16**Lack_par_constr**None**37**to listen to music and watching films>> via the Internet absolutely for free, so why we have to pay for it. They consider that these <<pieces**T17**Spelling**None**6**peases>> of art belong not only for producers and artists but for people in common. For example, when great musicians wrote their music, they got money from it but also <<ATgpw64a**T23**Tense_form**None**6**spread>> it among ordinary people. So, many people could get to know the musician. Furthermore, spreading music or films for free around the world could bring a huge population to the artist.
To sum up, the personal work should be copyrighted. Personally, I agree that people who <<share**T20**Tense_choice**None**6**shared>> music and films should be punished somehow, but not very strict, as not many users of the Internet are aware of copyright existence <<, and**T21**Punctuation**None**3**and>> they are used to <<get**T22**lex_item_choice**None**4**gain>> all the things, like films and music, <<on**T23**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet without paying any sums of money.
