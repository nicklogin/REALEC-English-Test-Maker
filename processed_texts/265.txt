Some people think that people who are engaged in illegal copying, sharing and downloading music or films should be punished. Others believe that there is nothing awful in making it free.
<<In**T1**Prepositions**None**2**To>> my personal <<point**T2**Noun_number**None**6**points>> of view, people should pay for the music or films that professionals <<make**T3**Often_confused**None**2**do>>. Firstly, pirate copies are not allowed to use. Moreover, it can lead to serious problems with the government, you can even be sentences to <<certain years of imprisonment**T4**Absence_explanation**None**13**certain years>>. Secondly, we basically live in a modern world where labour should be paid <<with money**T5**Prepositions**None**5**money>>. Also, people work as hard as it is possible, they do not sleep, do not see their families in order to make a good quality product for the society which should respect not only itself, but others as well!
However, there <<exists**T6**Agreement_errors**None**5**exist>> another opinion that I do not have to pay for these things that are called art. Firstly, <<if I cannot pay for the music I like because of a lack of money,**T8**Punctuation**None**63**if I cannot pay for the music I like because of a lack of money>> why is it impossible to listen to the versions that were copied? <<Secondly, why should people pay for the music that are free on the Internet nowadays?**T9**Interrogative**None**85**Secondly, why people should pay for the music that are free on the Internet nowadays?>> <<The same thing is about music**T10**Abs_comp_clause**None**27**The same thing about movies>>.
Anyway, <<if you do not have money,**T11**Punctuation**None**24**if you do not have money>> go and earn some. <<If a person is really fond of listening to music or watching TV,**T13**Punctuation**None**63**If a person is really fond of listening to music or watching TV>> he will find a solution to buy something she or he likes because we live in the 21 century where human rights are respected. Furthermore, <<a price**T14**Articles**None**5**price>> on music and films is not so extremely high. Everyone can easily afford it.
To sum everything up, I am strongly <<agree**T15**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**9**convinced>> with the fact that human beings must respect modern rules and live according to the law. Actually, such things as music or films motivate you, make you dream and broaden horizons for sure. Why should not we pay for it?
