One of the most disturbing and dangerous social trends today is <<the rise**T1**Articles**None**4**rise>> in the amount of crimes commited by young people. It is important to understand how to fight it, and that is why we need to point out the possible reasons <<for**T2**lex_part_choice**None**2**of>> the trend.
First of all, the modern world is largely urbanized. And with urbanization, the era of traditional families passes, <<giving way**T3**Redundant**None**12**giving a way>> to nuclear modern-type families.
Many of the latter have a single child, and contact with their relatives rarely. As a result, children from these families might not have a close person – that is, a sister, a brother or a grandparent, - to interact with and <<to be developed by**T4**Verb_Inf**None**7**develop>> socially. This may <<give birth**T5**lex_part_choice**None**11**give a life>> to mental problems, making a person socially dangerous.
Another reason behind these crimes may be the <<risen**T6**Tense_form**None**5**rosen>> popularity of the Internet. Without any doubt, there are plenty of benefits provided by the Internet, such as an ability to communicate with people across a sea, learn almost any information and read any book. Yet#DELETE#1#, the sense of being connected to the whole world makes a person vulnerable to the words of people trying to verbally offend <<him**T7**Agreement_errors**None**4**them>>#DELETE#1#, and that may be a motivation for <<committing**T8**Spelling**None**9**commiting>> a #DELETE#4#hate crime, especially if you are young and expressive.
How can the society try to solve this problem? To soften the negative effects that I have written about above, <<the following things**T21**Absence_comp_sent**None**13**the following>> could be done.
<<Firstly,**T17**Punctuation**None**5**First>> teachers at school <<should observe**T14**Modals**None**19**should be observing>> closely each child’s psychological state to give <<him**T15**Agreement_errors**None**4**them>> any needed support. Secondly, #DELETE#3#the parents need to pay close attention to what their children watch and read#DELETE#1#, <<on**T17**suggestion**None**2**in>> the Internet and beyond#DELETE#1#, to save them from negative impacts.
Fighting against crimes, it is important to remember to care about people who can potentially commit <<them**T17**Agreement_errors**None**2**it>>.
