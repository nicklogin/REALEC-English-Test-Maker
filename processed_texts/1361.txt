The pie charts illustrate the #DELETE#9#transport <<exchange of goods**T19**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**exchange>> within Eastern Europe by rail and road in 2008.

Overall, there are some common trends and differences <<in the given charts**T1**Articles**None**19**in the given charts>>. As it <<can**T20**Modals**None**5**could>> be <<noticed**T3**Spelling**None**7**notices>> from the first glance, the most <<steady**T4**Spelling**None**5**stead>> trend is <<the transportation**T5**Articles**None**14**transportation>> of manufactured <<goods**T6**Spelling**None**4**good>> <<, which**T7**Punctuation**None**5**which>> has almost similar figures in both pie charts.
#DELETE#11#After that, <<The**T25**Capitalisation**Dependent_change**3**the>> following <<steady**T8**Spelling**None**5**stead>> trend is <<the transportation of Chemicals**T9**Absence_explanation**None**11**‘Chemicals’>> with 11 per cent by rail and 16% by road. <<Also,**T10**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> non-metallic minerals <<were transported**T11**Voice**None**13**transportated>> <<almost**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**nearly>> similar (13% by road and 11% by rail).

By contrast, there are also some dramatic downward trends in the charts. For instance, <<a sharp difference**T13**Articles**None**16**sharp difference>> of machinery’s <<transportation**T14**Spelling**None**14**transportating>>: 12% by rail fell to only 2% by road. Additionally, <<the amount of**T15**Articles**None**9**amount of>> <<transported**T16**Spelling**None**14**transportating>> metals by road is only a <<one-third**T21**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**third>> part of <<the transportation**T17**lex_item_choice**None**3**one>> by rail (11%$ and 35% respectively). The same pattern is <<ovserved**T22**lex_item_choice**None**9**concerned>> for food products, however, <<the direction of the pattern**T23**Absence_explanation**None**2**it>> is reversed (11% by rail and 30% by road).
