In the modern world, it is claimed that technologies might have a negative impact on people's health. However, it cannot be denied that electronic <<devices**T11**Derivation**None**8**machines>> may cause health issues. I completely agree with this statement and I would like to express my opinion on this situation.
Firstly, <<young people in particular**T13**Word_choice**None**23**especially young people>> tend to pass a lot of their time in front of computers playing online games, communicating with friends or simply watching videos and listening to music. These ways of spending time can lead to headaches and decrease teenagers' quality of vision. Secondly, there are a lot of <<Wi-Fi**T2**Capitalisation**None**5**Wi-fi>> networks all over the world that produce <<electromagnetic**T1**Compound_word**None**10**electronic>> waves. Obviously, this can badly influence our brain and body. Furthermore, people can be stressed if they do not know how to  fix the broken computer that they are working on, which <<has an impact on**T3**Category_confusion**None**7**impacts>> our <<nervous**T4**Category_confusion**None**6**nerves>> system and does not let #DELETE#7#humans' <<the body**T24**Articles**None**6**bodies>> regulate natural processes.
Nevertheless, the world is <<capable of reducing**T17**Gerund_phrase**None**17**capable to reduce>> this <<effect**T5**Often_confused**None**6**affect>>. For example, people can limit the time <<of their work**T18**Category_confusion**None**7**working>> with technology to a few hours per day. Also, all the families can switch off the <<Wi-Fi**T6**Capitalisation**None**5**Wi-fi>> network during <<nighttime**T10**Compound_word**None**10**night time>>. Sometimes if it is possible, humans should have vacations <<out in the wild**T19**Word_choice**None**7**outside>> and enjoy <<nature**T20**Articles**None**10**the nature>> without using any modern technologies. These ways will help to reduce most of the problems caused by electronic <<appliances**T7**lex_item_choice**None**8**machines>>.
To conclude, it is worth mentioning that modern technology is <<a very useful and interesting invention**T21**Articles**None**37**very useful and interesting invention>> of the last centures. <<Nevertheless**T8**Linking_device**None**11**In any case>>, it can be <<harmful to**T12**Prepositions**None**11**harmful for>> <<one's health**T22**Determiners**None**10**the health>>; therefore, people should not forget to <<use**T23**Word_choice**None**4**take>> <<its benefits**T24**Determiners**None**18**the benefits of it>> wisely.
