Nowadays the data shows that the crime rate is constantly decreasing in most of the countries. However, it is usually not mentioned that, at the same time, this rate is rising for some of the groups #DELETE#2#as, for instance, teenagers and young people. In this essay I will elaborate on major causes of this problem and on some possible solutions to it.

The first factor that could lead to the increase of crimes commited by the young is a rather significant number of children who become orphans. It is a well-known fact that the example of family is vital for the right upbringing.

The second reason for the rise of the juvenile crime is the exposure of the young to the violence which they observe on a daily basis while watching TV or playing computer games. Nowadays with the technological advancement entertainment industry is deve<<developing**T6**Spelling**None**11**developping>>matically and one of its most promising spheres is computer and 3d technology. Unfortunately, they tend to be more and more focused on violent games and films which involve burgling, kidnapping and even killing people. Children who are very sens<<sensitive**T1**Often_confused**None**8**sensible>>the examples they see around them can adopt this behaviour and cons<<consider it to be**T15**Verb_Inf**None**14**consider it as>>ormal one. The solution to this problem can be the restriction of acce<<access**T3**Spelling**None**5**acces>>Tv a<<tv**T4**Spelling**None**2**Tv>> computers and the control of the content on them by parents. Besides, there are some special programs that can be ints<<installed**T5**Spelling**None**9**intsalled>>order to help parents to control their children's usage of computers and TV.

To conclude, although the problem of the increasing juvenile crime is extremely crucial, there are some steps and tactics that can be effective as, for instance, the support of orphans by their teachers or the control of the acces <<access**T2**Spelling**None**5**acces>>levision and computers.
