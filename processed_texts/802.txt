Nowadays the world has become more dangerous. Moreover, the illegal actions may be done by youngsters. What make them behaive this way? I this essay, I will highlight some causes and suggest possible ways how to solve them.

Firstly, it can be highlited that not every child has the same opportunities as his/her peers. If one classmate has the new phone, his friends will also interested in it. But not everyone has enough money to buy. That is the reason of stealing the phone from the shop or from another man. The possible solution of this problem may be the creating of equality in schools, which does not make young people want to commit a crime.

The second possible cause is prohibition of doing something. Some juveniles have very strict parents who prohibite eating sweets, coming home late and stealing. Growing up these children realise that the vast majority of these prohibitons is not true and that may force them take something illegaly. If parents and teachers do not want to have negative effect of uprising the children, they should explain the nessecity of this doings and the difference in causes of overeatig and robbering.

One more possible reason why nowadays juveniles are committing the crimes is that this is a significant opportunity to get parents' attention. Children in many families are being grown up by grandparents or nurses, nevertheless they cannot spend enough time with parents. Some of them are interested in stealing because this action can link them with parents. And that is why they should spend more time with children.

To conclude, today there are a great number of children who are stealing different things. The causes of this phenomenon may be different. However in all the cases adults should spend more time with the younger generation and explain why some actions are not acceptable in our society.
