It is a big problem for <<the modern world**T19**Articles**None**12**modern world>> when young people tend to commit crimes. Reoson for it is development of media, and <<the Internet**T9**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. <<So,**T64**Punctuation**None**2**So>> <<therefore**T63**Spelling**None**10**the refore>>, <<parents**T61**Spelling**None**7**perents>> and teachers should <<provide**T60**Spelling**None**6**provid>> children of information <<opposite**T22**Spelling**None**7**opposit>> to <<what**T23**Pronouns**None**5**which>> they can see on TV or <<Internet**T9**Capitalisation**None**12**the Internet>>.
Media and <<the Internet**T9**Articles**None**8**Internet>> provides <<children**T56**Derivation**None**9**childrens>> with tons of information and most of it <<is not**T57**Tense_form**None**5**is no>> good. You can find a lot of <<stories**T50**Often_confused**None**9**histories>> <<, and**T51**Punctuation**None**3**and>> movies can be found<< which tell us about successful crimes**T53**Defining**None**41**, which tell us about a successful crimes>>. When young people see all of it, they usually think <<that**T47**Spelling**None**4**taht>> they can do the same.
Media and <<the Internet**T9**Articles**None**8**Internet>> gave birth to computer games. Several computer games have killing people as main action in the game. <<Therefore**T9**Capitalisation**None**10**there fore>>, when you play such a game for <<a long**T37**Spelling**None**5**along>> time you <<become**T38**Spelling**None**6**became>> less <<sensitive**T39**Spelling**None**9**sensetive>> to it in <<the real life**T40**Articles**None**9**real life>>.
therefore, <<parents**T28**Spelling**None**7**perents>> and <<teachers**T1**Spelling**None**9**theachers>> should control children's accsess to information. Young people should read more <<about**T11**Spelling**None**5**obout>> stories <<in which you save and help other people**T27**Defining**None**36**where you save and help other people>>. <<Young**T17**Spelling**None**4**Yong>> people should hear stories <<about**T14**Spelling**None**5**obout>> great people who were real <<, not artificial**T16**Punctuation**None**14**not artificial>> <<superheroes**T15**Spelling**None**12**super Herous>>. 
However, <<parents**T29**Spelling**None**7**perents>> can't properly control <<what**T30**Spelling**None**4**whot>> their children <<do**T31**Tense_choice**None**5**doing>> in the <<the Internet**T9**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. <<Therefore**T9**Spelling**None**10**there fore>> to compensate a ton of bad information they should provide opposite information <<about**T43**Spelling**None**5**obout>> good people. In schools there #DELETE#3#are should be special attention to history lessons.
In order to tackle the problem we should <<erase**T45**Spelling**None**5**arase>> the reason. However, we <<can't**T2**Spelling**None**4**cont>> <<totally**T3**Spelling**None**6**totaly>> cut <<children's**T44**Possessive**None**8**children>> <<connection**T4**Spelling**None**8**conction>> to the <<Internet**T18**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. <<Therefore**T10**Spelling**None**10**There fore>>, we should provide <<children**T5**Derivation**None**9**childrens>>#DELETE#1#, with information about people<< who were honest, kind, and hard-working**T7**Defining**None**40**, who were honest, kind and hard-working>>, <<gaining**T8**Spelling**None**7**goining>> enormous <<success**T9**Spelling**None**7**sucsess>>.
