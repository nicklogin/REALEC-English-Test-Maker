I <<am of**T8**lex_item_choice**None**5**adopt>> an opinion that the main problem of <<people**T9**Articles**None**10**the people>> is <<people**T10**Ref_device**None**4**they>> themselves. <<Interestingly,**T13**Punctuation**None**13**Interestingly>> there is <<no**T11**lex_item_choice**None**7**not any>> kind of animal that would have <<problems**T12**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> with its natural environment. Nowadays, the mankind is in a rather hard situation. I think <<most problems**T14**Articles**None**17**the most problems>> <<come**T15**Agreement_errors**None**5**comes>> from <<insufficient consciousness**T1**Absence_comp_colloc**None**14**unconsciosness>> of most people, either governments <<or**T16**Conjunctions**None**3**and>> citizens. A number of governments want to start the wars between them. It creates a lot of problems <<for**T343**Prepositions**None**2**to>> <<people**T17**Articles**None**10**the people>>. <<Apart from it,**T345**Punctuation**None**13**Apart from it>> a lot of people <<in**T7**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the world want to get <<money**T18**Articles**None**9**the money>> more than anything in this life. It is also <<a source**T347**Articles**None**10**the source>> of many troubles, because their main <<motivation**T2**Noun_number**None**11**motivations>> is not <<happiness**T19**Articles**None**13**the happiness>> of <<other people**T20**lex_part_choice**None**14**another people>>.
I do not understand,<< how**T21**Punctuation**None**5**, how>>we can think about t<<space exploration**T22**Articles**None**21**the space exploration>>l<<looking at**T23**Prepositional_verb**None**10**looking on>>the range of all these troubles w<<which**T24**Spelling**None**4**wich>>come from ourselves. I do not know a<<much**T25**lex_item_choice**None**8**a lot of>>in the s<<space science**T3**Confusion_of_structures**None**20**science of the space>> but it seems very hard for me to believe that t<<space exploration**T4**Articles**None**21**the space exploration>>can solve these problems. I think we should attempt to stop doing all these stupid things and e<<explain everything**T26**Absence_comp_colloc**None**7**explain>>to all p<<the people**T348**Articles**None**6**people>>of the world and to the next generation. If all the people w<<just understand**T351**Conditionals**None**21**would just understand>>these issues and start to do only right things, a lot of problems will disappear in a moment. After it the next generation can explore t<<space**T27**Articles**None**9**the space>>and go to another planet with much more w<<wonderful**T28**Spelling**None**10**wonderfull>>plans for life. But if we w<<do not solve**T5**Tense_choice**None**14**will not solve>>our problems and w<<go**T29**Tense_choice**None**7**will go>>to another planet, the problems will not g<<go away**T30**lex_part_choice**None**5**go on>> they will remain with us. So this is not a real solution for us. And all people should understand that only people can solve t<<their own**T31**Ref_device**None**12**the people's>>problems.
