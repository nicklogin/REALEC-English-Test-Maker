Today, information about everything can be found <<on**T1**Prepositions**None**4**with>> the Internet. Moreover, <<computers**T2**Spelling**None**8**computes>> and <<cellphones**T3**Noun_number**None**9**cellphone>> give people <<opportunities**T4**Spelling**None**12**oppotunities>> for watching movies and <<listening to**T46**Prepositional_verb**None**8**lisening>> music <<at**T7**Prepositions**None**2**in>> their own home. But on the other hand, the expand of this <<opportunities**T8**Spelling**None**12**oppotunities>> brings negative influences for producers of films and musicians, because today rising of coping and sharing <<these**T9**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> products decreases producersâ€™ income.
Firstly, the main reason<< why behavior of copying, sharing and downloading illegal files has to be punished**T10**Punctuation**None**84**, why behavior of copying, sharing and downloading illegal files has to be punished,>> is that <<hard work**T12**Spelling**None**9**hard-work>> of producers and musicians <<does**T358**Agreement_errors**None**2**do>> not bring them enough money.
For example, people who do <<other**T24**Category_confusion**None**6**others>> jobs have <<a regular salary**T14**Articles**None**14**regular salary>> for <<a part**T25**Articles**None**4**part>> of work<< that they do**T26**Defining**None**14**, that they do>> <<, and**T28**Punctuation**None**3**and>> if their boss does not give enough money #DELETE#6#salary <<to**T29**Prepositions**None**3**for>> them, they will change their jobs.
On the other hand, the <<great**T17**lex_item_choice**None**4**high>> <<opportunities**T16**Punctuation**None**12**oppotinities>> <<to**T18**Prepositions**None**3**for>> download these files <<allow**T19**Agreement_errors**None**6**allows>> poor people <<to watch**T20**Infinitive_constr**None**5**watch>> <<these**T21**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> movies and <<listen to**T46**Prepositional_verb**None**5**lisen>> this music too.
Secondly, people who <<buy**T31**Confusion_of_structures**None**6**buying>> the original version pay their own money for it <<, and**T32**Punctuation**None**3**and>> other people have to do the same thing. If people do not buy the original movie #DELETE#7#of film, they break <<the rules**T46**Articles**None**5**roles>> of morality, because if one person pay money for <<a thing**T35**Articles**None**5**thing>>, the other person <<has**T363**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> to pay for this too or she or he will be a <<thief**T365**Spelling**None**4**thif>>.
<<From**T36**Prepositions**None**2**In>> <<another**T37**Often_confused**None**5**other>> point of view, almost all people in the world do not have <<enough**T38**Spelling**None**7**enought>> money for food and water <<, and**T39**Punctuation**None**3**and>> they find ways <<of**T369**Prepositions**None**3**for>> watching movies and <<listening to**T46**Prepositional_verb**None**8**lisening>> music in <<downloading**T367**Confusion_of_structures**None**9**downloads>> illegal copies from the Internet.
To conclude, if people have money for buying original copies, they have to do it. <<However,**T371**Ref_device**None**17**On the other hand>>, <<the poor part**T43**Articles**None**9**poor part>> of world population can watch <<these**T373**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> films and <<listen to**T46**Prepositional_verb**None**5**lisen>> music in <<an illegal way**T46**Articles**None**11**illegal way>>.
