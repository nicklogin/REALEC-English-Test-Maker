The pie charts illustrate the delivering process of products and materials between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008. There are 2 <<kinds**T1**Noun_number**None**4**kind>> of transportation: by rail and by road.

Overall, food products made up a tangible 30% in transportation by road whereas in transportation by rail metals represented the highest percentage of 35%. <<Also,**T2**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> manufactured goods remained almost similar in both ways of delivering (25% for rail transportation and 28% for <<the road one**T3**Articles**None**8**road one>>).

As can be seen from the pie charts, machinery goods are more likely to be transferred by rail than by road. The same pattern can be observed in <<the transportation**T4**Articles**None**14**transportation>> of metals. Metals <<transported**T6**Category_confusion**None**14**transportation>> by road <<constitute**T5**Agreement_errors**None**11**constitutes>> #DELETE#3#for 11% <<and it is**T8**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**and>> almost 3 times more (35%) <<than**T9**Prepositions**None**3**for>> by rail transportation. What is more, <<chemicals and feed products's percentages**T13**Possessive**None**39**chemicals and feed products percentages>> in <<the road delivering chart**T11**Articles**None**18**by road delivering>> are the same (11%). As for non-metallic minerals, the quantity of these goods in #DELETE#2#by <<the road transportation chart**T20**Absence_explanation**None**19**road transportation>> is significantly bigger than in #DELETE#2#by <<the rail one**T18**Articles**None**8**rail one>>. Furthermore, manufactured goods and food products make the major part of <<the transportation**T19**Articles**None**14**transportation>> by road whereas in <<the transportation**T20**Articles**None**14**transportation>> by rail it is metals and manufactured goods together (35% and 25% respectively).
