People who make music or films do not earn that amount of money which they could because other people download illegal pirates copies of these types of art from <<the Internet**T1**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. Some people are sure that it is <<a theft**T2**Articles**None**5**theft>>.
Firstly, if people download something from the Internet, there is <<a**T14**Articles**Dependent_change**2**an>> <<possibility**T3**Often_confused**Dependent_change**11**opportunity>> that the quality of it will be awful, as <<a consequence**T4**Noun_number**None**14**a consequences>>, they can not watch <<a film**T5**Articles**None**8**the film>> or listen to music. Secondly, copying and sharing music or films is <<a theft**T6**Articles**None**5**theft>>, so, people who <<do**T7**Tense_choice**None**3**did>> it will be able <<to get**T8**Infinitive_constr**None**11**to have got>> some problems with policemen. And, as a result, <<a prison**T9**Noun_number**None**7**prisons>> waits <<for them**T10**Prepositions**None**4**them>>.
However, another group of people does not agree with the first. They suppose that it is not <<a theft**T11**Articles**None**5**theft>>, it is only a chance to make watching and listening more convenience. They do not go to supermarkets or music shops to buy <<video- or CD-disks there**T16**Standard**None**23**there video or CD-disks>>. In addition to this, if they want to watch <<an old film**T12**Articles**None**8**old film>>, there is <<a**T17**Articles**Dependent_change**2**an>> <<possibility**T13**Often_confused**Dependent_change**11**opportunity>> that they can not find it in shops.
As for me, I would disagree with this statement. First of all, now we live in the century of technology, so, why do we need to buy these products? And, obviously, this “theft” helps musicians and film producers. I can explain how. Music and films on the <<Internet**T18**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> are free, so, more people can listen and watch these, so, they <<recommend**T19**lex_item_choice**None**6**advise>> it <<to**T20**Prepositions**None**3**for>> friends and family, and, as a result, someone can buy <<dvd**T21**lex_item_choice**None**4**film>> – or CD – disks <<, and**T22**Punctuation**None**3**and>> this piece of music or <<a film**T23**Articles**None**4**film>> <<becomes**T24**Agreement_errors**None**6**become>> more popular.
To sum up, <<there are**T25**Abs_comp_clause**None**5**there>> two groups of people. The first group decides that copying and sharing music or films is <<a theft**T26**Articles**None**5**theft>>, and people have to stop doing it. And the second group thinks that it helps musicians and producers with their unpopular products.
