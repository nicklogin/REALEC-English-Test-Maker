In truth, young people commit a lot of crimes nowadays and I see two main reasons for that. Crime is not only a much easier way for young people if we speak about non-violent crime, but also an act of <<committing**T1**Spelling**None**9**commiting>> <<a crime**T3**Articles**None**9**the crime>> becomes <<unacceptable**T4**Category_confusion**None**10**unaccepted>> for people.
What is one of the main reasons to commit a crime? Money. People like fast and easy ways to make money, <<and so do young people**T5**Tense_form**None**16**and young people>> <<, especially**T6**Punctuation**None**10**especially>>. Why work hard on <<a manufacture**T7**Articles**None**15**the manufacture>> if you can just go and sell some drugs or rob someone? And working <<fairly**T8**Category_confusion**None**4**fair>> becomes harder and harder for young, especially just graduated, people as they can't find a job that suits them due to <<lack**T9**Articles**None**8**the lack>> of experience. <<Compared**T10**Voice**None**9**Comparing>> to that, crime becomes easier.
And it isn't just easier. <<Now**T11**Capitalisation**None**3**now>>, it is more romantic as well! Young people, especially children and <<adolescents**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**9**teenagers>>, watch a lot of films where criminals are <<so-called**T13**lex_item_choice**None**9**such said>> "<<tough guys**T14**Absence_comp_colloc**None**9**cool guys>>": rich, loved by women and <<sometimes**T15**Category_confusion**None**8**sometime>> even acting better#DELETE#1#, than police itself. <<Thus,**T18**Punctuation**None**4**Thus>> <<crime**T17**Articles**None**9**the crime>> doesn't seem #DELETE#2#as bad anymore, or it might seem bad, but very cool, and young people want to look cool.
What can we do with it? Honestly, not much. It is more of an educative matter, parents and teachers should really teach the children that regardless of how cool it looks or how easy it may be, a crime is always a crime. People <<shouldn't mistake**T20**Modals**None**18**shouldn't mistaken>> crime for a normal thing because "everyone does it". If we just keep telling teenagers that crime is what you can get caught for - they <<won't**T21**Coherence**None**8**wouldn't>> stop.
Written above is <<quite**T22**Inappropriate_register**None**6**pretty>> <<much of my position**T28**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**much my position>> on this problem. We can't fight <<crime**T23**Articles**None**9**the crime>> among <<young people**T24**Articles**None**16**the young people>> directly. People won't stop doing it until they get used from <<childhood**T25**Articles**None**13**the childhood>> that crime is bad <<and can't be excused.**T27**Punctuation**None**26**for no excuses and that is>>
