Nowadays there exists quite widespread problem of illegal copying and selling of different media production. The sector of under-the-low sector in these sphere may be a great obstacle in media distributing and development. Although author rights appreciation should become common, I could not agree with the concept of olligatory punishment for both traders and users.

To my mind, campagain against illegal distributing should be based on the correct price regulation. Also it must be combined with sites and programmed moderation. It is more rational just to prevent hardships with illegal lusiness than put in motion governmental punishment. For example, programme ITunes maked by apple provides legal access so the music and film archives just on the payment lease. Government just observe for example, Internet nel-sily and ban these who enlarge she ability of illegal free acess.

On the other hand, in several country there is no special lows for this issue regulation. Many companies, musicians and film producers located in the countries nish specific terms of distribution of media products, brake conflicts just license of collaboration with country without strong regulations that emerges, illegal hady and acting. In this case it is also easier to prevent international misunderstanding just by making compositions or film of specific comoser or filmmaker inaccesible as, for experience, social net VKontakte made. So politicy of pretension may be more effective in countries without special regulations.

To sum up, shuggling against illegal against illegal business is an important part of every trade regulation. But it should not be presented on criminal level with the government inhifuence. The solution of prolem lay in the sphere of strict moderacy and private sites’ or companies’ regulation.
