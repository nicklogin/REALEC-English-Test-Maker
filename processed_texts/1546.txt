Nowadays the problem concerning the usage of drugs in sport is really burgent. All people is sure that it must be punished, however, they have different opinion about the punishment itself. While some people is sure that professional sportsmen who use illegal drugs have to be banned from the competitions for a several years (about 2), others believe that it is necessary to banned them forever. In my essay the arguments of both sides will be discussed carefully and I will give my own point of view.
To begin with, it should be noted that athletes spend all their time for sport and it usually means that they cannot work in another sphere. Hence, if we cancel them to take part in competitions for the rest of their lives, we may make their lives useless. In addition, all people tend to make some mistakes during their lives, consequently, it is not right not to give them a chance to improve the situation. Therefore, Although it might be true to say that being a professional spontsman is too responsiable (especially if we talk about international competitions), it does not necessary mean that athletes have to be punished for so long time.
Nevertheless, any balanced essay ought to take into account another point of view. Many people can argue that all athletes knew about possiable result before they use illegal drugs, hence, they must be fully responsiable for their choise. Provided that the illegal usage of drugs is proved carefully, sportsmen have to be banned from competitions as well as lose their professional status. In addition, less strict rules is able to cause problems again after the two-year period.
To conclude, the issue connected with illegal usage of drugs by athletes provokes heated debates and both sides have strong arguments. Much as I agree with people, who wanted athletes to be banned forever, I also understand that it cannot overcome the problem at all, and it might be too serious penalty because all people have a right to make mistakes.
