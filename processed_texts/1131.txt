The problem of pirate copies is very acute nowadays. There are many people wo earn <<money**T1**lex_item_choice**None**12**a livelihood>> by selling pirate copies and they still <<have not**T2**Inappropriate_register**None**7**haven’t>> been punished. But <<, at the same time,**T3**Punctuation**None**17**at the same time,>> there are many people of art industry who become <<the victims**T4**Articles**None**7**victims>> of ‘media’ pirates. I will describe my opinion in the paragraphs below. 

First of all, I absolutely agree that it is sort of a crime to copy and share music or films or any kind of media on the <<Internet**T5**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> without <<the permission**T6**Articles**None**10**permission>> of the owner. There should be a special rule for that issue. To my mind, <<governments**T7**Noun_number**None**10**government>> should stricky prohibit <<online**T8**lex_item_choice**None**8**internet>> thefts. 

Secondly, the reason why people <<download**T9**Spelling**None**9**downloade>> pirate copies is that <<, generally,**T10**Punctuation**None**9**generally>> usual <<Internet**T11**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> users <<do not**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> see any crime in it. So, <<governments**T13**Noun_number**None**10**government>> should pay a lot of attention to #DELETE#7#promote spreading of legal copies. We have seen some faint <<attempts**T15**Spelling**None**11**attemptions>> to promote legal copies via TV commercials but <<, to me,**T16**Punctuation**None**5**to me>> it is not enough. Usual <<Internet**T17**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> users should not be punished for downloading pirate copies because sometimes it is the only way to get a very expensive and rare computer <<program**T18**Noun_number**None**8**programs>> for free. However, <<conscientiously**T19**Category_confusion**None**13**conscientious>>, pirates  should be punished because they do a serious act of crime. 

Speaking about worldwide experience, Hollywood movie makers have been working so hard to stop pirate copies. They put a lot of effort to prohibit illegal copying. They have a lot of rules that have been supported by the government. But sometimes rules <<do not**T20**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> work in the way they are supposed to. For example, recently there has been a pirate copy of new Sherlock Holmes series on the <<Internet**T21**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. Even <<the director**T22**Articles**None**8**director>> <<did not**T23**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn’t>> know how that happened. It means that sometimes there should be drastic measures to avoid the spread of illegal copies. 

In conclusion, I think that it is fairly important to provide <<the safe spread**T24**Articles**None**11**safe spread>> of movies or music and support legal copies. We have to fight with thefts and respect #DELETE#8#piece of art.
