<<Nowadays**T2**Punctuation**None**8**Nowdays,>> some people think<< that**T3**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> health problems exist thanks using of modern technology.

I agree with this point of view because <<modern technologies**T4**Articles**None**23**the modern technologies>> damage our environment, <<for example,**T6**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> air, ocean, <<lakes**T7**Spelling**None**6**lackes>> and other. For instance, some <<people**T8**Spelling**None**7**peoples>> have <<diseases**T9**lex_item_choice**None**8**sickness>> like astma or <<epilepsy**T10**Spelling**None**8**epelepsy>>. Also, many factories <<are located**T11**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**located>> near the hometown, near the buildings<< where**T12**Punctuation**None**7**, where>> people <<live**T13**Agreement_errors**None**5**lives>> and <<work**T14**Agreement_errors**None**5**works>>. Moreover, <<garbage**T15**lex_item_choice**None**4**junk>>, which all people and many different  factories have, <<damages**T16**Agreement_errors**None**6**damage>> oceans, rivers, forests, and it is <<the reason**T46**Articles**None**5**cause>><< why**T19**Punctuation**None**5**, why>> many people have many <<kinds**T20**Noun_number**None**4**king>> of <<problems**T21**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> with their health, and, also, many organisms and animals <<die**T22**Agreement_errors**None**4**died>>. For example, some kind of fish died because <<the river**T23**Articles**None**5**river>> where they lived<< was**T24**Punctuation**None**5**, was>> <<damaged**T25**Spelling**None**6**damage>> by <<garbage**T26**lex_item_choice**None**4**junk>>. 

Moreover, <<because of that**T27**lex_item_choice**None**13**thank to junk>>, new <<parasites**T28**Spelling**None**8**parasits>> #DELETE#9#and paste <<can be born**T30**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**born>> in this junk, <<it**T31**Ref_device**None**4**what>> <<leads**T32**Agreement_errors**None**4**lead>> to huge problems, for example, it <<can lead**T33**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**lead>> to #DELETE#4#born some dangerous <<diseases**T35**lex_item_choice**None**8**sickness>>. 

I think<< that**T36**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> this problem <<has**T38**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> a few <<solutions**T39**lex_item_choice**None**4**ways>> #DELETE#10#for decide. The first <<way**T41**Noun_number**None**4**ways>> is <<to ptoduce**T42**Infinitive_constr**None**7**produse>> some things (for example, dangerous details for <<cars**T43**Noun_number**None**3**car>>) in space or some planet<< where**T44**Punctuation**None**7**, where>> <<people do not live**T45**Standard**None**18**do not live people>>. Also, junk should be <<reused**T46**Spelling**None**5**reuse>>, for example, like paper or plastic.
