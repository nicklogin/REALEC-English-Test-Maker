<<In the graph**T11**Prepositions**None**12**On the graph>>, we can see figures for the percentage of <<American adults**T3**Possessive**None**6**the US>> adults <<who use**T1**Defining**None**5**using>> the Internet#DELETE#1#, being registered in social networks.
From this graph, one can conclude that Facebook has more adult users overall than Instagram or LinkedIn. The percentage level of 65+ people using Facebook is especially high in <<comparison**T5**Spelling**None**11**comparisson>> to those of Instagram’s <<or**T4**lex_item_choice**None**3**and>> LinkedIn’s – it is 56% against 6% + 22%.
Another trend is that LinkedIn has the average adult user age balanced at the level of 49, while Instagram users are primarily 18 to 29 years old, and Facebook has more relatively young people registered with the figures of 87%, 73%, 63% and 56% for 18-29, 30-49, 50-64 and 65+ age groups respectively.
Overall, <<the most represented age group in all three networks is the 18-29 group**T9**Word_choice**None**100**the group that is most present in the three social networks as a composition is people aged 18 to 29>>. It is remarkable that the least <<represented**T10**lex_item_choice**None**7**present>> group in all three networks, <<which consists of people who are 65 years old or older**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**37**which is 65 years old people or older>>, <<is represented in LinkedIn equally with other groups**T6**Absence_explanation**None**30**is equally present in LinkedIn>>. This highlights that, in general, an average LinkedIn user is expected to be older than an average Facebook user, <<who**T7**lex_item_choice**None**5**which>> is in his turn expected to be older than <<a user**T8**Agreement_errors**None**5**those>> of Instagram.
