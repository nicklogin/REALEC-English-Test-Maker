Nowadays doping in sport is more widespread than ever. Some people believe that such sportsmen who were caught using illegal drugs should be banned from official competitions <<temporarily**T1**Spelling**None**10**temporarly>>. For example, two years. Others claim that these <<athletes**T6**Spelling**None**8**athelets>> <<must not**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**7**mustn't>> take part in any <<competition**T8**Noun_number**None**12**competitions>> <<ever**T11**Adverbs**None**7**forever>>. As for myself, I would support the first opinion.
Firstly, these <<athletes**T31**Spelling**None**8**athelets>> who were caught using doping are not only banned from competing <<professionally**T9**Spelling**None**14**proffesionally>> but also shamed by society a lot. So they are practically <<penalized**T10**Spelling**None**9**penylized>> twice. To my mind, <<it is**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it's>> enough to prevent further attempts. <<Secondly,**T13**Punctuation**None**9**Secondly.>> sometimes sportsmen <<do not**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don't>> even know that they are using forbidden <<supplies**T14**Spelling**None**8**sypplies>>. That was the pars of the doping scandal with <<Russian**T16**Capitalisation**None**7**russian>> <<athletes**T24**Spelling**None**8**athelets>> last summer, some of them <<did not**T17**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn't>> even know about it. So why should we ban them for the rest of their lives?
On the other hand, I can understand people who believe that <<if sportsmen have done it on purpose,**T18**Punctuation**None**36**if sportsmen have done it on purpose>> they should be banned for the rest of their lives. <<They have**T25**Inappropriate_register**None**7**They've>> done it <<so it means they**T27**Absence_explanation**None**7**so they>> <<do not**T26**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don't>> care about rules and other important things in the world of sport competitions. Moreover, there are some <<athletes**T4**Spelling**None**8**athelets>> who have been caught <<twice or more**T29**Redundant_comp**None**19**twice or more times>>. I think, such people <<should not**T23**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn't>> take part in any <<competition ever**T5**Spelling**None**17**competitione Ever>> again, because they <<do not**T22**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don't>> <<respect the rules that they have to obey**T30**Punctuation**None**41**respect the rules, that they have to obey>>.
To sum up, I would like to say that if <<a sportsman**T21**Articles**None**13**the sportsman>> made a mistake <<once,**T19**Punctuation**None**4**once>> he <<deserves**T20**Tense_choice**None**8**deserved>> to be forgiven.
