<<These days**T1**Redundant**None**20**In these day and age>> we can observe <<such a**T14**suggestion**None**4**such>> situation that small businesses <<don't**T2**Spelling**None**4**dont>> have <<the same**T15**suggestion**None**8**an equal>>l acess to market as the large. In many developing countries a huge diversity of small local companies are being <<displaced**T47**Spelling**None**9**displased>> by the multinational <<brands**T29**Spelling**None**6**brends>>. In my <<essay**T31**Spelling**None**6**eassay>> I would like <<to find out**T19**suggestion**None**12**to found out>> whether it has some benefits or not.
On the one hand, w#DELETE#7#e have a vivid disadvantage is that our products will be much more expensive w<<if we have**T4**Conditionals**None**17**when we will have>>only big companies. The situation on the market will be v<<absolutely awful**T6**lex_item_choice**None**10**very awful>>because of the monopoly s<<as**T8**Linking_device**None**7**such as>>we will have only big companies with the same goods a#DELETE#93#nd companies that have to make some profit and it wont be successful without small companies.A<<As a result**T7**suggestion**None**13**As the result>> the owners of big companies will increase t<<prices**T9**suggestion**None**10**the prices>>of the goods a<<, and**T20**suggestion**None**3**and>>it will have a bad impact on costumers.
On the other hand, we will have products and goods wi<<of**T21**suggestion**None**4**with>>he good quality.

Another bright advantage for having only big companies is that the<<the customers**T41**Spelling**None**13**the costumers>>ll have the<<a more diverse range**T25**suggestion**None**22**the most diverse range>> goods than in small companies.Usually, big multinational companies are located in multi-million territories that allows to offer the buyer a huge number of possible options for one product.It can be of different colors, shapes.
To sum up all my thoughts, I would like to sat <<say**T13**Spelling**None**3**sat>>t even though mult<<having only multinational companies**T12**suggestion**None**23**multinational companies>>e its drawbacks but the benefits far outweigh.So, it is much better to have larg<<a few large companies**T26**suggestion**None**15**large companies>>n smal<<many small ones**T27**suggestion**None**5**small>>
