These two pie charts show us how many different goods and products <<are**T1**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> shipped by train and trucks in <<percentages**T2**Noun_number**None**10**percentage>>.

The <<parts**T6**Noun_number**Dependent_change**4**part>> of transported manufactured goods by both means of transport <<are**T7**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> almost the same – 25-28 %.
