The charts below provide the <<data in percentages**T1**Word_order**None**15**percentage data>> on goods transportation between countries in Eastern Europe during 2008.

Overall, it is clearly seen that manufactured goods were #DELETE#6#one of the most actively transported items by rail and by road. Non-metallic minerals appeared to be transported in a considerably less proportion in both charts (6% <<was transported**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**transported>> by rail, 13% <<was transported**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**transported>> by road).

According to the graph that illustrates transportation by rail, it is evident that meatals and manufactured goods outnumbered other goods <<, marking 35% and 25% respectively**T5**Punctuation**None**32**marking 35% and 25% respectively>>. Machinery was transported twice as many as non-metallic minerals <<and reached**T6**Tense_choice**None**8**reaching>> 12%. Common numbers <<were depicted**T7**Voice**None**8**depicted>> by chemicals and food products (11%).

Apparently, <<the tendency**T8**Articles**None**8**tendency>> varies in the second graph. The most transported goods were food products, <<they surpassed**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**surpassing>> metals in threefold proportion and <<reached**T11**Tense_choice**None**8**reaching>> 30%. Manufactured goods outweighed machinery at 14 times. <<Chemicals and non-metalic good were transported in almost common proportions**T12**Standard**None**78**In almost common proportions chemicals and non-metallic goods were transported>>, marking 16% and 13% respectively.
