It has been known that in the modern world the one uneasy problem of illegal pirate copies of music and films becomes more popular than in <<the previous century**T1**Articles**None**16**previous century>>. Many people involved in music or films production claim that they lose <<a very big amount of money**T2**Articles**None**24**very big amount of money>> because of the pirating. However, there is another group of people, <<who**T3**Conjunctions**None**5**which>> <<believe**T4**Agreement_errors**None**8**believes>> that different <<types**T5**Spelling**None**5**tupes>> of art should be free for people, as they belong to all people in the world. Both groups of people have their own <<arguments**T6**Noun_number**None**8**argument>>, and it would be interesting to <<analyze**T7**lex_item_choice**None**4**know>> them and decide whether or not pirating is a bad thing.
The first group of people <<that**T8**Often_confused**None**5**which>> <<supports**T9**Agreement_errors**None**7**support>> the “anti-pirating” point of view <<claims**T10**Agreement_errors**None**5**claim>> that pirating damages <<the property right**T13**Noun_attribute**None**28**the right of pirate property>> which is one of the fundamental <<rights**T14**Noun_number**None**5**right>> of all <<humankind**T15**lex_item_choice**None**5**humen>>. “#DELETE#5#Every <<Intellectual**T18**Capitalisation**Dependent_change**12**intellectual>> <<Intellectual property**T17**Noun_number**None**10**properties>> <<belongs**T19**Agreement_errors**None**6**belong>> to one who produces <<it**T20**Agreement_errors**None**4**them>>” – they <<say**T21**Tense_choice**None**4**said>>. <<They also usually say**T22**Standard**None**22**Also, They usually say>> that <<piracy**T23**Category_confusion**None**8**pirating>> <<damages**T24**Spelling**None**6**damges>> incomes of musicians and filmmakers, so they <<warn**T25**lex_item_choice**None**5**worry>> others #DELETE#19#about the situation that the worldwide music and film industry becomes less productive and more dependent of government (which affects the quality of all types of art).
The second group of people <<that**T27**Often_confused**None**5**which>> <<supports**T28**Agreement_errors**None**7**support>> <<piracy**T29**Category_confusion**None**8**pirating>> usually refers to the idea of “free intelectual belongings”. They proclaim that only private (not intellectual) <<property**T30**Noun_number**None**10**properties>> can exist. Every mental idea produced by anybody belongs to everybody. For example, <<a famous musician**T31**Articles**None**15**famous musician>> <<Philipp**T32**Spelling**None**8**Phillipe>> Kirkorov <<once said**T33**Tense_choice**None**13**has once said>> that he <<was**T34**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> ready to spread his music among people for free as real <<art**T35**Noun_number**None**4**arts>> is more important than “real” money. It’s <<a very subjective statement**T36**Articles**None**25**very subjective statement>> to my point of view.
<<In conclusion,**T39**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I would like to summarize all <<arguments**T40**Noun_number**None**8**argument>> and give my point of view. I definitely agree with the second group of people <<, as**T41**Punctuation**None**2**as>> I think pirating has <<a slight influence**T42**Articles**None**16**slight influence>> on <<incomes**T44**Spelling**None**8**in comes>> of musicians and film makers. Moreover, I suppose that such ideological idea of “anti-pirating” <<promotes**T45**Spelling**None**7**promots>> social inequality and <<harms**T46**Agreement_errors**None**4**harm>> the spirit of collectivism. So, <<having summarized**T51**lex_item_choice**None**21**in order to summarize>> previous <<arguments**T47**Spelling**None**10**arguements>>, I suppose that <<arguments**T48**Spelling**None**10**arguements>> <<of**T51**Prepositions**None**4**from>> the first group are irrelevant. So, the second group is definitely right.
