Today young people commit crimes more often than they did years ago. There are a few reasons for that. In this essay I will try to give causes of this <<tendency**T16**Spelling**None**8**tandency>> and <<suggest a solution**T3**Articles**None**8**solution>> that people who are around youngsters <<should**T17**Spelling**None**6**chould>> use to make sure that this trend will stop developing.
Firstly, nowadays almost all teenagers use social networks that are full of v<<violence**T15**Spelling**None**8**violance>>and cruelty. There are a lot of people in the internet who try to bring children to i<<illegal**T13**Spelling**None**7**illigal>>groups who m<<commit**T14**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>>crimes every day. Young people are very sensitive and easily m<<manipulated**T12**Spelling**None**11**manapulated>>which leads to them joining these groups. What is more, news that a<<is**T7**Tense_form**None**3**are>>s<<shown on**T20**Prepositions**None**8**shown in>>television, u<<unfortunately**T8**Spelling**None**13**unfourtunatly>> can be an example for children that a<<may have**T10**Modals**None**12**have, maybe,>>some mental problems. These k<<kinds**T11**Noun_number**None**4**kind>>of reports could potentially be the reason why teenagers can have thoughts and ideas of committing some sort of crime. Moreover, children h<<play**T21**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>>computer games that are often very cruel and teenagers l<<learn about violence from them**T22**Standard**None**30**learn from them about violence>>

Nevertheless, there are always ways to prevent or even solve this problem. Parents, for instance, can gar<<guard**T5**Spelling**None**5**garde>>eir children from social media till certain age. It is possible that teens without it won't even have an idea how to commit a crime. Another approach to this problem is for teachers in schools and , if it is neccessary, in universities cre<<to create**T23**Infinitive_constr**None**6**create>>subject from which teenagers will learn that vio<<violence**T4**Spelling**None**8**violance>> never a solution for any problem, that everything can be talked out.

To sum up, it is true that young people make <<commit**T2**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>>t more crimes than before because of social networking sites that were invented or bad examples in real life,<<life; however,**T3**Punctuation**None**13**life,however,>>an prevent it and make sure that children are safe.
