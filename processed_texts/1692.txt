Nowadays there exists a controversial problem connected with international sports. This problem is the consumption of illegal medicine which is expanding in the whole world. There are <<different points of view**T6**Articles**None**28**the different points of view>>: some people think that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from sport only for <<limited time**T7**Countable_uncountable**None**14**a limited time>>, while others think that they should be excluded from competing forever. <<In my essay,**T8**Punctuation**None**11**In my essay>> I will discuss both views and <<provide**T9**Word_choice**None**4**give>> my own opinion.
I think that a lifetime ban for professional athletes who were caught using illegal drugs may have some negative <<aspects**T10**Articles**None**5**sides>>. <<First,**T11**Prepositions**None**8**At first>>, even modern procedures of analysis can cause mistakes. If a sportsman or a sportswoman is caught on something that he/she <<did not**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn't>> do, it will be totally unfair. Such mishap might ruin one's career or even life. <<Secondly**T5**Derivation**None**9**At second>>, the problem of choosing which drugs are legal and which are not is controversial itself. For example, an athlete can use drugs, which <<are not**T12**Voice**None**11**are get not>> illegal. The next day or week this drug is proclaimed illegal. What is he/she going to do? So, a severe punishment can be extremely unfair.
This is the reason why many people say that athletes should be banned only for a <<limited**T3**Word_choice**None**10**restricted>> period of time. I think that this view is far more fair and conscious. If an athlete is caught on using illegal drugs, he/she can have time to think about this problem. If an athlete is eager to return to professional competition, he/she will never use these drugs in <<the future**T1**Articles**None**6**future>>.
As for me, I think that a strict punishment is not necessary. I agree <<with**T2**Spelling**None**5**withe>> the second point of view. If an athlete <<does not**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**7**doesn't>> want to return to sport, he <<does not have to do**T15**Modals**None**6**can do>> it.
