<<Illegal**T1**Spelling**None**7**Illigal>> downloading and copying <<are**T23**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> a crime. In my opinion, I think it is a big problem in media industy.
If you want to create a great product, for example, <<a film**T2**Articles**None**4**film>>, you need to have <<a producer**T3**Articles**None**8**producer>>, actors, <<a director**T4**Articles**None**8**director>>, <<a plot**T5**Articles**None**4**plot>> and etc. This is a big <<work**T7**Often_confused**None**3**job>> <<, and**T8**Punctuation**None**3**and>> it is also not free. People download films <<on**T9**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet <<, because of that**T10**Punctuation**None**15**because of that>> they do not go to cinemas for <<premieres**T11**Spelling**None**9**premieras>>. They <<prefer to watch**T13**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**12**prefer watch>> it <<at**T12**Prepositions**None**2**in>> home, where they do not pay money for tickets. I agree that sharing the product should be <<punished**T14**lex_item_choice**None**7**punched>>. There is a huge <<illegal**T15**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> industry <<which**T16**Spelling**None**4**wich>> <<has**T17**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> money when sharing media product before official date of release because of views <<on**T18**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Net. There are groups in social media with <<illegal**T19**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> content having <<a big audience**T20**Articles**None**12**big audience>>, and <<they rise sharply**T21**Standard**None**17**they sharply rise>>.
To sum up, <<illegal**T22**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> sharing and downloading never stop. <<People always want to watch a new film or listen to new music even if it is a crime and**T27**Abs_comp_clause**None**87**People always want to watch a new film or listen to new music even if it is a crime and>>
