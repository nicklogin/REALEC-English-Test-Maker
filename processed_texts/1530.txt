The issue of using illegal drugs in the field of proffecional sport is relevant all over the world. The discussion of this topic is now especially heated in Russia, because a lot of russians sporsmen were banned from competing in the Olympic games due to the medical tests which showed they had been taking illegal drugs. However, there are arguments on whether the sportsmen who were caught cheating this way should be banned from competing for the whole lives or just for some time. There are both advantages and disadvantages in those ways of dealing with this problem.
First of all, we should keep in mind that spotsmen, especially young ones, can be influenced by their coaches. That is why young athlets should be educated and taughted by their parents not to take any medications from others without talking to parents. Some people think that some people could have just made a huge mistake using illegal drugs but that mistake should not be crucial and should not destroy their careers. Moreover, come people claim that the drugs found in some sportsmens blood are not drugs, but just medications, which are necessary for those athlets health.
However, all those points are not easily checked and some people say those points cannot be used as an excuse for taking prohibited medications. I personally think that the athlets caught taking drugs should be excluded from the competition forever, but the key is to educate sporsmen more, especially in the field of sport law.
