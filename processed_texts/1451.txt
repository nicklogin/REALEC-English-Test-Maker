As <<it is clearly seen**T1**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**clearly seen>> from <<the graphs**T2**Articles**None**6**graphs>>, Rio de Janeiro  mive not than Yakutsk. About <<that**T3**Ref_device**None**2**it>> can say <<the minimal temperature**T4**Articles**None**19**minimal temperature>>: in July. In Rio de Janeiro <<the temperature line**T5**Articles**None**16**temperature line>> on maximum or minimum <<is more stable**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**more stable>> than the same lines in Russia. In Brazil the highest temperature <<was recorded**T7**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**recorded>> in <<January**T8**Spelling**None**7**Sanyary>>, it was about 30^C, and in Russia <<the highest point**T9**Articles**None**13**highest point>> is 25^C in July. In Yakutsk <<the temperature**T10**Articles**None**11**temperature>> slowly <<raises**T11**Spelling**None**8**raise up>> from January to July and than <<it reduces**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**reduce>> to December. <<The line**T13**Articles**None**4**Line>> of maximum differs from <<the minimum**T14**Articles**None**7**minimum>> <<in 5-15^C**T15**Prepositions**None**10**for 5-15^C>>. <<At the same time**T16**lex_item_choice**None**12**In that time>> in Rio de Janeiro that #DELETE#8#space of difference <<is more stable**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**more stable>> â€“ about 15^C. By the way, <<the temperature**T19**Articles**None**11**temperature>> in Rio de Janeiro <<is not so stable**T20**Absence_comp_sent**None**13**not so stable>>. In July it <<raises**T21**Agreement_errors**None**5**raise>> down from 30^C to 25. That is <<a little**T22**Articles**None**6**little>> but downgrade. And this point <<it stays**T23**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**stay>> in town for 3 or 4 months. As <<it is clearly seen**T24**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**clearly seen>> from that summary, Rio has higher and more stable lines of temperature, but in Yakutsk it changes from month to month.
