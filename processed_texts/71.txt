<<Nowadays**T1**Spelling**None**7**Nowdays>>, we can <<face**T2**lex_item_choice**None**4**view>> a big conflict between film/music creators and <<people**T3**Articles**None**10**the people>> who prefer downloading audio/video files #DELETE#3#for from the internet.
Firstly, from my point of view, copying and sharing music or films breaks <<private property right**T6**Articles**None**26**the private property right>> <<, but**T7**Punctuation**None**3**but>>, in my opinion, the main reason why #DELETE#2#do people <<make pirate copies**T9**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> illegally, is that <<a price**T11**Articles**None**9**the price>> <<of**T12**Prepositions**None**3**for>> <<discs**T13**lex_item_choice**None**5**songs>> and films is too high. For example, <<the computer game “Fifa 17”**T14**Articles**None**23**computer game “Fifa 17”>> costs over 2500 roubles, which is too much for a game. So, if <<producers**T15**Articles**None**13**the producers>> want to get more money, they should cut <<prices**T16**Articles**None**10**the prices>>, which will <<reduce**T17**lex_item_choice**None**8**increase>> <<demand for**T18**Prepositional_noun**None**9**demand on>> illegal production. <<So**T19**Punctuation**None**3**So,>> I think<< that**T20**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> punishing people is too strict <<, because**T21**Punctuation**None**7**because>> there are <<different ways**T23**lex_item_choice**None**19**checks and balances>> #DELETE#14#which are able to solve <<the problem**T24**Articles**None**12**this problem>> of pirate copies.
Secondly, I suppose that #DELETE#24#the other matter is that the <<internet security**T25**Spelling**None**17**internet-security>> is #DELETE#7#working not effective enough. It is so because we can all <<see**T28**lex_item_choice**None**4**view>> that all these pirate programmes have <<free access to them**T61**Absence_explanation**None**11**free access>>. If <<the government**T31**lex_item_choice**None**9**the state>> <<took**T34**Tense_choice**None**16**would have taken>> more <<action**T33**Noun_number**None**7**actions>> in these aspects, we<< just**T32**Punctuation**None**7**, just,>> <<wouldn't be able to find**T35**Tense_choice**None**19**couldn’t have found>> these files <<, which**T36**Punctuation**None**5**which>> <<would lead**T37**Tense_choice**None**15**would have lead>> to buying <<licensed**T38**Category_confusion**None**7**license>> disks <<, because**T39**Punctuation**None**7**because>> <<it**T40**Often_confused**None**4**this>> <<would be**T41**Tense_choice**None**15**would have been>> the only <<way**T42**lex_item_choice**None**6**source>>. So, as a result, <<prices**T43**Articles**None**10**the prices>> would stay on the same level <<, and**T44**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<demand**T61**Articles**None**28**demand for pirate production>> <<would be decreasing**T48**Tense_choice**None**18**will be decreasing>> #DELETE#9#new peats. This <<solution**T51**lex_item_choice**None**3**way>> helps to increase <<incomes**T52**lex_item_choice**None**7**amounts>> or creators <<monthly**T53**Spelling**None**5**monty>> <<, and**T54**Punctuation**None**3**and>> at the same time it is not <<so**T55**lex_item_choice**None**5**quiet>> radical <<, because**T56**Punctuation**None**7**because>> there is no necessity to punish people.
In conclusion, I would like to say that this problem is very difficult and the interests of civilians and <<businessmen**T57**Spelling**None**10**businesmen>> are both important <<, and**T58**Punctuation**None**3**and>> the ways <<that**T59**Often_confused**None**5**which>> were described earlier present themselves <<as**T60**lex_item_choice**None**1**a>> <<compromises**T61**Noun_number**None**10**compromise>> between too radical decisions.
