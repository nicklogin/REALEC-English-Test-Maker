Every new film or musical composition give people great opportunities to make pirate copies of them and <<raise**T2**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> great sums of illegal money, stealing <<it**T3**Pronouns**None**3**its>> from real producers. Everybody who make a deal with such material are guilty and <<have to**T4**lex_item_choice**None**6**should>> pay. This essay <<proves**T1**Category_confusion**None**6**proofs>> that it is true but not in all aspects.
As for me, I partly agree with this opinion for some reasons. <<On**T5**Spelling**None**3**One>> the one hand, it is a <<source**T6**Spelling**None**6**sourse>> of unrespectable behaviour <<towards**T7**Prepositions**None**2**to>> the producers of the films and compositions because they had to work hard, spend <<lots**T8**Spelling**None**5**lot’s>> of money to create their ideas <<, and**T9**Spelling**None**3**and>>, what is more, their creations contain the souls of their makers. It is so unpleasant for creators to work for nothing, without any payback. I want to illustrate it with my own experience. I do my best <<at**T10**Prepositions**None**2**in>> university <<, and**T11**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<it hurts**T12**Tense_choice**None**13**it is hurting>> <<feelings**T13**Noun_number**None**7**feeling>> when I kenen that my works <<help**T14**Agreement_errors**None**5**helps>> not truthful students to pass the exam, for example. They steal my creations. My work is my creation, I’m sure.
On the other hand, it is wonderful when you have no time to go to the cinema or musical concert because you study or work all day long and you can <<surf**T15**lex_item_choice**None**6**search>> the Internet and find <<a new film**T16**Articles**None**8**new film>> for <<a good cinema evening**T17**Articles**None**19**good cinema evening>>. No doubt, many students or children want to watch everything but they have not enough money for it. In this case illegal pirate copies is a way out. From my point of view, when my friends don’t want to go to the cinema with me it is more <<pleasant**T18**Spelling**None**8**pleasunt>> to stay at home and <<enjoy**T22**lex_item_choice**None**5**exite>> the composition in <<a warm armchair**T21**Articles**None**13**warm armchair>>.
To sum up, the overall analysis <<can say**T22**Verb_Bare_Inf**None**8**can says>> that people should pay for every good or facility, but we live in the era of technologies and it is an essential part of it, especially if it is impossible to find the guilty one.
