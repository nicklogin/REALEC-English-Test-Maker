The graphs demonstrate the changes in population size, birth and death figures that the USA underwent from 1700 to 2000.
The most significant feature of the graphs provided is the fact that b<<the birth and death rates**T217**Articles**None**21**birth and death rates>>are almost equal. The lines that represent them go through the same changes simultaneously, rising and falling gradually. At the same time the USA population tends to have parallel tendencies in comparison with the ones described above.
From 1750 to 1900 the number of people moving to the USA was growing steadily. However, since 1900 and till th<<2000**T221**Articles**None**8**the 2000>> substantial rise can be observed, when the line representing the population finally re<<reached**T218**Tense_choice**None**7**reaches>>ts peak (about 270 millions of citizens).
The second graph suggests that the birth and death figures were the<<highest**T219**Articles**None**11**the highest>> the beginning of the 18th century, with 39 births and 34 deaths per 1000 people in 1800. Nevertheless, as the population of the country grew, both those rates decreased by almost 35% in 2000.
All in all, the graphs provided complete information on how the birth and death rates as well as the population size of the USA has <<have been transforming**T220**Agreement_errors**None**21**has been transforming>>r past 300 years.
