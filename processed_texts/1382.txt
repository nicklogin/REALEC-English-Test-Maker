<<One**T1**Articles**None**7**The one>> of the most popular question in the world in the <<21st**T2**Absence_comp_colloc**None**2**21>> century is how modernization in technologies has <<influenced**T4**Transitive**None**12**infuenced on>> every person. There are different answers, but many of <<them**T5**Ref_device**None**4**this>> are about disadvantages of technology, because <<exactly**T6**Spelling**None**7**exectly>> modern technology can <<lead**T7**lex_item_choice**None**7**prevent>> to many health problems. 
Firstly, what <<kinds**T10**Noun_number**None**4**kind>> of problems <<can it be**T8**Word_order**None**9**it can be>>? Of course, the first one is that people in modern <<society**T11**Noun_number**None**9**societies>> have <<a high risk**T12**Articles**None**13**the high risk>> of <<having**T13**Category_confusion**None**4**have>> a big weight. They can be fat, because they <<did not**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn’t>> have time to <<do**T15**Category_confusion**None**5**doing>> sports and to improve their health by morning <<exercises**T16**Noun_number**None**8**exercise>>, for example, or by running. They think that the better way to spend time in the morning is watching TW or #DELETE#10#spent time in <<social**T18**Spelling**None**7**sociasl>> medias. 
<<The second problem**T19**Articles**None**14**Second problem>> is that some people <<are  so attracted**T20**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**so attracted>> by their work, that when they <<are**T21**Tense_choice**None**9**have been>> ill, they <<do not want**T54**Inappropriate_register**None**11**didn’t want>> to <<get**T24**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> <<normal help**T25**Articles**None**13**a normal help>> by doctors and <<do not go**T54**Inappropriate_register**None**9**didn’t go>> to the hospital. They think, that some medicaments, which are <<the products**T54**Articles**None**7**product>> of <<technological progress**T30**lex_item_choice**None**17**modern technology>>, can <<help themselves to feel**T54**Word_order**None**26**help to feeling themselves>> better. But <<that**T33**Ref_device**None**2**it>> is not true #DELETE#12#think always.
There is no doubt, that <<both problems**T35**Articles**None**17**the both problems>> can be reduced, first of all, <<government**T36**Spelling**None**9**goverment>> and media should <<help every person**T37**Transitive**None**20**help to every person>> to <<find out**T54**Category_confusion**None**7**knowing>> about simple rules of health care. For instance, <<people**T40**Spelling**None**7**peoples>> should know, that they should think about their weight and sometimes do some <<exercises**T41**Noun_number**None**8**exercise>>. Maybe, once they can go to the work not by <<by car or public transport**T54**Articles**None**11**a transport>>, but by <<bicycle**T54**Articles**None**8**a cycles>>. Of course, they <<should not**T54**Inappropriate_register**None**12**didn’t think>>, that all of their <<problems**T48**lex_item_choice**None**10**treatments>> #DELETE#3#can leave<< becacuse of tablets**T50**Punctuation**None**20**, because of tablets>>. 
In conclusion, there are much more #DELETE#9#number of health <<problems**T53**Noun_number**None**7**problem>>. Also, during the time. That number <<will increase**T54**Tense_choice**None**15**will increasing>>.
