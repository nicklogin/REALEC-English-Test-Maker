The pie diagrams show transportation of goods in Eastern Europe. There are two possible ways of transporting, by road and by rail, which are demonstrated on the charts.
As can bee seen from the diagrams, metal is usally transported by rail (35% of whole transportation against only 11% by road). Manufactured goods have almost equal percentage 25% and 28% by rail and by road. Certainly, itis preferred to use railway to move machinery, so the share of it in the first chart is 10% higher than in the second one. It is also more convenient to transport food by roads, that is why 30 percent of raod transportation is food products while it is only 11 percent in "rail" chart. Chemicals have comparable share in both way of tranpportation whereas Non-meallic minerals are mostly shipped by road.
In conclusion, rail is more convenient to transport machinery and metals while the road is preferable for moving food products and non-metallic minerals.
