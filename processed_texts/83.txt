One of the widely discussed issues <<nowadays**T1**Spelling**None**7**nowaday>> is <<the question**T2**Articles**None**8**question>> <<of**T3**Prepositions**None**5**about>> <<illegal**T4**Spelling**None**8**illeagal>> content <<on**T5**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet, partly films and music. It is <<undeniable**T6**Spelling**None**10**undenaible>> that it has some controversial aspects. I agree, with <<the statement**T8**Articles**None**14**this statement>><< that**T9**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> nowadays such actions as <<downloading**T10**Category_confusion**None**8**download>> pirate copies should be punished.
Firstly, <<it is unfair and disrespectful**T11**Negation**None**34**it is not unfair and disrespectful>> <<to**T13**Spelling**None**2**tp>> get #DELETE#4#some products without paying <<any**T15**Often_confused**None**4**some>> fee. Musicians, producers and <<other**T16**Agreement_errors**None**6**others>> people of art do their own job and should be paid for it. <<They**T52**lex_item_choice**None**5**these>> #DELETE#23#represents of such work spend their time to create really important and beatiful things #DELETE#12#in our world. So, we, listeners, <<viewers**T21**Spelling**None**5**viwer>> and so <<on**T22**Spelling**None**3**one>> <<should show respect**T23**Modals**None**12**show respect>> their work and <<help them**T25**Absence_explanation**None**4**help>> in <<our**T24**Agreement_errors**None**5**their>> ways. Last but not the least, <<the modern world**T26**lex_item_choice**None**12**todays world>> is <<the world of money**T27**Articles**None**14**world of money>> <<, where**T28**Punctuation**None**5**where>> <<the most useless**T29**lex_item_choice**None**12**the smallest>> jod is paid. <<Noone**T30**Spelling**None**6**No one>> <<wants**T31**Agreement_errors**None**4**want>> to get <<something**T32**lex_item_choice**None**7**nothing>> for time<< or**T33**Conjunctions**None**1**,>> brain power <<that**T34**lex_item_choice**None**5**which>> <<can be used**T52**Modals**None**10**were using>> <<to**T38**Prepositions**None**3**for>> <<create**T37**Category_confusion**None**8**creation>> something new. Why we shouldnâ€™t pay for <<a film**T39**Articles**None**4**film>> or <<a song**T40**Articles**None**4**song>>? We really should #DELETE#2#to do this. Because fees could be used to help poor people in Africa, or, maybe, to create <<a new film**T42**Articles**None**12**the new film>> or song.
In this way, I would like to say that in our modern society and <<world**T43**Spelling**None**4**word>> people should respect <<each other**T44**Noun_number**None**11**each others>> and their <<work**T45**Noun_number**None**5**works>>. One <<way**T56**lex_item_choice**None**3**the>> #DELETE#24#thinks which help we can <<to express**T54**Infinitive_constr**None**7**express>> <<our feelings**T55**Noun_number**None**11**our feeling>> is to pay some amount of money <<as gratitude**T46**lex_item_choice**None**12**for thankful>> and help in future development. Buying illegal pirate copies we encourage <<those who are criminals**T47**Defining**None**33**those, who are criminalscriminals>> <<, and**T50**Punctuation**None**3**and>> with these actions we make our society more <<vicious**T51**lex_item_choice**None**5**badly>> and give an awful example <<to**T52**Prepositions**None**3**for>> our children and descendants.
