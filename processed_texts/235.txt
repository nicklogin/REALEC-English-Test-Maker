<<In our days,**T1**Punctuation**None**11**In our days>> there are a lot of people, who would like to download music and films on the <<Internet**T2**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> for free, but very often it leads to loosing a lot of money by artists and producers. I suppose<< that**T3**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<Internet**T4**Spelling**None**8**Inlernet>> <<pirates**T5**Spelling**None**6**pirats>> should be punished <<, and**T6**Punctuation**None**3**and>> I will give my <<arguments**T7**Spelling**None**10**arguements>> in the essay.
Firstly, it is known that people of art usually earn money by selling copies of their discs with films and songs. It is written on each copy<< that**T8**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> people <<should**T9**Modals**None**5**could>> not copy and share this product without special rights. In <<the whole world**T10**Articles**None**11**whole world>> this activity is illegal. In the era of the <<Internet**T11**Spelling**None**8**Ynternet>> it became very difficult to control the situation with <<authors**T12**Possessive**None**7**authors>> right, that is why the punishment should become more <<strict**T13**Category_confusion**None**8**strictly>> for this type of theft.
There is no way of developing in art industry, while internet pirates will share their pirate copies of songs and <<films**T14**Noun_number**None**4**film>>, <<because**T15**Spelling**None**7**becouse>> authors and producers will have no money to create and record new cdâ€™s or to make new films. It <<is very often believed**T16**Standard**None**22**is believed very often>> that songs and films are very expensive and <<cost**T17**Spelling**None**5**coast>> much more than they should really <<cost**T18**Spelling**None**5**coast>>, however there is no one #DELETE#6#person who <<tries**T20**Agreement_errors**None**3**try>> to get an expensive car for free just <<because**T21**Spelling**None**7**becouse>> it <<costs**T22**Agreement_errors**None**4**cost>> too much in his opinion.
<<In**T23**Prepositions**None**2**To>> conclusion, any theft should be punished<< because**T25**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> of many reasons. Copying and sharing products of art on the <<Internet**T26**Spelling**None**8**Inlernet>> is very easy, but it leads to degradation of industry. There will be no economical <<stimulus**T27**Spelling**None**8**stimules>> to produce new films or to write songs if <<there**T28**lex_item_choice**None**2**it>> will not be good <<authors**T29**Possessive**None**7**authors>> law in the country.
