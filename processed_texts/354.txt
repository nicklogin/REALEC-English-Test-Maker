We often hear from the news about crimes which are committed by youngsters today. Why <<have**T1**Tense_choice**Dependent_change**3**did>> the crime rates <<increased**T2**Tense_choice**Dependent_change**8**increase>> so sharply and who is <<responsible**T3**Spelling**None**11**responsidle>> for such behavior?
