The diagrams illustrate the persentage of goods, transported by rail and <<by road**T1**Lack_par_constr**None**4**road>> between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008. <<Generally speaking,**T2**Punctuation**None**18**Generally speaking>> both ways of transporting goods are used mostly <<for**T5**Spelling**None**3**far>> manufactured goods, <<metals**T3**Spelling**None**6**melats>> and food products. The biggest part of railway transportation is metals with 35%, while food is <<mostly**T6**Category_confusion**None**8**the most>> transporded #DELETE#4#good by road with 30%. For both ways of transportation almost <<a third**T9**Articles**None**10**third part>> is manufactured goods with 25% <<carried by rail**T10**Absence_explanation**None**7**by rail>> and 28% by road. Chemicals and non-metallic minerals are <<transported by road more than by rail**T17**Absence_explanation**None**24**more transported by road>>. This difference is not that significant as these two goods <<together**T4**Spelling**None**9**togeather>> have almost <<the same**T13**Articles**None**4**same>> parts of pie charts with 11% and about 3% by rail and 16% and 13% by road. What is more, machinery goods are <<transported by rail morethan by road**T14**Redundant_comp**None**53**more transported by rail with 12%, while 2% with road>>. The main reason for this difference is that machinery <<goods**T15**Noun_number**None**4**good>> <<are**T16**Spelling**None**3**and>> <<not so easily**T17**lex_item_choice**None**4**less>> transportable
