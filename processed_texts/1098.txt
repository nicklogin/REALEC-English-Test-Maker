Food these days comes in greater variety than it ever had. Not only in the biggest cities but all over the countries you may find shops selling delicious goods that can often be imported, which some people think is wrong, believing that food should almost entirely produced “at home”. I partly agree with that for the following reasons.

On the one hand, importing products including food ones has some benefits. From civilian perspective it is really good for it provides big variety, letting any customer get whatever they want and eat the best foods from all over the world. Also this strategy could help the government’s outside economy, because it is well known that export and import deals mean a lot in international relationships. Perhaps, having a food import deal could play a role in a future political situation with that country.

On the other hand, I can see why food import strategy has some minds against it. I have already mentioned international profits ot it, but having its own large food production would make a country more stable and independent in the eyes of others. Further more, this would mean a whole list of “pluses”, from growing employment to developments in technology of agriculture and then some.

In most cases it is often that a certain strategy can be perfect and this is one of them. Food import is different from country to country, but what is certain is that most countries do import food to some extent, which, as I see it, cannot be changed in the world we live in now.
