We are all humans and we are facing the same issues. We want out society to flourish. Nobody wants to be killed, <<mugged**T2**Suffix**None**3**mug>> or so on... So, hardy anyone will deny the fact that reducing crime is very important. But, what should people do to <<minimalise**T3**Voice**None**11**minimalised>> the crimes statictics?
Some of us believe that only the long prison sentences could fight the crime. They also think that killing prisoners for the hard issues those have made isn't a crime itself. M<<More**T4**Capitalisation**None**4**MOre>>than this there are a certain amount of people wishing some of the prisoners to be killed. In the c<<countries**T5**Spelling**None**8**counties>>like m<<Muslim**T6**Capitalisation**None**6**muslim>>ones and in the some of the A<<American**T7**Spelling**None**8**Amirican>>states it isn't a big deal and such thing happens quite often. But it does not goes along with the principle's of correct law.
And in Europe such kind of things are prohibited as for residents and ci<<citizens**T8**Spelling**None**9**citizencs>>f the country and so for law institutes. The great ex<<example**T9**Spelling**None**8**exsample>>f minimalising the crime and judging th<<thievs**T10**Spelling**None**6**thiths>>nd killers properly is Sweden. There are the most comfortable prisons in the whole world. They look like a special cities with small houses where the prisoners live and work. The prisoners themselves are around to visit the city ve<<where**T11**lex_item_choice**None**4**very>>he normal people live and shop there.
NEv<<Nevertheless**T12**Capitalisation**None**12**NEvertheless>>e can imagine the same in Russia. Prison is a very expensive institute to run. So we can put all of the prisoners in special set<<settlement**T13**Spelling**None**8**settlent>> even the simple, awful bui<<buildings**T14**Spelling**None**8**builings>>r country alreade have, so the new app<<approaches**T15**Spelling**None**9**approches>> reducing the crime should appeared.
Maybe we should think about anti-unemployed politic, free education for everyone.

Thus, things can get better and there will be no crime.
