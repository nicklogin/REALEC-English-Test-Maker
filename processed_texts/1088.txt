It is widely believed that produce the food that their own population eats more important than import. I’m compleatly against this idea.

First of all I would like to say, that there are some different point of view on this problem. Some people opien that the gouvernement need to produce the food for people, that lives in this countrie. I think this point of view are alive cause people think, that they own gouvernement will live without the food. Also some peopl think so, because they opien that, they countries is the main on the whole world.

On the other hand, there are other point of view, that the import it’s also important for gouvernement. In my opinion, when some countries import the food they make some money, therefore this will be good for economics of this countries. In addition, when countries werk together it will be great for futre world situation. Also, we can ecck at the experiance when our country (Russia) was USSR, and when we didn’t contact with many other countrie, and aim to import as little as possible, and nevertheless we have a bed situation whith import.

In conclusion, to sum up, I would like to say that it is obvious, that countries should not aim to import, because it’s so important  for each countrie, consequently I claim that it’s easy to produce the food for import and for own populatont eats.
