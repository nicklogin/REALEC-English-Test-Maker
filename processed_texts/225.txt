Musicians and <<filmmakers**T1**Spelling**None**11**film-makers>> lose huge amounts of money from illegal pirate copies over the years. There is an opinion that copying and sharing music or films on the <<Internet**T2**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> is <<a theft**T3**Articles**None**5**theft>> and people who download these files, instead of <<buying**T4**Spelling**None**5**bying>> the original discs, should be punished.
It is very clear that those people<< who are making the products**T5**Defining**None**29**, who are making the products>> are losing money from this, but <<, in my opinion,**T6**Punctuation**None**13**in my opinion>> I will likely disagree <<with**T7**Spelling**None**5**whith>> this statement and punishment.
First of all, to <<fight thefts**T8**Transitive**None**17**fight with thefts>> we need to punish not only the ones who are downloading this from the <<Internet**T9**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>, rather than punish those who are copying <<, and after this,**T10**Punctuation**None**14**and after this>> spreading and sharing those materials illegally, because those people are most likely <<commiting**T11**Spelling**None**10**cominiting>> the crime, not the other ones who are just taking the maximum from a free-place like an <<Internet**T12**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>.
<<Secondly, most of the time the main process of selling those products is not the right one.**T15**Abs_comp_clause**None**91**Secondly, most of the timetime the main process of selling those products not the right one>>. <<The main argument**T16**Articles**None**13**Main argument>> against modern system is about not having a <<chance**T17**Spelling**None**6**chanse>> to <<overview**T18**Spelling**None**8**overwiev>> the material which we are bying. <<If you go to watch a film or to listen to some music discs,**T20**Punctuation**None**58**If you go to watch a film or to listen to some music discs>> you <<must pay**T21**Modals**None**11**must to pay>> for it before you will get <<an access**T22**Articles**None**6**access>> to <<overview**T23**Spelling**None**8**overwiev>> it, when, <<, in my opinion,**T24**Punctuation**None**13**in my opinion>> it is not very pleasant, because you are paying for a product, when it can appear as a low-quality one or which will not satisfy <<you**T25**Pronouns**None**8**yourself>>.
Therefore, <<in my opinion,**T26**Punctuation**None**13**in my opinion>> this process may be more pleasant in a way<< when**T27**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> firstly you can download it for-free <<, and**T28**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<if you satisfy with a product,**T29**Punctuation**None**29**if you satisfy with a product>> you can <<invest**T31**lex_item_choice**None**4**fund>> any amount of money <<for**T32**Prepositions**None**2**to>> a content-maker. <<However,**T33**Punctuation**None**7**However>> with the discs it is obvious that we <<must pay**T34**Modals**None**11**must to pay>> for it, because that is <<physical**T35**lex_item_choice**None**9**touchable>> product <<with money spent on them**T37**Standard**None**24**with spent money on them>>. But mostly it <<depends**T38**Agreement_errors**None**6**depend>> on the peopleâ€™s awareness of product price, if they are aware, the money will come to producers.
