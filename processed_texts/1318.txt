People often suppose that the popularity of modern technology in a daily life leads to different health problems. Indeed, the 20th century <<has totally changed**T1**Tense_choice**None**15**totally changes>> the lifestyle of people, because there have been invented some unbelievable things like the Internet or a mobile phone. Nevertheless, the idea that people <<depend on**T2**Prepositional_verb**None**9**depend in>> gadgets and technology often <<popes up**T4**lex_item_choice**None**6**sounds>> in the <<society**T3**lex_item_choice**None**11**environment>>. 

So, such <<common**T5**lex_item_choice**None**5**total>> interest to using technology <<cannot**T6**Spelling**None**7**can not>> stay unnoticed <<in the perspective of people's health**T35**Prepositions**None**19**for people’s health>>. The first issue is that the modern style of life (with constant using of technology) <<conftonts**T9**lex_item_choice**None**12**contrihifies>> to ‘sitting’ style of life, because almost all modern gadgets have an aim to make <<our life**T10**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**life>> more simple and comfortable. Sometimes #DELETE#2#or two places with four walls start to be <<the only areas**T12**Articles**None**10**only areas>> of human’s life. This man does not need even walking, because the Internet broadens horizons and gives new experience. Gradually, a man can become too fat or <<he**T35**lex_item_choice**None**16**stop to see well>>, <<besides,**T15**Punctuation**None**7**besides>> such style of life <<affects heart**T17**Transitive**None**16**affects on heart>>, which <<becomes**T18**Tense_form**None**6**become>> too weak, so <<the problem**T19**Articles**None**9**a problem>> of <<heart attack**T21**Articles**None**14**a heart-attach>> <<becomes**T22**lex_item_choice**None**12**starts to be>> real. People should understand that the natural <<rhythm**T23**Spelling**None**5**rhytm>> of life must include workouts and sport, #DELETE#2#so even if a man has a <<job related to modern technology**T25**Punctuation**None**34**job, related to modern technology,>> he should be sporty.

Another problem of using technology is that <<our ability**T27**Possessive**None**11**the ability>> to live without them <<is not so obvious**T28**lex_item_choice**None**10**can reduce>>. Modern technology <<surround**T29**Tense_form**None**9**surrounds>> people since <<childhood**T30**Articles**None**13**the childhood>>, <<consequently,**T31**Punctuation**None**12**consequently>> if a man is in any difficult problem, which obliges him to undertake <<the responsibility**T32**Articles**None**16**a responsibility>> about <<his own life**T33**Possessive**None**8**own life>>, he can loose <<control**T34**Articles**None**11**the control>> and he <<will certanly not survive**T35**Tense_choice**None**23**certanly not to survive>>.
