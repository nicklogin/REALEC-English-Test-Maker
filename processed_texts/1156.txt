Musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year from illegal pirate copies. Copying and sharing music or films on the <<Internet**T1**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> is theft and people who download these files<< instead of buying the original discs**T2**Punctuation**None**39**, instead of buying the original discs,>> should be punished. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

First of all, in <<the modern age**T4**Articles**None**10**modern age>> of <<the Internet**T41**Articles**None**8**internet>> and technologies people have fun in many ways and the most popular way is sharing music and films on the <<Internet**T6**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. 

#DELETE#2#In the first place in this question should take #DELETE#12#into account <<the fact that**T10**Punctuation**None**14**the fact, that>> many people <<cannot**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> afford to buy music or <<films**T12**Noun_number**None**4**film>>. These people <<suppress their needs by**T13**Prepositional_verb**None**25**suppress their needs with>> downloading and sharying films or music on the <<Internet**T15**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. <<This**T16**Ref_device**None**5**These>> way, of course, is <<the easiest**T17**Superlative_adj**None**13**the most easy>> and <<the most comfortable**T18**Superlative_adj**None**11**comfortable>>. 

But <<if you look from the producers and musicians points of views,**T20**Punctuation**None**59**if you look from the producers and musicians points of view>> it brings huge loses. Imagine that you <<have done**T21**Tense_choice**None**3**did>> a great job and in the end you <<do not**T22**Tense_choice**None**7**did not>> receive suffycient payment for <<this**T23**Ref_device**None**5**these>> work. <<In this situation**T24**Punctuation**None**18**In this situation,>> anyone would feel cheated because any work and job<<, especially creative,**T25**Punctuation**None**21**, especially creative>> must be paid. After all, the creativity and <<art**T26**Noun_number**None**4**arts>> bring people pleasure and #DELETE#12#very good to <<relaxation**T27**Category_confusion**None**5**relax>>.

In <<conclusion**T29**lex_item_choice**None**7**the end>>, I am <<on the opinion**T30**Prepositions**None**14**of the opinion>> that <<films**T31**Articles**None**9**the films>> and music should be online, but it should not cost <<to much**T32**Confusion_of_structures**None**7**so much>>. Most often, <<a person**T33**Articles**None**10**the person>> comes to <<an online store**T41**lex_item_choice**None**8**pay site>> and sees a large amount of licensed <<movies**T36**Noun_number**None**5**movie>> and thinks that #DELETE#9#the money <<he**T37**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> could to go and see that film at cinema. Therefore, I agree that online films and music can be <<payed for**T39**Category_confusion**None**3**pay>>, but they <<should not**T40**lex_item_choice**None**6**aren’t>> be #DELETE#2#so expensive.
