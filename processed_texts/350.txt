Nowadays people can face the unprecedented problem of the high level of crimes that are committed by <<young people**T1**Articles**None**16**the young people>>.
To my mind, the main reason for s<<such a tendency**T2**Articles**None**13**such tendency>>is a<<freedom**T32**Articles**None**9**a freedom>>i<<on**T7**Prepositions**None**2**in>>I<<the Internet**T8**Articles**None**8**Internet>><<, where it is not very likely to find censorship on most websites,**T33**Non_defining**None**65**, where it is not very likely to find censorship on most websites>>and also computer games.
To<<To overcome this,**T10**Punctuation**None**16**To overcome this>>a<<parents**T9**Spelling**None**8**parent s>>an restrict th<<children's access**T18**Confusion_of_structures**None**23**the access for children>>o the Internet. First of all, parents can pay money fo<<to**T34**Prepositions**None**3**for>>he specialist, << who**T12**Defining**None**5**, who>>ill install pa<<parental**T29**Category_confusion**None**7**parents>>ontrol on the computer, so<<so that**T4**Linking_device**None**2**so>>hildren would not have any opportunity to visit webpages with specific content. The positive effect from this is that the level of ch<<child**T13**Noun_attribute**None**8**children>>ggression wo<<will really decline**T14**Tense_choice**Parallel_construction**20**would really decline>>since they wo<<will not be**T15**Tense_choice**Parallel_construction**12**would not be>>ble to see violence and crimes. However, there is no guarantee that they wo<<will not be**T16**Tense_choice**Parallel_construction**12**would not be>>ble to watch it in their friend’s house.
Moreover, schools can try to mak<<make children understand**T5**Verb_object_bare**None**27**make children to understand>>e consequences of bad behavior. The idea is that schools should organize special lessons, w<< where**T17**Defining**None**7**, where>>achers will tell children about the rules and morality of our society. Children are#DELETE#17# the ones, who perceive information very well, so they wou<<will grow**T28**Tense_choice**None**10**would grow>> with the knowledge of eta<<appropriate**T30**lex_item_choice**None**6**etalon>>havior. On the other hand, this method can be <<fail to be**T20**Word_choice**None**6**be not>>ccessful, since there is pos<<a possibility**T21**Articles**None**11**possibility>> making the situation worse by con<<a constant reminder**T31**Articles**None**17**constant reminder>>w to live.
All in all, I suppose, that the problem of yout<<juvenile crime**T22**Word_choice**None**13**youths crimes>>sed by violence is not going to be solved in near<<near**T23**Category_confusion**None**6**nearly>>ure because of the <<many issues**T24**Determiners**None**15**the many issues>>ough I think that the parents control is the most effective method today.
