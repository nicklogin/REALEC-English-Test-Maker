<<Crime**T5**Noun_number**Dependent_change**6**Crimes>> <<has**T6**Tense_form**Dependent_change**4**have>> always been <<a serious social issue**T4**Articles**None**20**serious social issue>>. It is even more relevant nowadays, when the <<crime rate**T9**lex_part_choice**None**16**amount of crimes>> rises every year in our country. There are many <<arguments**T8**Spelling**None**10**arguements>> about ways of lowering the <<crime rate**T10**lex_part_choice**None**15**level of crimes>> <<in today's society**T11**Determiners**None**14**in the society>>, so <<I suggest looking**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**10**let's look>> at <<all of the**T12**Determiners**None**4**both>> opinions.
Some people t<<think that**T13**Punctuation**None**11**think, that>>the most effective way of dealing with c<<the criminal problem**T14**Articles**None**16**criminal problem>>is giving longer prison sentences. They say that it makes people more afraid of the punishment for the crimes they could commit, so in this case fear can prevent crimes.
They also state that isolating all the criminals from th<<society**T18**Articles**None**11**the society>>or a long period of time is mu<<very effective**T19**Comparative_constr**None**19**much more effective>>because If<<if**T16**Capitalisation**None**2**If>>ll the cr<<culprits**T20**lex_item_choice**None**9**criminals>>annot commit crimes, the problem is solved, so prison is a perfect me<<way**T21**lex_item_choice**None**7**measure>>f so<<reaching social safety**T22**Absence_comp_sent**None**13**social safety>>Fi<<Finally,**T17**Punctuation**None**7**Finally>>hey say that prison can teach people how to become he<<a productive member**T26**Articles**None**17**productive member>>f th<<society**T25**Articles**None**11**the society>>so sc<<education**T27**Redundant_comp**None**21**schools and education>>n prisons can help people to socialise after le<<their release from**T28**lex_item_choice**None**7**leaving>>h<<jail**T1**lex_item_choice**None**10**the prison>>But there is another opinion. There are people who think that prolonging prison sentences can just make the whole situation worse. Firstly, the<<prison**T32**Articles**None**10**the prison>>nnot make people better. There are<<is**T33**Tense_form**None**3**are>> proper system of prison education in our country, so people in pri<<jails**T36**lex_item_choice**None**7**prisons>>st do not get<<have**T35**lex_item_choice**None**3**get>>p<<an opportunity**T34**Articles**None**11**opportunity>> take any kind of courses. Secondly, the chance of becoming par<<a part**T38**Articles**None**4**part>> the criminal world is much higher in prison, especially for young peo<<people.**T39**Punctuation**None**7**people,>>irdly, just isolating criminals from the<<society**T40**Articles**None**11**the society>>es not stop other people from commiting new crimes.
As for me, I strongly believe that prison can niether stop people from commiting crimes, nor make people better citizens. Prison just ruines people's lives. It is well shown in Shalamov's stories or the <<The Tale of Shawshunk**T44**Punctuation**None**21**The Tale of Shawshank>>Steven King. People in prison can just commit new crimes, because there is no other way for them to live. To conclude, Thou<<though**T7**Punctuation**None**6**Though>>re is an opinion that main measure of dealing with crime issue are <<is**T45**Tense_form**None**3**are>>sons, I so n<<do**T46**Spelling**None**2**so>> agree.
