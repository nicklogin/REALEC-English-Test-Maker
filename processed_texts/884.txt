There are several points of view on reducing crime. <<Some tend to believe that the best way is longer prison sentences, while others argue that there are better ways.**T295**Punctuation**None**113**Some tend to believe that the best way is longer prison sentences. While others argue that there are better ways.>> Both views have their pros and cons. Increasing prison sentences can prevent some people from doing crime as they will know about <<the risk**T297**Articles**None**4**risk>> of spending most of their <<lives**T296**Spelling**None**5**lifes>> in prison. But there is another side of this solution. First of all, <<prisons will take more money from country budget as prison has to spend more on every prisoner**T298**Punctuation**None**103**prisons will take more money. From country budget as a prison will have to spend more on every prisoner>>. <<The second and maybe even more important reason is that**T301**Absence_explanation**None**37**Second and may be even more important>> criminals will <<go on**T303**lex_part_choice**None**6**go for>> <<serious crimes**T302**Articles**None**16**a serious crimes>> to avoid prison. For example, <<a thief**T329**Articles**None**5**thief>> <<will kill**T307**Tense_choice**None**4**kill>> a man <<in order to**T308**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**to>> avoid being <<caught**T309**Spelling**None**8**caughted>>. <<The last problem**T310**Articles**None**12**Last problem>> is connected with the first one. Government will need to <<build**T311**Spelling**None**5**built>> more prisons to keep all criminals. It <<will also take**T312**Tense_choice**None**9**also take>> money from budget. But <<do we have**T313**Interrogative**None**7**we have>> alternative ways? Yes, there are some other possible solutions to prevent crime. <<The first one**T314**Articles**None**9**First one>> is reducing <<the number**T315**Articles**None**6**number>> of unemployed people. A lot of people <<go on**T319**lex_part_choice**None**6**go for>> <<a crime**T316**Articles**None**5**crime>> just because they do not have <<anything**T317**Pronouns**None**9**something>> to <<eat**T318**Spelling**None**2**it>>. Giving them a job can prevent them from <<going on**T320**lex_part_choice**None**9**going for>> <<a crime**T321**Articles**None**5**crime>>. <<The second approach**T322**Articles**None**15**Second approach>> is to start with children. Most of the <<criminals**T323**Suffix**None**6**crimes>> start doing <<illegal things**T324**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**illegal>> <<since**T325**Prepositions**None**11**during from>> <<their childhood**T326**Determiners**None**13**the childhood>>. It is very important for parents or teachers, child <<psychologists**T327**Spelling**None**12**phycologists>> to make sure that <<the child will not go**T331**Absence_explanation**None**14**one do not you>> for a wrong road. Of course, <<there exist many other steps**T328**Abs_comp_clause**None**16**many other steps>> that can help. In my opinion, <<giving criminals longer prisons sentences**T329**Absence_explanation**None**22**longer prison sentence>> certainly is not the right solution, so we have to concentrate on alternative approaches and combine them for better results.
