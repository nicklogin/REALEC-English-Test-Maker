The topic of juvenile <<delinquency**T388**Spelling**None**10**deliquency>> is considered to be one of the most widespread nowadays. Statistics show that the number of crimes committed <<by**T389**Prepositions**None**5**among>> young people has increased during the latest years. In this essay I will provide some reasons for that fact and variants of how to deal with that.

Firstly, it is clear that the modern generation of teenagers and young people is completely different fo<<from**T390**Spelling**None**4**form>>hat was 20 or 30 years ago. More and more young people come fo<<from**T391**Spelling**None**4**form>>eprived communities or families with only one parent, many of them are used to violence and home abuse. This fact, obviously, could not reflect on person's upbringing in a positive way. The second reason is connected to the age of technologies. Every day with the help of mass media and social networks we are bombarded with tons of information and news about murders, robbery, car stealing, kidnapping and so on. In my opinion, it could be considered as a propaganda and could have a bad influence on young people's minds and behaviour.

It goes without saying that this problem needs to be solved as the safety of people is on stake. Probably, some measures can take place at schools, for instance, a short course for all the students on a current situation explaining there is no significant reason to become a criminal. The situation with bulling at schools should be taken under control, as well. Additionally, some courses could be organised for parents because they are the ones responsible for their children's upbringing including their mindsets. As far as I am concerned, people who lacked love and care in their childhood are more likely to become criminals. And finally, the government could make a police control and protecting services more strict and more attentive.

To sum everything up, this problem creates the bond between all the people because most of the criminals have no other choice, it is the only way they can survive in a mode<<the modern world**T392**Articles**None**14**a modern world>> is why it is crucial to understand that the criminal issue has more deep roots starting from our society.
