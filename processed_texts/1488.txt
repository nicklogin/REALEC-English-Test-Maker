Nowaday there is a tendency that <<sportsmen**T1**Noun_number**None**9**sportsman>> who are taking part in serious competitions sometimes decide to use illegal medicine. Many people advocate the view that such kind of stimulating <<physical**T2**Spelling**None**7**fusical>> activity should be limited and the person should not be involved in competitions for about 2 years<<.**T3**Punctuation**None**1**,>>
Others think that in this case the <<athlete**T4**Spelling**None**6**atllet>> should end <<his or her**T5**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> career. I personally think that illegal drugs are enormously <<harmful**T6**Spelling**None**8**harmfull>> for our health and <<athletes**T7**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> should avoid such a sticky situations when somebody says that they used them. There were some cases when people had not very popular illneses and used some <<legal**T8**Spelling**None**6**leagal>> drugs to deal with this <<problem**T9**Spelling**None**8**promblem>>. But the test showed that this medicine was not allowed. In such case it will be <<truly**T10**Spelling**None**6**trully>> unfair to <<ban**T11**Spelling**None**5**banne>> this person forever. <<It'll**T12**Spelling**None**4**I'll>> ruin <<his or her**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> life. Moreover, professional sportsman should gain some qualities to choose a different profession. It will take a lot of time to find another working field and improve some skills. Opponents argue that using illegal drugs may destroy your organism from inside. To avoid it, people should always be afraid to lose all the main <<things**T14**Noun_number**None**5**thing>> they have in life more than become better than others. So it will be a great example of how you shouldn't act if someone is banned for the rest of the life. Also it will help other competitors to take part in honest competition and the drugs test can <<ensure**T15**Spelling**None**6**insure>> them.
<<In conclusion,**T16**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I would like to say that all people should have a second chance. There is a tendency that a person who made a significant mistake should have some time to overthink it and <<to develop**T17**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**develop>> the way how to prevent the same situations in the future. Two years is more than enough to do your best and change the life priorities.
