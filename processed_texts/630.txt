Nowadays air travel is one of the most popular <<types**T1**Spelling**None**4**tipe>> of trasportation. People prefer air machines because it <<seems to be**T2**Confusion_of_structures**None**8**is seems>> more safe and comfortable. But this transport becomes one of the main <<reasons**T3**Noun_number**None**6**reason>> of the global warming and air pollutions.
Some people believe that the air t<<tranport**T4**Noun_number**None**9**tranports>>is one of the easiest w<<ways**T5**Noun_number**None**3**way>>to achieve the country, where you would like to b<<travel to**T6**lex_item_choice**None**2**be>> It i#DELETE#2#s can save a lot of p<<people's**T8**Possessive**None**6**people>>time, because this kind of transport

As far as I am con<<concerned**T20**Spelling**None**8**concernd>>he air travel is not good eno<<enough**T21**Spelling**None**6**enouth>>day. There are usually no chances to stay alive in air craches.
However, all the transport in the world is unsafe.

Then the air travel would not be the reason of air pollution.
