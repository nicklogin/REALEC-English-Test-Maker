The illustrations compare the <<proportions**T1**Noun_number**None**10**proportion>> of the production which is moved between <<the areas**T2**Articles**None**5**areas>> of Eastern Europe in the year 2008. It can be seen that products are delivered by railroads and highways or roads. Overall, the proportion of goods transported by railroad is marginally <<different**T3**Category_confusion**None**6**differ>> <<to**T4**Prepositions**None**4**from>> <<the proportion**T5**Articles**None**10**proportion>> of products supplied by road. 

To start with, the proportion of manufactured production delivered by rail is approximately the same as <<the proportion**T6**Articles**None**10**proportion>> supplied by road. The figures reach 25% and 28% respectively. Moreover, there is a considerable <<difference**T7**Noun_number**None**11**differences>> between <<the transportations**T14**Articles**None**14**transportation>> of food products due to the fact that more food <<was transported**T10**Voice**None**11**transported>> by the road, while only 11% of food production <<was moved**T11**Voice**None**5**moved>> by railroad. Also, the amount of metals supplied by <<rail**T12**Articles**None**8**the rail>> is higher than <<the amount**T13**Articles**None**6**amount>> of metals delivered by road. 

To conclude, there is a marked difference between the <<proportions**T14**Noun_number**None**10**proportion>> of transported goods. However, the similarity is the proportion of delivered manufacturing production.
