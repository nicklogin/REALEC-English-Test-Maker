The graph <<depicts**T2**Spelling**None**6**depics>> the level of unemployment over two years (2014 and 2015). There are <<six**T1**lex_item_choice**None**3**few>> regions in the diagram: North Africa, <<the Middle East**T3**Articles**None**11**Middle East>>, <<the European Union**T4**Articles**None**14**European Union>>, Latin America and South Asia. <<A column**T5**lex_item_choice**None**5**Trend>> #DELETE#8#which is called “Worldwide”, shows the average unemployment rate over the world.
The rate of unemployment <<stayed**T8**Tense_choice**None**5**stays>> steady in such world regions as North Africa and South Asia. <<The worldwide rate**T9**Articles**None**14**worldwide rate>> <<was**T11**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> also stable. <<The Middle East**T12**Articles**None**11**Middle East>> <<showed**T13**Tense_choice**None**5**shows>> <<a downward trend**T14**Articles**None**14**downward trend>> – <<the unemployment rate**T15**Articles**None**17**unemployment rate>> declined for a year. <<We**T16**Capitalisation**None**2**we>> can suppose that <<an increased level of unemployment**T17**Articles**None**31**increased level of unemployment>> in <<the European Union**T19**Articles**None**14**European Union>> <<could correlate**T22**Tense_choice**None**13**can correlate>> with <<an amount of migrants**T20**Articles**None**18**amount of migrants>> from African countries: the more migrants Europe <<took**T21**Tense_choice**None**5**takes>>, the higher <<the level of unemployment**T23**Articles**None**21**level of unemployment>> <<became**T24**Tense_choice**None**7**becomes>>. Statistics over the world didn’t change – the rate stayed the same.
Generally, the highest rate of unemployment <<related**T25**Tense_choice**None**7**relates>> to North Africa. It <<was**T26**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> the poorest region with low economics and GDP, so there <<were**T27**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> <<no**T28**lex_item_choice**None**3**not>> workplaces for population <<, and**T29**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<people**T30**lex_item_choice**None**4**they>> <<needed**T31**Tense_choice**None**4**need>> to run from country. The best stable result <<was**T32**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> shown by South Asia with <<a growing number of factories**T34**Articles**None**27**growing number of factories>>, developing infrastructure, so it <<provided**T35**lex_item_choice**None**14**give across to>> a big amount of workplaces.
