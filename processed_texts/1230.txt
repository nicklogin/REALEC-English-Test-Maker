Nowadays the problem of producing food only for people<< who live in this country**T1**Defining**None**26**, who live in this country>> is quite important.  I totally agree with the above opinion and now I will write several reasons<< why**T2**Punctuation**None**5**, why>> I have this point of view. 

To start with, <<a country**T3**Articles**None**7**country>> which can survive without <<importing**T4**Tense_choice**None**6**import>> products <<from**T5**Prepositions**None**2**to>> other <<countries**T6**lex_item_choice**None**10**government>> is more strong and powerful, because it has <<an independence**T7**Articles**None**12**independence>> <<, and**T9**Punctuation**None**3**and>> economics of other countries <<cannot**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> <<influence**T10**Prepositional_verb**None**12**influence on>> <<different spheres**T11**Articles**None**21**the different spheres>> such as politics, social sphere, economics and others. In addition to this argument, humans who live on the one territory and have great food production, which can solve problems with different <<people's**T12**Possessive**None**6**people>> demands (food demands) <<do not have**T13**Tense_form**None**11**haven’t got>> enough difficulties like starvation or crysis in food industry, so they have insurance in the future days.

On the other hand, some people say<< that**T14**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> in a lot of countries food production <<plays**T15**Tense_form**None**7**is play>> the main rile in their economics and they <<cannot**T16**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> live without importing <<these**T17**Ref_device**None**4**this>> products, because <<of**T18**Prepositions**None**3**for>> some reasons (<<especially,**T20**Punctuation**None**10**especially>> <<these**T19**Ref_device**None**4**this>> reasons depend on climate and location) governments <<cannot**T21**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> produce other types of products, for example, petrol. A wide range of people #DELETE#3#can survive<< because**T22**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> their countries import and export  products. Moreover, many people believe that <<a country**T24**Articles**None**7**country>> which <<imports**T25**Tense_form**None**9**is import>> and also <<exports**T26**Agreement_errors**None**6**export>> different types of <<products**T27**Noun_number**None**7**product>> from natural resourses #DELETE#17#till computers is <<grows**T29**Tense_choice**None**7**growing>> and <<becomes**T30**Agreement_errors**None**6**become>> more technological.
Taking everything into consideration, there are two points of view on the problem of the production and <<importing**T31**Tense_choice**None**6**import>> food to other countries is very controversial, especially for governments, which have only food production. I believe<< that**T32**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> in future years they understand that producing food only for their population <<gives**T33**Agreement_errors**None**4**give>> them independence and <<they will aim**T34**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**aim>> to import as little as possible.
