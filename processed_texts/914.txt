Here we can see two pie diagrams on good transportartion in the Eastern Europe in 2008. So, metals are mostly transported by rail. The difference in the amount is significant â€” 35% in rail tvanspovation to 11% in road transpoctation. On the contrary, food products are mainly transpocted by road (30% in road transportation) than by rail (11% in rail transpoctation). Machinery is well over transported by rail (12%), than by road (2%). Chemicals are slightly more transported by road (16%), than by rail (11%). As for non-metallic minerals, they are more transported by road (13%) than by rail (6%). The manufactured goods has about the same amount in both transportation methods (25% rail, 28% road). We can understand, that the most significant part to rail transportation are metals (35%) and manufactured poods (28%), while in road transportation food products (30%) and manufactured poods (28%) play the main role. We may also conclude that machinery is least transportet by road (2%), while non-metallic minerals has the least shace in rail transpoctation (6%).
