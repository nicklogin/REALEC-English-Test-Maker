Nowadays music and films are very popular kinds of art. People either buy discs or download music and films from the Internet. The latter is a problem for musicians and film producers. Some people think that using the Internet for such purposes is a crime, while others support <<another**T1**Spelling**None**8**anouther>> point of view. 
To begin with, music and films are financed <<very well**T2**lex_item_choice**None**19**with a lot of money>> and using them without buying would lead to financial problems for musicians and film producers. If producers do not get profit from making a movie, they will not have money for new projects. Moreover, film industry consists not only of producers and actors. Also, there are <<owners of cinemas**T3**Articles**None**21**the owners of cinemas>> who will not be able to <<continue to do their business**T4**lex_item_choice**None**23**continue their business>> if everyone <<uses**T5**Tense_choice**None**8**will use>> the Internet for downloading films.
Nevertheless, some critics believe that people should have free access to music and films. Firstly, there is an opinion<< that**T6**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> art should be free for every person <<, because**T7**Punctuation**None**7**because>> it gives people an opportunity to learn more about the world. For example, some films could be used in schools for making edicational process more interesting for children. Secondly, there are people who do not have enough money for buying music discs or films. For instance, children or disabled people usually do not have enough money to buy new films and music. Nevertheless, they may need to listen to music or watch films in order to have common topics for <<talking to people**T8**Prepositional_verb**None**19**talking with people>> in society.
To sum up, there are different reasons for downloading music and films instead of buying them. The Internet provides a lot of opportunities <<to**T9**Prepositions**None**3**for>> people<< ;**T11**Punctuation**None**1**,>> however, musicians and film producers face #DELETE#4#with some problems. Thus, this question remains controversial. Nevertheless, one can agree that <<a free share of music and films**T14**Articles**None**29**free share of music and films>> should be <<available to**T12**Prepositional_adjective**None**13**available for>> people who do not have opportunities for buying discs and tapes.
