Taking illegal drugs in sport is widespread <<phenomenon**T294**Spelling**None**8**phenomen>> today. There are many opinions about punishment (for such athletes from time limited to everlasting ban). To my mind it is actually complicated issue and I'm going to discuss it. 
It is clear that a ban for a limited period seems to be relevant. An <<athlete**T295**Spelling**None**7**athelet>> could consider that as a punishment and understand that this his act migh be valued as a crime. Also for example two years break would'n damage a sport cancer of this participant. Moreover an athelet could use this time for more intensve and fruitful sport doing. However feeling no fullfulment and satisfaction such person can have a desire to take this chance again and be more careful using drugs in the next competition.
The another point in a professional ban for the rest of atlethes' lives. Probably it could be another decent way although it might be called even cruel, because at the other hand the career and of even such life person would be ruined for eternity. According in rent difficulties in thee modern world due with new job searches it's actually strong punishment.
To my mind the way of limited period ban is more better way. If an athelet accepted his or her mistake he (or she) would start to develop the sport career again. However I suppose that if a person uses such illegal drugs the second time it will be actually needed to ban him for the rest of the life. Obviously the issue of taking drugs in sport sphere is really sophisticated issue and it have to being discussed carefully.
