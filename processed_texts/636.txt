There are different opinions about crime reducing. Some people think that the best way is doing prison sentences longer. But on the other hand, there are a lot of <<people who**T331**Defining**None**11**people, who>> do not think that it is a good way. They have some other ideas.
So, we have two opinions here. The first thought is a little strange. Nowadays we have a lot of very comfortable and cool prisons. There people have a<<good meals**T332**Articles**None**12**a good meals>> rooms, libraries. They can do sports in gyms and so on. It is v<<a very popular type**T333**Articles**None**17**very popular type>>of prisons in European countries. So, I do not think that t<<longer prison sentences**T334**Articles**None**27**the longer prison sentences>>is the best way for crime reducing.
Maybe in some other prisons, for example, in Russia this way is better, but not is<<in**T335**Spelling**None**2**is>>he modern prisons. In the Internet there are some photos from Sweden pr<<prisons**T336**Noun_number**None**6**prison>>It is something like ho<<a hotel**T337**Articles**None**5**hotel>>So<<It is so strange.**T340**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**So strange>>But there are<<is**T338**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>>e<<another opinion**T339**Determiners**None**17**the other opinion>>out this problem.Some people give other alternative ways of reducing crime. For example, some works which are useful for other people or maybe some creative and interesting works. For example, they can collect useful rubbish and create some interesting things. The other way of reducing crime is using free psychologists.

But it can not stop a serious murder.
Finally, there are a lot of loyal ways of reducing crime and I think that they can save a lot of people.
