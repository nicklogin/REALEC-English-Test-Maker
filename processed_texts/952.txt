Social networks <<play**T1**lex_part_choice**None**4**have>> <<an important role**T2**Articles**None**14**important role>> in our life today. Nowadays, there are a lot of different types of social networks. Some networks are used for chatting with #DELETE#4#each <<other people**T12**Ref_device**None**6**others>>. In others, we <<take photos and make videos**T5**Lack_par_constr**None**22**make photos and videos>> of everyday life. <<Finally**T6**lex_item_choice**None**10**At the end>>, in networks we communicate with colleagues and search jobs.
<<In**T8**Prepositions**None**2**At>> this graph#DELETE#1#, we can see statistics about percentage of respondents of different ages who <<use**T9**Agreement_errors**None**4**uses>> <<the types**T10**Articles**None**5**types>> of social networks which I mentioned before. If we talk about <<Facebook**T11**Capitalisation**None**8**facebook>>, the youngest group has <<the biggest**T30**Articles**None**7**biggest>> percentage of people who use it. In <<other**T13**Adjectives**None**6**others>> groups, popularity of <<Facebook**T14**Capitalisation**None**8**facebook>> is lower. However, at least fifty percent of <<each group's members**T15**Absence_explanation**None**11**each groups>> <<use**T16**Agreement_errors**None**4**uses>> it. <<Instagram is less popular compared to Facebook**T20**Cleft**None**47**Instagram, compared to Facebook is less popular>>, especially among <<older**T33**lex_item_choice**None**5**elder>> groups. The reason#DELETE#1#, of such unpopularity#DELETE#1#, is quite simple. <<elderly people**T27**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**Elderies>> don’t like to show their everyday life to the whole world. <<LinkedIn**T25**Spelling**None**8**Linkedin>> isn’t very popular among any group. However, there isn’t <<a big difference**T26**Articles**None**14**big difference>> between <<the percentage**T31**Articles**None**10**percentage>> of respondents<< who use it**T29**Defining**None**13**, who uses it>>, if we compare to <<two other**T27**lex_item_choice**None**10**previsious>> social networks.
