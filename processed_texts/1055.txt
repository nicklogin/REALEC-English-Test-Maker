There are a lot of problem with a public law. One of them is a question about pirates who download and share files with other people in the Internet.

There are a lot of people who use illegal content and they know it but pirates save our money and it is the main reason for them. Furthermore, it is much comfortable to watch new movie at home from the illegal sources than go to the cinema and spend time and money for it.

It is true but we also have musicians and film producers who lose many money. I think it is quite normal when you go to the supermarket and pay money for products. It is the same situation! All of us should understand that songs or films are products too and when you don’t pay for it you are a thief. Furthermore, when you buy music or films it has a good quality, you don’t need to wait when pirates download it to Internet and sometimes producers give some gifts for fair customers. I think that our politicians shall support producers of content and to increase punishment for pirates however it is not always help.

In the age of new technologies it is a very important to fight with pirates. Each content producer lose money which he can spend to new quality film or record of song or album. I totally argree with those who think that such things should be punished. Thief must be in prison.
