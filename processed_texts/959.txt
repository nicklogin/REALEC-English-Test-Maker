Every year the percentage of crimes <<committed**T1**Spelling**None**8**commited>> by young people grows. Compared to previous <<periods,**T4**Punctuation**None**7**periods>> today it has reached <<a level unseen before**T2**Word_order**None**21**unseen before a level>>. Why <<is this happening**T6**Interrogative**None**17**this is happening>> in our <<constantly**T5**lex_item_choice**None**9**instantly>> developing world? And how <<can we deal**T7**Interrogative**None**11**we can deal>> with that problem? This is what this essay is about.
It is obvious, the main cause is careless parents. Nowadays some of them believe that modern technologies (like <<the Internet**T8**Articles**None**8**Internet>>) and teachers in schools can substitute them in explaining to a kid what is good and what is bad. <<However,**T9**Punctuation**None**7**However>> that is not true. Children need <<instant**T10**Spelling**None**6**intant>> guidance in our <<world,**T11**Punctuation**None**5**world>> and if parents think lessons in school are enough, then there will be a lack of knowledge about <<consequences of a crime**T12**Word_order**None**19**crimes consequences>>. The situation becomes even worse when a child <<becomes**T13**Tense_form**None**6**become>> a witness of #DELETE#10#committing a crime at home, i.e. home violence.
It seems, rooms for improvement here are <<rather**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**6**pretty>> clear. First of all, we need to make parents really <<care for**T18**Prepositional_verb**None**10**care about>> their children. This is the only way we can <<fill in**T20**Prepositional_verb**None**4**fill>> the blanks in the <<young people's**T19**Possessive**None**7**youngs’>> understanding the fact that violence and crime are strongly unacceptable. For example, government can <<strengthen**T16**Spelling**None**10**strenghten>> parents’ responsibility for their kid's behaviour by arresting them. <<Secondly**T21**lex_item_choice**None**6**Second>>, teachers in schools can start a course about crimes where would be explained about consequences of <<committing**T22**Spelling**None**9**commiting>> a crime and how to deal with problems in legal ways.
To conclude, I believe the main reason why modern society faces extremely high rates of <<crimes committed by young people**T23**Standard**None**25**the young people's crimes>> compared to other years is <<grown**T25**Voice**None**6**growed>> <<parents**T26**Possessive**None**7**parents>> inability to take care of their children due to technology and school overpricing. To reduce that rate, I would recommend to encourage parents to teach their <<children**T27**Inappropriate_register**None**4**kids>> using government measures and to add a new course about crimes into school learning plan.
