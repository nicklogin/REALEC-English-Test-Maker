<<Nowadays**T3**lex_item_choice**None**5**Today>> in our modern <<world**T2**lex_item_choice**None**7**century>> there are <<a lot of**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**8**lot’s of>> opportunities for leisure. Music and films <<unite**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**related>> many people, however, there are those who convinced that we should not pay for them and those who <<believe**T5**Tense_form**None**11**are believe>> that pirate copies and Internet downloads are illegal. The issue is rather complicated, <<I am**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**3**I’m>> going to express my personal opinion and analyse <<the opposite one**T7**Articles**None**15**by opposite one>>.

First of all, I disagree with those sceptics, who are convinced that music and films <<belong**T9**lex_item_choice**None**11**are beloved>> to musicians and producers, and there should be <<a punishment**T10**Articles**None**10**punishment>> for pirate copies. In my opinion, if a person is gifted, if <<he**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> <<has**T12**Tense_choice**None**3**had>> God’s talent, <<his**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> art (music, films, paintings, poems) <<belongs**T14**lex_item_choice**None**11**is bellowed>> to the whole world, to <<everyone**T15**lex_item_choice**None**10**everything>>. <<He**T16**Inappropriate_register**None**2**He>> should enjoy that <<others**T17**Articles**None**10**the others>> make illegal copies from <<his**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> art and save downloads for free. Because the art is not a business; <<it is**T19**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> <<a way of living**T20**Absence_explanation**None**5**a way>>. However, those<< who are not gifted**T21**Defining**None**20**, who are not gifted>> and make some arts for money also should be glad that their boring arts are useful for someone.

In spite of these arguments, there are musicians and producers and directors who lose their money <<because of**T22**Prepositions**None**4**from>> pirate and Internet copies. They <<invest**T23**Spelling**None**9**investate>> <<their capital and time**T24**Absence_explanation**None**16**capital and time>>, but today less and less people buy disks with favourite <<bands**T26**lex_item_choice**None**5**group>> and <<DVDs**T25**Noun_number**None**3**DVD>> because of <<the Internet**T27**Articles**None**8**Internet>> <<, where**T28**Punctuation**None**5**where>> <<it is possible**T29**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**is possible>> to download everything you want and you do not need even to go out of your flat. People who earn money by art usually want <<to protect**T30**lex_item_choice**None**4**save>> their work not only from pirate copies but also from other people’s changing, copying, #DELETE#9#cospleing. <<No**T32**Spelling**None**2**So>> one author <<wants**T33**Agreement_errors**None**4**want>> <<his**T34**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> work to <<be laught at**T35**Prepositional_verb**None**8**laughing>>.

Maybe there <<are**T36**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> some points in my opponent’s position, but these people do not take into consideration the fact that we live in <<the Internet**T37**Articles**None**8**Internet>> century now, in the big open global world. Everything is bought and sold.

To sum up, I would like to put and emphasis on my opinion again. Copying and sharing music or films is not a crime <<or**T38**Spelling**None**1**o>> theft, people who download these files should not be punished. However, every opinion has its right to <<exist**T39**Category_confusion**None**9**existence>>.
