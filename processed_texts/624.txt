Some people say that <<nowadays**T461**Spelling**None**7**nowdays>> more young people start to <<commit**T462**Spelling**None**7**committ>> crimes than ever <<before**T463**Spelling**None**5**befor>>. It is a bad tendency and people should think what can be done with this increasing <<percentage**T464**Spelling**None**10**persantage>>. In this essay I will <<enumerate**T466**lex_item_choice**None**5**write>> some causes of this <<trend**T467**lex_item_choice**None**11**development>> and <<propose parents and teachers some possible solutions for overcoming them**T469**Standard**None**61**propose solutions for overcoming them to parents and teachers>>.
First of all, many youngsters a<<try**T470**Tense_choice**None**10**are trying>>to show their independency. They start to shout at parents, not to go to schools and so on, because they think that it i<<is**T471**Spelling**None**2**ia>>a<<how a really independent person lives**T473**Absence_explanation**None**33**a right way of independent living>> Moreover, they s<<start**T474**Spelling**None**4**star>>to c<<commit**T475**Spelling**None**7**committ>>some small crimes like p<<pocket**T476**Spelling**None**5**poket>>lifting or shop robbery. I suppose that parents should speak with their children to stop this d<<dramatic**T477**Spelling**None**9**drammatic>>behaviour. They should clearly say what is right and what is wrong to do. Moreover, they c<<should**T504**Modals**None**3**can>>look after children more clearly to prevent some crimes.
Secondly, many yongsters can be influenced by gangsters in films. They watch them and be<<start**T478**lex_item_choice**None**6**become>>o do everything to be similar to the heroes of the crime films of 90<<the 90s**T505**Derivation**None**4**90th>>So, as a result they co<<commit**T479**Spelling**None**7**committ>>ome crimes. Fo<<In order to solve this problem,**T480**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**For solving this>> suppose that parents should show only kind films to ch<<their children**T481**Determiners**None**8**children>>ince the early ages. When the child grows up, they want to watch only films which ha<<make**T508**lex_part_choice**None**4**have>>ome se<<sense**T482**Spelling**None**5**sence>>nd which le<<make**T506**lex_part_choice**None**3**let>>hem th<<think**T507**Tense_choice**None**8**thinking>>fter watching it. It will become their behaviour which was made by parents in ch<<the childhood**T483**Articles**None**9**childhood>>The last but not the least cause of this problem is some bad peers of children who do not have parents or the<<whose**T484**Determiners**None**5**their>>thers are drug or alh<<alcohol**T488**Spelling**None**7**alhogol>>dicted. As a result of the<<communication**T486**Articles**None**17**the communacation>>th the<<friends**T509**Articles**None**11**the friends>>ke that, children become to be like them. They want to be a part of the team of that bad peers, so they do all<<everything**T510**lex_item_choice**None**3**all>>ke the<<them**T511**Pronouns**None**4**they>>urthermore, not only crimes are dangerous for them in this society. They also can start to dri<<drink**T487**Spelling**None**5**dring>>h<<alcohol**T489**Spelling**None**7**alhogol>> to take drugs sin<<from**T512**Prepositions**None**5**since>>e early age of 15 or 16. To overcome and stop this trend, parents and tec<<teachers**T490**Spelling**None**7**techers>>ould speak with children everyday. They should tell them all con<<consequences**T491**Spelling**None**12**concequances>> their bad deeds. Moreover, the<<an important way**T493**Articles**None**22**the important solution>>r preventing the<<communication**T495**Articles**None**17**the communacation>>th bad peers can be the<<moving**T496**Articles**None**10**the moving>> some other town. So, cho<<children**T497**Spelling**None**8**choldren>>ll try to start new<<a new life**T498**Articles**None**8**new life>> new<<a new place**T499**Articles**None**9**new place>>o s<<To sum up,**T500**Punctuation**None**9**To sum up>>ould like to say,<<say that**T501**Punctuation**None**9**say, that>>re are many solutions for overcoming this problem, but first of all, adults should unde<<understand**T502**Spelling**None**10**understant>> main reason why their children have committed the crime.
