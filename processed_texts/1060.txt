The graphics below demonstrate an unemployment situation in the world in 2014 and 2015 years.

The table illustrates the biggest percentage of unemployment in North America (12,5%) and the lowest - in South Asia (3,9%). Surprisingly, the indicators have not changed next year in these countries. Nevertheless, the chart also shows some upward and downward trends. For example, we can see the dramatic fall of unemployment in Middle East and Latin America in 2015. The last country I mentioned improved the indicators on 1%, which is a great result. However, there is another situation in European Union, where an unemployment rate increases on 0,4% in 2015, while in 2014 it was 7,5%. Moreover, I should make an emphasis on the similarity of unemployment indicators (5,8% and 5,9%) in Latin America and worldwide in 2015, I think it is also important.

To sum up, I should say that the percentage of unemployment varies due years and countries but we should do our best in minimizing this indicator in the future.
