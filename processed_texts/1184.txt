The graphs below provide information about maximal and minimal temperatures in Russia, Yakutsk and Brazilia, Rio de Janeiro.

There are a lot of differences between <<the two graphs**T1**Articles**None**10**two graphs>>. The most striking one is that <<the temperature**T2**Articles**None**11**temperature>> in Yakutsk rises slightly from winter to summer (with <<the difference**T3**Articles**None**10**difference>> of temperatures about 5 degrees) and then <<falls**T4**Agreement_errors**None**4**fall>> down again in early autumn. While <<the temperature**T5**Articles**None**11**temperature>> in Rio de Janeiro remains stable with <<small fluctuations**T6**Articles**None**20**a small fluctuations>> from 17 degrees in <<the coldest**T8**Superlative_adj**None**13**the most cold>> year to 30 in the hottest one.  Also, Russian months in winter are the coolest and summer are the hottest, when in Brazil things are completely inversed. 

Nevertheless, some similarities exist. For example, the hottest month in Russia is very close to the same month in Brazil with only 5 or 4 degrees difference (25*C to 30). The most outstanding feature is, however, the fact that the difference between the hottest and the coolest months is completely the same for both Russia and Brazil (about 7 or 10 degrees).
