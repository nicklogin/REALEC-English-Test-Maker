<<It is**T339**Confusion_of_structures**None**8**There is>> no secret that top <<athletes**T381**Inappropriate_register**None**9**sportsmen>> not only have <<training sessions**T340**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**training>> almost every day to achieve <<the highest positions**T358**Articles**None**17**highest positions>> in competitions but also use different types of drugs. Despite the fact that most of them are allowed by <<the world sports community**T372**Articles**None**22**world sports community>> and <<international**T391**Spelling**None**14**Internationals>> sports organizations, some of them <<remain**T342**Agreement_errors**None**7**remains>> illegal, and, unfortunately, this fact sometimes <<does not**T343**Inappropriate_register**None**7**doesn't>> <<stop sportsmen and their coaches from using**T347**Prepositional_verb**None**38**stop athletes and their coaches to use>> <<them**T370**Ref_device**None**2**it>>. <<That is**T346**Inappropriate_register**None**6**That's>> why some people believe that such <<athletes**T383**Inappropriate_register**None**9**sportsmen>> should be disqualified forever. However, others argue that <<a temporary ban**T360**Articles**None**13**temporary ban>> is suitable for such situatons. In this essay both of these points of view will be discussed.
First group of people postulate that <<athletes**T391**Inappropriate_register**None**12**the athletes>> must be banned for a long time, even forever. They explain <<this**T348**Spelling**None**3**his>> by the fact that <<athletes**T385**Inappropriate_register**None**9**sportsmen>> should not use any drugs to achieve goals and trainings is the only one variant. "If <<a person**T350**Articles**None**6**person>> <<cannot**T349**Spelling**None**7**can not>> compete using <<an honest way**T373**Articles**None**10**honest way>>, why <<should we**T359**Interrogative**None**9**we should>> call <<them**T351**Inappropriate_register**None**3**him>> <<sportsman**T354**Punctuation**None**9**"athlete">>?", they claim. Besides, <<if a sportsman was caught once,**T375**Punctuation**None**26**if athlete was caught once>> there is no <<guarantee**T362**lex_item_choice**None**10**confidence>> that this situation will not <<be repeated**T369**Voice**None**6**repeat>>.
Others <<say**T377**lex_item_choice**None**4**tell>> that <<a**T374**Articles**None**3**ban>> for a whole life is too strict <<a measure**T378**Articles**None**7**measure>>. <<Prohibition to do**T363**Noun_inf**None**21**Prohibition for doing>> sports for a couple of years should <<change**T364**Spelling**None**6**charge>> <<athletes**T388**Inappropriate_register**None**11**sportsmen's>> mind, they think. <<Moreover,**T368**Punctuation**None**8**Moreover>> this version says that there are a lot of anti doping systems and organizations<< which**T376**Defining**None**7**, which>> rather correctly manage situation with illegal drugs.
My opinion is close to the second #DELETE#7#variant, because I believe that most of <<athletes**T389**Inappropriate_register**None**9**sportsmen>> who have been caught after using illegal drugs did this for the last time. However, we should be strict in some way to such <<athletes**T390**Inappropriate_register**None**9**sportsmen>> and take away all their awards and trophies which have been <<won**T366**lex_item_choice**None**5**taken>> in <<the "doping" period**T365**Articles**None**15**"doping" period>>.
<<To conclude,**T367**Punctuation**None**11**To conclude>> it should be noted that <<there**T352**Spelling**None**3**the>> are a lot of <<ways**T380**lex_item_choice**None**8**variants>> how to punish <<dishonest**T353**Prefix**None**8**unhonest>> <<athletes**T391**Inappropriate_register**None**9**sportsmen>>, but we should do this using rational approach.
