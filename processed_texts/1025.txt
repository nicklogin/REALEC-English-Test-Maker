Annually, musicians and film producers lose lots of money. It happens because of downloading files on the Internet. It is also believed that copying music and films on the Internet is theft. I absolutely disagree with this belief.

First of all, we should find reasons why do people download music or films. I reckon that the main reason is money. Not everybody has an opportunity to buy a CD disc with music and not everybody has money to go to the cinema to watch a new film. Without any doubts, CD discs and ticket to the cinema does not cost a fortune but there are many poor people who cannot spend money on entertaiment. That is why a lot of music and films are downloaded. Downloading makes music and films avaliable for everyone.

Secondly, if you download something, you save your time. You do not need to go somewhere. You just log on and every song , every film is avaliable to you. It takes about a minute to download a song and about 10 minutes to download a film. Then you can relax and enjoy yourself. People who make music or film producers should understand that their masterpieces will always be downloaded. People get addicted to download. For people there are more advantages in downloading and saving files from the Internet. If film producers or musicians do not agree with it and they are against it, they have to think will everybody spend their money, time and another resoucers on visiting the cinema or buying a disk.

To draw a conclusion I would like to add that this topic has its own pros and cons but I suppose that downloading files is not so bad idea.
