In this <<essay**T268**Spelling**None**5**essey>> I would like to <<analyse**T269**Spelling**None**7**analise>> different effects of the hobby.

Firstly, we can de<<divide**T270**Spelling**None**6**devide>>eople in two groups: active fans and passive ones. The second group usually does sp<<spend**T271**Spelling**None**5**spent>>oo much time whatching sports, they do it al<<almost always**T272**Absence_explanation**None**6**almost>>n TV and don't significantly affect the society, while the first group,usually wathcing live sport events, can be really agressive.
We can rem<<remember**T273**Spelling**None**7**remeber>>ny cases when the<<a booing croud**T274**Articles**None**16**the booing croud>> fans ruined parts of cities and traumatized each other.So-called active fans can be called a problematic part of soc<<the society**T275**Articles**None**7**society>>Nevertheless, there is an op<<the opposite opinion**T278**Articles**None**19**an opposite opinion>><<opinion which**T277**Defining**None**14**opinion, which>>m<<claims**T279**Spelling**None**7**claimes>> fans can be socially-friendly and, what is more important, they help sport industry development,which makes natio<<the nation**T281**Articles**None**6**nation>> healt<<healthy**T280**Spelling**None**6**healty>>s point of view is, whith<<without**T282**Spelling**None**8**whithout>>d<<any**T283**Spelling**None**3**ane>>t, sensible.
Still, we should take into account the fact that being sport <<a sport fan**T284**Articles**None**9**sport fan>>'t mean being fit and healthy. The vast majority of fans dring <<drink**T285**Spelling**None**5**dring>>g<<alcohol**T286**Spelling**None**8**alchogol>>at junk food. So, it can't be called a healthy lifestyle.

To conclude,it can be noticed that watching sports can be useful for the pers<<personal health**T287**Articles**None**19**the personal health>>ional development, only if you don't neglect it.
