It’s a well-known fact that all products from industry like <<music and film production**T2**Absence_comp_sent**None**14**music and film>> are easily <<illegaly**T1**Category_confusion**None**7**illegal>> copied and <<transferred**T3**Spelling**None**10**transfered>> to the different <<websites**T4**Noun_number**None**7**website>> for free download, thus, producers lose <<enormous**T5**Spelling**None**8**enourmes>> amounts of money. Some people consider that it’s not right and it must be punished. <<From my point of view,**T6**Punctuation**None**21**From my point of view>> I can’t but <<agree**T7**Spelling**None**4**agry>> with statements below, however, I have some reasons against them.
<<As we all know,**T9**Punctuation**None**14**As we all know>> that musicians and film producers can have success<< when**T10**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> their <<products**T11**Noun_number**None**7**product>> like songs, <<albums**T12**Lack_par_constr**None**5**album>>, <<films**T13**Lack_par_constr**None**4**film>> or serials <<become**T14**Tense_form**None**6**became>> popular and desirable. Nevertheless, one of their money <<resources**T15**Noun_number**None**8**resource>> is selling it all in public. In contrast, the Internet is a new service<< where**T16**Punctuation**None**7**, where>> people can find all they want and <<absolutely**T17**Spelling**None**9**absolutly>> free. For instance, we can look for all live <<concerts**T18**Noun_number**None**7**concert>> <<of**T19**Prepositions**None**4**from>> famous rock <<stars**T20**Noun_number**None**4**star>> on <<YouTube**T21**Spelling**None**7**youtube>> and download all his <<songs**T22**Noun_number**None**4**song>> free instead of buying his albums in shops. Nobody will deny that a lot of pirate copies of just released films <<appear**T23**Tense_choice**None**8**appeared>> almost after the first cinema shows it. <<To my mind,**T24**Punctuation**None**10**To my mind>> I clearly understand that these actions are horrible for the <<musical**T25**Category_confusion**None**8**musician>> and film <<industries**T26**Noun_number**None**8**industry>>. Also, I know that there are a lot of fans that like to collect all the original discs from their beloved <<artists**T34**lex_item_choice**None**12**interpretors>>. Although, I <<, as the one of these illegal users,**T30**Punctuation**None**33**as the one of these illegal users>> consider that<< when**T31**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> we have the easier way, why do not use it? <<As**T32**Often_confused**None**4**Like>> an average man, who earns not so huge amount of money, I just do<< what**T33**Punctuation**None**6**, what>> is in my possibilities.
To conclude, I disagree with the action of copying and sharing music or films, however, I want not to refuse from this comfortable <<option**T34**Spelling**None**6**opsion>>.
