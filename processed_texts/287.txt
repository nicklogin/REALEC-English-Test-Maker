<<Musicians**T42**Suffix**None**9**Musicunts>>, filmmakers and <<others**T3**Category_confusion**None**5**other>> lose a lot of money every year because of <<pirates**T4**Spelling**None**6**pirets>>. <<Instead of buying a legal copy of any product,**T5**Punctuation**None**45**Instead of buying a legal copy of any product>> <<pirates**T6**Spelling**None**6**pirets>> are spreading it illegally <<on**T7**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet. Why <<do**T8**Tense_choice**None**3**did>> they do that? Probably, we can find a way to share media content <<on**T9**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet without <<stealing**T10**lex_item_choice**None**5**theft>>.
First of all, everybody who download something <<on**T11**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet should be punished, if he <<do**T42**Tense_form**None**4**done>> it without <<permission**T14**lex_item_choice**None**9**acception>> or paying. We should stay at the position that every work shoud be doing for <<a price**T15**Articles**None**5**price>> or any <<immaterial**T16**Prefix**None**10**inmaterial>> goods, like glory, respect or something like that. <<In another case,**T18**Punctuation**None**15**In another case>> the working is not payed. If <<it is so**T19**Abs_comp_clause**None**5**it so>>, media <<makers**T20**Spelling**None**7**maykers>> have no <<resources**T21**Spelling**None**8**resurses>> or no motivation to do something. So <<if we do not pay,**T22**Punctuation**None**16**if we do not pay>> the makers <<do not create**T24**Negation**None**10**not create>>.
The another way to look at this question is to see that <<a person**T25**Articles**None**6**person>> not always can buy the original disc. <<He**T26**Spelling**None**3**The>> can have no way to use <<a disc**T28**Articles**None**4**disc>> <<, for example,**T29**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> on <<modern electronics**T30**Articles**None**20**a modern electronics>> or have no market with the discs near him. <<That's**T27**Spelling**None**5**Thats>> why he have <<to use the Internet and copy something illegally**T32**Lack_par_constr**None**51**to use the Internet and copying something illegally>>. We can <<solve**T33**Spelling**None**4**salw>> this problem with making the special internet portals where people <<could copy or listen, or watch**T34**Verb_Bare_Inf**None**39**could copying or listening, or watching>> media content <<legally**T35**Spelling**None**6**legaly>>. And <<nowadays**T36**Spelling**None**7**nowdays>> there are some examples of <<it**T37**Pronouns**None**4**this>>, like iTunes or Yandex Music. But they are not so comfortable to use as they <<should be**T38**Abs_comp_clause**None**6**should>>.
To conclude, we have the situation when the illegal copying and sharing of the media content is <<widespread**T39**Compound_word**None**10**wildspread>>. Everybody who do this should be punished but <<, at the same time,**T41**Punctuation**None**16**at the same time>> we should find a way to share media with the Internet <<legally**T42**Spelling**None**6**legaly>> and in the more comfortably.
