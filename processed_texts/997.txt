Nowadays the problem of illegal using and sharing media-content is getting more significant all over the world. It is popular opinion that people who illegally download films and music should be punished.

Personally, I quite agree with this statement. 

First of all, it is work of musicians and film producers. Their creativity skills and talent must be paid for. If their fans want to continue watch these movies and music they should give money for it. Getting pirate copies these people waste money.

Secondly, I want to mention that downloading pirate copies of media-content is theft like theft of any material object.

To sum it up, it is important to punish people who download pirate copies nand break the rules because their activity is damage for musicians.
