<<In recent years,**T1**Punctuation**None**15**In recent years>> the problem of illegal drugs in sport has become <<particularly acute**T3**Word_choice**None**10**very acute>>. The fact is, two points of view on this situation <<exist as**T18**Linking_device**None**6**exists>> some people believe that athletes who used illegal drugs should be banned from <<professional**T25**Category_confusion**None**10**profession>> competitions for a limited period (i.e. 2 years). Others are sure that such sportsmen should be banned for the rest of their lives. This essay will <<examine**T7**Category_confusion**None**8**examined>> both points of view <<carefully**T8**Derivation**None**8**carefuly>>.
Personally I believe that athletes <<caught**T10**Spelling**None**6**cought>> using illegal drugs should be punished by banning from competing professionally for no more <<than**T11**Word_choice**None**4**then>> 2 years. Firstly, it is <<obvious**T12**Category_confusion**None**9**obviously>> for me that <<a stricter punishment**T13**Articles**None**19**stricter punishment>> may be too cruel and violent. We cannot prohibit a sportsman to promote the deed of his life. Secondly, I believe that this ban will help to make the person better and this sportsman will not try illegal drugs <<again**T24**Adverbs**None**7**anymore>>.
Anyway, there are a lot of people who do not share this point of view. They <<argue that**T4**Punctuation**None**11**argue, that>> people do not change. The athlete who tried illegal <<drugs**T22**Noun_number**None**4**drug>> one time would <<do it**T23**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**do>> another time. The second vital idea is that such violent punishment as prohibition to compete professionally <<for**T19**Prepositions**None**6**during>> the rest of <<their life**T20**Ref_device**None**8**the life>> will stop other athletes from competing <<unfairly**T21**Category_confusion**None**6**unfair>>. The fact is, one example may show <<what can occur if you**T6**Punctuation**None**23**what can occure, if you>> break the rules.
To conclude, I would like to <<say that**T16**Punctuation**None**9**say, that>> the problem of <<punishing**T5**Spelling**None**8**punichng>> the <<athletes who have been caught**T9**Absence_explanation**None**16**athletes, caught>> using illegal drugs is very actual and acute. In my opinion, such sportsmen should be banned for a limited period, because <<a stricter punishment**T17**Articles**None**19**stricter punishment>> may be too violent and <<does not stop**T18**Agreement_errors**None**11**do not stop>> other athletes from breaking the prohibition.
