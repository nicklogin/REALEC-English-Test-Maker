There is an opinion that using of modern technical devices could cause serious health problems. The number of these problems is increasing. There are some of health diseases and ways of <<their**T1**Ref_device**None**3**its>> reduction.  

The most common problem is a headache. Modern teenagers cannot live without their gadgets. These devices produce blue light from their screens. It causes a high blood pressure because of the long using of devices. This problem may be solved by <<reducing the use**T3**lex_item_choice**None**10**less using>> of any electronic <<device**T2**Noun_number**None**7**devices>> and switching screens to a night shift. The night shift is a regime which makes <<a screen**T4**Articles**None**6**screen>> warmer. It means that colors shift to yellow instead of blue. Also, people believe that electronic devices may cause problems with eyes, heart and cancer. Firstly, there are many researches that <<proved**T5**lex_item_choice**None**6**showed>> the bad effect on eyes because of using modern technologies. This blue light from <<the screens**T6**Articles**None**7**screens>> is not good for people’s eyes. The solution is a pair of glasses and decreasing the number of hours which people spend near their gadgets. Secondly, there is no scientific confirmation about heart <<diseases**T7**Noun_number**None**7**disease>> and cancer which could be caused by modern technologies. Although, scientist try to find <<the correlation**T14**Articles**None**13**interrelation>> between radio waves and human’s body. The only way <<not to have**T10**Word_order**None**11**to not have>> a lot of radio waves near  human’s body is <<not to use**T11**Word_order**None**10**to not use>> electronic devices at all. 

To <<conclude**T13**Category_confusion**None**10**conclusion>>, electronic devices <<affect**T14**Transitive**None**9**affect on>> people. Sometimes they may cause a headache or problems with eyes, but the most common problem is that gadgets consume our time, which we could spend on ourselves and our families.
