For the great majority of people the idea of technological progress seems to be harmful for health. This essay <<argues in support of the idea**T347**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**agrees>> that people <<can suffer**T339**Modals**None**13**can suffering>> from development of high-tech. Firstly, this essay <<discusses**T341**Verb_pattern**None**13**discuss about>> the main problems with health caused by technological progress followed by an analysis of main solutions.
<<It**T342**Ref_device**None**4**This>> is <<no doubt**T348**Absence_comp_colloc**None**11**undoubtedly>> that modern technology has a bad influence on human health. For example, computer lights <<damage**T349**Verb_pattern**None**10**damage for>> eyes. Moreover, a lot of people <<spend a lot of time with TV**T358**Standard**None**27**spend with TV a lot of time>>. <<This**T359**Determiners**None**2**It>> can be a reason for <<hypodynamia**T360**Spelling**None**11**hypodinamia>>. 
Some experts emphasized that microwave is a very bad way to cook <<a meal**T361**Articles**None**8**the meal>> because of dangerous waves that <<cause**T362**Tense_choice**None**6**caused>> serious <<problems**T363**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> with health, for example, cancer. One of the most striking features of this problem <<is that**T350**Abs_comp_clause**None**4**that>> a lot of people <<are aware of**T343**Category_confusion**None**5**aware>> the fact that modern technology <<is**T351**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> known to be dangerous for their health, but continue to use it in the daily routine #DELETE#14#and very often.
What is need to improve the situation is define action. One must admit that people need to reduce the consumption of high-tech products.
For example, to have <<one TV**T344**Determiners**None**8**a one TV>> in the house instead of a four, do not <<spend**T345**Spelling**None**5**spent>> a lot of time with computer games and to sit in the front of TV <<during**T352**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the whole day. From these facts, one may conclude that human demand on new technology is very high, but for healthy living it is needed to reduce the influence of modern techology by <<decreasing**T356**lex_item_choice**None**9**declining>> this percentage in consumption.
One cannot possibly accept that people need to refuse a lot of <<gadgets**T346**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>> and laptops in their life, but according to authority scientific researches it is the reason of suffering from various <<diseases**T354**Spelling**None**8**deseases>>.
From these facts, one may conclude that human need to admit the influence on their health from gadjets and use it less and rarely than <<before.**T356**Punctuation**None**6**before>>
