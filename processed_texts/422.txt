Understandably, there is infinite number of crimes today, which are committed by teenagers. People all over the world try to understand the causes of these actions. In this essay I will suggest the main causes of this problem and possible solutions that can be taken to diminish the number of crimes.
There are loads of people who have problems and they are eager to make fortune and these people find that crimes can help them. Moreover, such behaviour comes from families, because young people are suffered from the lack of attention and they want to show them. What is more, nowadays, TV and the Internet have a great impact on people's lives. There can be seen violence, dire actions, and teens want to repeat these actions in real life.
The first possible solution that can be undertaken is limit the time in front of the Tv and the Internet. Parents should pay more attention to their childern and curb the time, spending in front of computers.Besides, parents spend their free time at the reastaurants with friends, or they go shopping, while young people do not know what to do and they meet new friends on the Internet, who can have an unpleasant impact on adolescents. In thic case, parents should spend more time with their children and then young people understand that they can rely on parents in any situation and difficulties.
The second solution is to increase phycical exercises and talk with the psychologist if they have some problems. It will help them to boost the motivation and , of course, the professionals can explain them to overcome hurdles. What is more, teachers should show their students that there are many ways to tackle problems and
To sum everything up I firmly believe that both teachers and parents are responsible for the behaviours of young people and they should undertake actions in order to solve the problem with crimes decrease the number of committments.
