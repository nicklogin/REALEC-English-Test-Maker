The bar chart below shows how much time was spent on sport and <<exercising**T1**Category_confusion**None**8**exercise>> by men and women <<depending**T2**Category_confusion**None**13**in dependence>> on their age in England in <<2012.**T3**Punctuation**None**4**2012>>
Looking at the graph, it can be seen that y<<younger**T4**Spelling**None**6**yonger>>people do s<<sports**T259**Noun_number**None**5**sport>>much more than elderly ones which is quite obvious thing. The quantity of s<<fit**T5**lex_item_choice**None**8**sportish>>English people d<<decreased**T261**Tense_choice**None**9**decreases>>constantly from the 16-24-years-old i<<interviewees**T6**Spelling**None**12**interwiewers>>i#DELETE#12#n age 16-24 to people over 75 years. So the y<<youngest**T7**Spelling**None**7**yongest>>part of the male i<<interviewees**T8**Spelling**None**12**interwiewers>>spent 282,1 minutes on exercise and sport and the female part of them s<<spent 114,1 minutes on these activities**T268**Absence_explanation**None**19**spent 114,1 minutes>> whereas the oldest men could do it just for 29,2 mintues and oldest women just for 1<<10**T270**Numerals**None**2**1o>>minutes.

Moreover, the bar chart demonstrates that in <<regardless**T274**Word_choice**None**8**in spite>> the age male sport was<<was more popular than female one in 2012**T272**Standard**None**40**was in 2012 more popular than female one>>owever, the difference between figures showing the quantity of the young male sportsmen and the old ones is considerably less than the difference between a p<<the peak**T276**Articles**None**6**a peak>>d a l<<the trough**T277**Articles**None**8**a trough>> women's sport activities. What is interesting, in <<at**T280**Prepositions**None**2**in>>e<<the age**T282**Articles**None**3**age>> 55-64 years women did spo<<sports**T283**Noun_number**None**5**sport>>ightly more than men (the figures are 52,7 minutes for men and 55,4 for women).

Overall, almost in an<<at**T285**Prepositions**None**2**in>>age English men in 20<<were more active in sport in 2012**T287**Standard**None**33**in 2012 were more active in sport>> this difference goes down with a course of time.
