Nowadays, there is a growing tendency to copy and share some types of electronic information illegally. It is mostly connected with the increasing importance of the Internet for people. In my opinion, punishing people for <<committing such crimes**T1**lex_item_choice**None**17**doing such crimes>> should be <<stopped**T2**lex_item_choice**None**9**cancelled>>#DELETE#1#, because of the <<content**T24**Spelling**None**7**context>> of <<the new market**T4**Articles**None**10**new market>>, which changes under the pressure <<because of**T41**Prepositions**None**2**of>> the Internet.
First of all, it is important to understand that <<noone can**T28**Negation**None**10**you cannot>> control <<all**T29**Prepositions**None**6**all of>> the information in <<the Web**T5**Redundant**None**16**the Web networks>>. There are many people<< who**T6**Defining**None**5**, who>> copy and share content of electronic information illegally, but catching and punishing <<them all**T30**Ref_device**None**11**all of them>> will be really expensive. The cost of this <<may probably be**T7**Standard**None**15**may be probably>> higher than the loss of money from #DELETE#14#the process of <<pirating**T32**Punctuation**None**10**“pirating”>>.
Secondly, modern market moves in the direction of micro transactions, instead of <<simply**T8**Category_confusion**None**6**simple>> selling the product. You can get more money from <<a consumer**T9**Articles**None**8**consumer>><< who**T33**Punctuation**None**5**, who>> has free access to some fragments of your film, but pays for the other fragments. However, this strategy can also be <<disrupted**T34**lex_item_choice**None**8**violated>> by pirates, because they can make copies of expensive fragments. Besides, statistics shows that this method of fighting with pirates is more effective than punishing them.
Last but not least, punishing pirates leads to the violation of the <<right to**T10**Prepositions**None**9**right for>> <<freedom**T11**Articles**None**11**the freedom>> in the Internet. By monitoring and controlling cases of illegal copying of <<information**T12**Articles**None**15**the information>>, companies will <<invade**T13**lex_item_choice**None**9**interrupt>> private life of people and <<deprive them of the opportunity**T14**Absence_comp_sent**None**17**their opportunity>> to be free in the web.
Taking everything into consideration, my disagreement with the <<punishment**T16**Category_confusion**None**9**punishing>> of <<people**T17**Articles**None**10**the people>><< who copy and share music or films illegally**T18**Defining**None**54**, who have copied and shared music or films illegally,>> can be explained by the influence of the Internet on the modern market system. <<Law**T37**Capitalisation**None**3**law>> should be appropriate <<for**T21**Prepositions**None**2**to>> the instantly changing reality and <<should deal**T38**Agreement_errors**None**4**deal>> with pirates as with <<a common element**T22**Articles**None**18**the common element>> of modern world.
