Some people say that i ncreasing use of moder n technology is effecting on. health problems. In this essay I will disscus some of those problems, and will try to find a solution to reduce the harm out of these problems.
To begin with, there are several main problems which are caused by computers, tv's and so on. First, and the main for me, is brainwork. While using our smartphones people are affected by radioactive impulses wich destroy our brain system, and eaven could lead to canser.
However, there is a solution out of this problem and it is special phone case which reduse the harm from radioactive waves.
However, there is another problem caused by small screen's and Low quality picture in our smart phones. All of those cause problems with eyes. People could easily become blind by using a small screen phone. Nevertheless, this problem will be soon resolved by creating a special screen with high quality.
In conclusion I would Like to say that there are a lot of problems which are caused by modern technology. but all theese problems could be reduced. by using other modern technologies. =)
