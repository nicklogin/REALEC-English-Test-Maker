As we know, nowadays using of illegal drugs is a real big problem in sport all over the world. There are a lot of people who clime that athlete's ban should be more strongly (for hole life of athlet). While another people consider that athletes should be banned only for 2 years. In this essay I would like to discuss these points of view and give my own opinion.
Firstly, I want to start by saying that in contemporary world hire sport cannot be without medical suggest. We know that athletes has a lot of risk in their job. Sport is draconian travmatic. Thats why athlets very often need to medical help. And sometimes medicaments that were possible and legal, became illegal drugs. For example, such situation with russian athletes before Summer Olimpic Games in 2016. Mildronat suddenly became an illegal drug. As we can remember, huge number of Russian athletes became banned. I think that this example illustrates that sometimes athletes use illegal drugs not spesially. There is no doubt that in this situation sportsmen cannot be banned for the rest of their lives.
However, we know a lot of examples of spesial using illegal drugs. Sportsmen do it, because they want to become stronger. It is not honestly for enother athletes, because they think that they compite with clean sportsmen. These arguments provide people, who clime that athletes, who use illegal drugs, must be banned from competitions for hole lives. Another point, that they admire, is that illegal drugs are very dangerous for sportsmen health.
In my opinion, I strongly believe that such situation is different and individuality. One athlete should be banned for all life, another for 2 years. It depends on situation.
To sum up, I can say that nowadays there are a lot of illegal drugs in sport and sports federations or antidoping federations should solve this problem honestly.
