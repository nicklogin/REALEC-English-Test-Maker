It is considered that the increasing number of health problems <<depends**T1**Voice**None**11**is depended>> on the widespread use of modern technology. People think that the development of some modern features is very harmful <<for**T2**Prepositions**None**2**to>> the population <<, and**T3**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<it**T4**Ref_device**None**4**this>> is a serious problem which requires <<a qualified solution**T5**Articles**None**18**qualified solution>>. 

This statement cannot be agreed because of several reasons. Firstly, there used to be some lethal health problems such as cancer, which had a 99% of lethal <<outcome**T6**lex_item_choice**None**3**way>> for every person. The unstoppable technical progress has opened some new ways to stop the development of cancer, such as some nuclear therapy and there were even some groups of patients who got a remission after it. Secondly, the widespread use of modern technologies <<allows us**T7**Transitive**None**9**can allow>> to make some resources to cure illnesses cheaper for <<municipal**T8**Spelling**None**8**unicipal>> government in all countries. Furthermore, modern technologies can reveal some health problems faster than even the most qualified doctors and provide comfortable process of curing illnesses. 

Others might say that modern health problems adopt to some cure and develop itself every day.  The spread use of modern technology requires enormous <<amounts**T9**Noun_number**None**6**amount>> of money to reveal new ways to cure such <<health**T10**Category_confusion**None**7**healthy>> problems. This statement cannot be right because the utility of the widespread use of technology, which develop some new ways to cure illnesses, is bigger than the problem of spending money. 

To conclude, the widespread use of modern technology can be expensive to develop <<, but**T11**Punctuation**None**3**but>> the results of the development can reduce health problems faster than the most qualified doctors in the world.
