In <<the century**T1**Articles**None**7**century>> of high technologies it has become <<extremely**T2**Spelling**None**9**extreamly>> popular to rob the music’s or film’s rights owners in the Global net, because of its simplicity, by making their content free for consumers. And due to this problem some people think that those ones who share such content must face the law. As for me, I partly agree with introducing punishments <<to**T3**Prepositions**None**3**for>> them due to <<the next reasons**T4**Articles**None**12**next reasons>>.
First of all, there is no doubt that it is absolutely illegal, because those moves lead to great losses <<for**T5**Prepositions**None**2**of>> musicians and film producers. Almost all of the people would prefer to just download free content instead of paying for it<< if there is one**T6**Punctuation**None**17**, if there is one>>. For instance, most of my groupmates wait for the pirate copies of the films and do not pay in cinema for tickets. In that case <<punishment**T7**Spelling**None**11**panishement>> will <<definitely**T8**Spelling**None**9**defenetly>> motivate them to stop making illegal <<actions**T9**lex_item_choice**None**5**moves>> and start paying for content.
Moreover, in copied content there can be <<mispresented**T23**lex_item_choice**None**12**misreprented>> information, for example, not official translations or cut scenes, so the overviews will be <<negative**T12**lex_item_choice**None**3**low>> and will not show the real picture of the film. May be because of that film <<producers**T13**Spelling**None**8**produers>> will not be sponsored in the future anymore. This problem was common for Russia at the very beginning of the century, when people did not have enough money to buy films or music and they just got pirate translated content which was absolutely incorrect like “Goblin’s” one.
On the other hand, there are still a lot of people in any country who can not afford to pay for it, but they support <<rights**T14**Noun_attribute**None**7**right’s>> owners by sharing it with friends<< who may have money and desire to buy it**T15**Defining**None**41**, who may have money and desire to buy it>>. For instance, my friend last year recommended me <<a film**T16**Articles**None**4**film>> called “<<The**T17**Capitalisation**None**3**the>> <<Hateful**T23**Capitalisation**None**8**hatefull>> <<Eight**T19**Capitalisation**None**5**eight>>” after watching it illegally online. But thanks to that I <<watched**T21**Spelling**None**6**wathed>> it in cinema even 2 times, because of it <<greatness**T22**Spelling**None**9**grateness>>.
Overall, there are pros and cons of 100% punishment for “pirates”, but it really depends on the area<< where they live**T23**Punctuation**None**17**, where they live>>, whether it poor or rich one.
