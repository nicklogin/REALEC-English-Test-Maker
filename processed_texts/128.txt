<<In Yakutsk,**T3**Punctuation**None**10**In Yakutsk>> <<the average**T2**Articles**None**7**average>> temperature changes <<dramatically**T4**lex_item_choice**None**8**strongly>> during <<the year**T1**Articles**None**4**year>>. #DELETE#13#Starting from <<It grows from min -42 in January**T7**Standard**None**32**in January it grows from min -42>> <<to**T5**Prepositions**None**4**till>> max +25 in July. +25 is the highest average temperature in Yakutsk. Then <<the temperature**T9**Articles**None**11**temperature>> falls from +25 to -40 in December. We can see that the lowest temperature is <<achieved**T10**Spelling**None**8**acheived>> in January (-42). Therefore, the diagram of <<the average**T36**Articles**None**7**average>> temperature in Yakutsk is n-shaped and we can see an ascent from January to July and then we can see a descent. The <<amplitude**T11**Capitalisation**None**9**Amplitude>> is big and it is approximately 25-(-42)=67 degrees.
<<In Rio,**T12**Punctuation**None**6**In Rio>> the amplitude is much smaller. The highest possible temperature is <<achieved**T13**Spelling**None**8**acheived>> in January (+30) and the <<lowest**T14**Spelling**None**6**louest>> <<in July**T15**Prepositions**None**7**at July>> (18). Therefore, the <<amplitude**T16**Capitalisation**None**9**Amplitude>> for Rio is 30-18=12 degrees <<, which**T18**Punctuation**None**7**– which>> is 6.5 times lower than in Yakutsk. Moreover, we can see that the shapes of <<the diagrams**T19**Articles**None**8**diagrams>> are different. <<In Rio,**T20**Punctuation**None**6**In Rio>> <<the average**T21**Articles**None**7**average>> temperature <<declines**T22**Spelling**None**8**dedlines>> <<from January to July**T23**Prepositions**None**22**from January till July>>, so it is u-shaped<< while in Yakutsk, it is vice versa**T38**Confusion_of_structures**None**32**, what is vice versa in Yakutsk.>>
Such a big difference in amplitude of diagrams can be explained by different climate types. Yakutsk is placed in <<a harsh continental climate zone**T26**Articles**None**34**the harsh continental climate zone>> <<, while**T25**Punctuation**None**5**while>> Rio is in <<a tropical one**T27**Articles**None**16**the tropical one>>. Rio is <<in**T28**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the <<Southern**T30**Category_confusion**None**5**South>> <<hemisphere**T29**Prefix**None**10**semisphere>> of Earth <<, while**T33**Punctuation**None**5**while>> Yakutsk is on the <<Northern**T40**Category_confusion**None**5**worth>> one. It explains why <<the shapes of the curves are**T35**Agreement_errors**None**27**the shape of the curves are>> different: Yakutsk’s winter <<lasts**T39**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> from December till January while <<Rio's lasts from**T41**Absence_comp_sent**None**14**Rio's one from>> June till August.
