It is widely argued that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats and should aim to import as little as possible. And while people usually bring up damage to #DELETE#9#importing <<a country's economy**T2**Articles**None**17**country’s economy>> as <<the main reason**T3**Articles**None**13**a main reason>> to why they think that way, I strongly disagree with that idea <<with**T4**Prepositions**None**3**for>> a number of reasons listed below.

<<First of all**T5**Absence_explanation**None**9**First off>>, in order to stay healthy people need vitamins and other nutrition elements. Those elements can be found in different kinds of food from all over the world. Obviously, no country in the world can produce all of the world’s variety of food within its borders, so to compensate #DELETE#3#for that <<this**T7**Ref_device**None**4**said>> country <<needs**T8**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> to rely on import. That alone is a reason for importing food, but <<, to insist on my point,**T10**Punctuation**None**21**to insist on my point>> I think it should be noted that the wider choice people have, the better it is for the country’s economy.

Secondly, importing food can be beneficial for <<a country's economy**T11**Articles**None**17**country’s economy>> in the ways that might not be obvious <<. For**T12**Punctuation**None**3**For>> example, if a country is producing too much of a certain <<type**T13**lex_item_choice**None**7**article>> of food, it can export the overhead and #DELETE#7#as such compensate  for the possible economical damage of importing other <<kinds of**T16**Prepositions**None**5**kinds>> food required for the healthy diet of an average citizen, <<otherwise**T17**Confusion_of_structures**None**33**whereas if not for importing food>> the economy would stagnate pretty <<quickly**T18**Category_confusion**None**5**quick>>. 

To sum up, I think <<import**T19**Category_confusion**None**9**importing>> is not necessarily a bad thing, because <<the dicersity**T20**Articles**None**9**diversity>> in food is beneficial for the population’s health and also <<import**T21**Category_confusion**None**9**importing>> allows <<to export**T22**Infinitive_constr**None**13**for exporting>> overheads and not worrying about starving <<population**T23**Articles**None**14**the population>>.
