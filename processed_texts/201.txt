Nowadays, in our modern world technologies make out lives easier. However, such people as musicians and film producers can ever suffer from them, because they help some people to spread their material illegally. Some people think that it is a big issue, whereas others do not. In my essay I will give arguments for and against piracy followed by a reasoned conclusion.
Someone thinks that piracy cannot be tolerated in some cases. First of all, money from the productâ€™s sales can be important source of gained profit for its creator. So, when people download or copy his product, a creator loses a lot of money which he gained with his own efforts. Moreover, this situation can make creators unintersted in making new projects in future, because it decreases their motivation and spur.
However, there are people, who accept the situation with illegal pirate copies. To begin with, these products can be overpriced in some countries and consumers cannot simply afford it. It is especially related to computer software. What is more, nowadays people do not want to pay for things that are not worth it. However, in case with such products as films or music, consumers cannot tell whether it is good or bad until they listen to music or watch that film.
As for me, I suppose that in the future we cannot escape the piracy, because it is uncontrolable process and governments can do nothing with it. <<Nevertheless,**T3**Punctuation**None**12**Nevertheless>> producers may continue to gain profits if their products are worth it, because consumers that have enjoyed a product even in illegal way can praise the producer with money after all.
To sum up, I would like to say that people should be taught about consumers culture at schools, universities and other <<places**T1**Spelling**None**6**peaces>>, because it seem to be the only one way to praise producers under <<these**T2**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> circumstances.
