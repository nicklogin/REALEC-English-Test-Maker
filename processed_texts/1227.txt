A lot of people think that countries <<should produce**T1**Modals**None**17**should to produce>> <<food**T2**Articles**None**8**the food>> for their population and <<do not**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> import <<, only**T4**Punctuation**None**4**only>> <<as little**T5**Prepositions**None**6**little>> #DELETE#4#part as possible. There are many <<arguments**T7**lex_item_choice**None**5**minds>> for this <<view**T8**Spelling**None**4**vies>>. 

First of all, this method strategy government is impact to independent their people. In this situation government should set agrucalturing and other manufactures on own territory. And if this country is not <<strong**T37**lex_item_choice**None**8**strength>> in this way, people should give a lot of resourses. <<Also,**T32**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> this method <<helps to**T33**lex_item_choice**None**10**get chance>> save <<a lot of**T34**lex_item_choice**None**4**many>> money and <<lives**T35**Spelling**None**5**lifes>> of <<this country's**T36**lex_item_choice**None**3**own>> population. And people can work <<on**T29**Prepositions**None**2**in>> ‘food’ manufactures, in this situation Government <<should support**T30**Modals**None**7**support>> opening #DELETE#2#of free job places. 

But from <<the other side**T19**Articles**None**10**other side>>, people of this country <<would not use**T20**Conditionals**None**13**will not used>> all kinds of <<manufactured goods**T21**Absence_comp_colloc**None**13**manufacturing>>, for example, if they are not <<good enough**T22**Comparative_adj**None**8**the best>> <<in that**T23**lex_item_choice**None**11**of this way>>, Government will spend a lot of <<resources**T24**Spelling**None**8**resurses>> <<to improve**T25**Prepositions**None**10**on improve>> manufacturing, and in some <<situations**T26**Noun_number**None**9**situation>> #DELETE#2#of some countries should do <<it**T28**Spelling**None**2**in>> other way. At the same time, there <<is**T17**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> <<a globalization**T18**Articles**None**13**globalization>> in our world. And a lot of countries <<need imported food**T10**Standard**None**16**import need food>>, but they <<use**T11**lex_item_choice**None**11**get realise>> <<other**T12**Often_confused**None**7**another>> instruments <<to provide**T13**Prepositions**None**11**for provide>> <<a good life**T14**Articles**None**9**good life>> <<for**T16**Prepositions**None**2**of>> their people. 

<<Finaly**T9**Spelling**None**6**Finely>>, I disagree with this statement.
