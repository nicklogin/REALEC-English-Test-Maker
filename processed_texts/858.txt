In this essay I will point out some reasons of it and suggest solutions <<to this problem**T309**Redundant_comp**None**23**to resolve this problem>>.
Firstly, the reason of y<<the young committing crimes**T310**Absence_explanation**None**11**youth crime>>may be the media. A lot of violence is shown on TV: there are a lot of movies where criminals are shown as heroes. Teens are vulnerable, they look at this and try to imitate this. So, the media just put them on the wrong path this way.
The solution to this problem is simple. First of all, parents should take control of what their child watches. They should not allow their children to watch too much television during the day and try to organize their free time, <<.**T311**Redundant_comp**None**13**, so that the>>econdly, the reason of inc<<the increase in the rate**T316**Absence_explanation**None**10**increasing>> you<<crimes committed by young people**T312**Absence_explanation**None**11**youth crime>>y be the hig<<high level of**T317**Absence_explanation**None**4**high>>nsumption of drugs and alcohol bet<<among**T313**Prepositions**None**7**between>>e<<youngsters**T318**Articles**None**14**the youngsters>>his makes the psychic of a young person unreasonable and they eas<<can easily**T319**Standard**None**10**easily can>>mmit a crime or do other bad things.
First of all, again parents must protect their child from this by controlling his behavior. Also teachers at school may try to influence their pupils by making special meetings, debates.
To sum up, unfortunately, crime<<crimes**T320**Noun_number**Dependent_change**5**crime>>itted by young people is a <<are**T321**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>>mmon problem of 21st <<the 21st century**T322**Articles**None**12**21st century>>re are several reasons for it, and some actions should be taken to preserve it. Parents and teachers are mostly in favor of influencing young people as they spend a lot of time with them and they have enough experience to help young people choose the right way and not to ruin their life by becoming a criminal.
