Nowadays there is a huge problem being reported by the police the amount of crimes has increased and now it is biggest there ever was. I will try to explain why this happened and how parents and teachers can solve this problem.
First of all, i think the main problem is that young people have a lot of free time and instead of doing something useful they commit crimes, i think that happens because there is nothing to do in their cities and they tend to spend more time on the streets, which can be bad for them. Also, i thinks there are people who already criminals may be even their peers and they hang out together and their influence can easily lead to new crimes being done and even more criminals appearing on the streets.
Nevertheless, there are a couple of ways i can think of how this problem can be solved by teachers and parents. For example, teachers should make their subjects interesting for students so they would spend more time studying instead of just walking round the streets. What is more, teachers could start some extra classes like football by coach, or advanced chemistry by chemistry teacher that would fill all that time which is usually spend on the streets. Talking about parents i thinks they must pay more attention to their kids activities and who are their friends. That would reduce influence of those who are bad man. They can check who is in their kid's friend list in social networks in what activities they are involved because nowadays internet makes it really easy to control everyone.
All in all, I think this problem can be solved just by those who are spending a lot time with young people their professors and parents without police being involved.
