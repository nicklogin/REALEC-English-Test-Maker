For what amount of time it is truly important to ban athletes caught using illegal drugs, from professional competitions?
Some people consider that the distraction for 2 full years is enough. At first, the athlete would understand the weight of responsibility over his shoulder. The second main point of these people's view is that all of the illegal drugs will move out from person's body after two-years period.
However a lot of people are sured that the whole situation isn't so simple. Firstly, some drugs are so effective that they could change the whole blood structure, for example. And it is something that couldn't just go away after some years. Another important point is that the agreement of a sportsman for using drugs illegally. means that this person has no respect for the whole industry, and it's important to ban such people from competition for the rest of their lives
In my opinion, sportsmen caught using illegal drugs shouldn't take part in any other professional competition at all, because it's highly important to protect other athletes from their possible cheating. Because if a person went against the rules one time, he could do it again.
To sum up, nowadays athletes caught using illegal drugs are banned from professional competitions for only 2 years, but it is possible that the ruler will changes and such people wouldn't take part in them at all.
