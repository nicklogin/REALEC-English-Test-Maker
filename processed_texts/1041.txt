The Internet allows us to download films and music for free instead of paying for them. Some people agree that piracy should be punished and others should pay for this content or to be punished for download. This essay argues with this statement.

First of all, prices for the original discs often are too high to buy them. Most of people all other the world are poor and cannot afford to buy every song of film they want. That is why they cannot improve their skills at something but some films can help. Secondly, the websites have money for watching and download the content that people are interested in. If people will pay for everything, they will not often buy songs and films because of the lack of finances. Musicians and film producers will lose more money than before.

Nevertheless, a lot of people agree that everything connecting with piracy should be punished. Such people prefer to buy films and songs because of good quality of information. They have enough money to pay for it and likely good salaries. Among these people are producers and musicians because they lose their money but want to get more benefits for their work. People who collect something also prefer original discs to pirate copies.

To sum up, I completely disagree that people, who download music and films on the internet for free, should be punished for this. Most of the world population are poor and cannot buy this content. Of course, producers lose money but they can use piracy for good purposes. For example, they can make a website with their products and they will take more money for their followers. Moreover, free download is a good stage for rising popularity. And popularity brings money.
