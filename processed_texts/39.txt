<<In fact,**T1**Punctuation**None**7**In fact>> pirate copies led to <<losses of benefits of different producers**T5**Standard**None**44**different producers losseslosses of benefits>> every year. That is why a lot of people think that <<downloading music or films**T7**Transitive**None**29**downloading of music or films>> without paying money for <<those products**T9**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**13**that products>> should be punished. There are some advantages and disadvantages of this point of view.
First and foremost, people spend a lot of money, #DELETE#9#huge sums to <<make**T12**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> a new film or music composition <<, and**T13**Punctuation**None**3**and>> it is <<unfair**T14**Spelling**None**7**unfaire>> <<that**T15**lex_item_choice**None**4**when>> they are not able to get their money. Internet <<websites**T16**lex_item_choice**None**8**survesis>> <<make it possible**T17**lex_item_choice**None**10**get access>> to <<copy and share somebody’s production**T19**Transitive**None**39**copy and share of somebody’s production>>. Perhaps, <<these types**T20**Standard**None**10**this types>> of sites <<should be blocked**T21**Tense_choice**None**15**should be block>><< -**T22**Punctuation**Dependent_change**1**.>> <<and**T23**Capitalisation**Dependent_change**3**And>> then authors’ rights <<will not be broken**T24**Voice**None**14**will not break>>.
Moreover, <<actors**T25**Spelling**None**7**arctors>>, producers, musicians, directors and other people who work in this industry should get <<their salaries**T26**Noun_number**None**12**their salary>> for their job. Sometimes people do understand that <<producing films**T28**Transitive**None**18**producing of films>> is very expensive. Legal copies let to get a compensation.
That is why people who find and download files just <<steal**T29**Spelling**None**4**stil>> them. And it is a type of crime. People who <<commit**T30**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> <<crimes**T31**Noun_number**None**5**crime>> should be punished. Different <<punishments**T61**Noun_number**None**10**punishment>> led to increase of <<sells of the original product**T63**Prepositional_noun**None**26**sells the original product>> (files, discs).
<<However,**T32**Punctuation**None**7**However>> there is another point of view. <<People**T33**lex_item_choice**None**7**Persons>> who download pirate copies are not <<murderers**T34**Spelling**None**6**muders>>. They just try to <<spread**T36**lex_item_choice**None**5**share>> #DELETE#11#with people <<movies**T37**Spelling**None**5**moves>> and beautiful music <<compositions**T38**Spelling**None**12**compusitions>>. Of course, some people feel like spending money <<on**T41**Prepositions**None**3**for>> #DELETE#6#buying <<legal copies**T39**Articles**None**16**the legal copies>> <<which is not productive**T40**Absence_comp_sent**None**17**is not productive>> <<, and**T43**Punctuation**None**3**and>> it can be too costy <<to spend money**T44**Infinitive_constr**None**11**spend money>> <<on**T45**Prepositions**None**2**to>> every film or <<music disk**T46**Noun_attribute**None**13**disc of music>>. They do not care about people who make <<these products**T48**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**13**this products>>. In their <<opinion**T49**Spelling**None**8**oppinion>>, copying and sharing music or films on the Internet <<helps them to save money**T51**Transitive**None**21**helps them save money>>.
To sum up, <<punishment**T52**Spelling**None**10**punishmend>> for <<making and spreading pirate copies**T53**Absence_explanation**None**13**pirate copies>> should be <<stated**T54**Category_confusion**None**12**in the state>> to <<protect**T55**lex_item_choice**None**7**provide>> authors’ rights, but <<, in my opinion,**T58**Punctuation**None**13**in my opinion>> <<it**T57**Agreement_errors**None**4**they>> should not be very strict. Maybe <<fines**T59**lex_item_choice**None**7**shtrafs>> will be #DELETE#4#very suitable. <<can help producers to get their benefits**T65**Transitive**None**51**This solution can help producers get their benefits>> and will be useful for <<governments**T69**Noun_number**None**9**goverment>> and <<economics**T69**lex_item_choice**None**32**economics of different countries>>.
