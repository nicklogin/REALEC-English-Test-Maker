Nowadays it is popularly believed that the problem of illegal drugs in sport has been developing. Lets us to consider two points of view that the punishment must be for a limited period or for the rest of sportsmen lives.
The main argument of the second view is that the cruelty of this measure contributes to stop any drug actions in sport. However, other people claim that it will not help and drug market will developes any way and sportsmen will try to avoid the punishments. Personally I agree with the stronger punishment because it promotes a fall in drug's market and will finally disappear.
Moreover, people think that sportsmen must be banned for a limited period because all people make mistakes and they can change. Nevertheless, the second group says that it not professional. In my opinion, limited period is more humanly, and it is great, however, I am in favour that this problem must be soluted at once.
In addition, people for limited punishment think that only one mistake would be a reason to inability to develope of sport sphere because lots of talented sportsmen could not take part in competitions. Nevertheless, people for strong punishment think that sport sphere will develope more efficently and without any troubles. I strongly agree with it!
In conclusion, as much as the limited period as a punishment may sound in humanism tradition only the conjunction of strong measures could help to tackle this problem.
