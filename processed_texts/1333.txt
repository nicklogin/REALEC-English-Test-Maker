The technological progress nowadays <<influences**T1**Agreement_errors**None**9**influence>> our life more and more every day. It certainly makes our lives easier and we have more free time to do what we want. Unfortunately, this issue has two <<sides:**T2**Spelling**None**6**sidesL>> there are some positive and negative consequences, and these negative aspects may impact on our health.

The most obvious problem that can be <<observed**T3**lex_item_choice**None**4**view>> <<among**T4**Spelling**None**6**amound>> <<people**T5**Articles**None**10**the people>> is <<obesity**T6**Spelling**None**9**obeseness>>. The modern lifestyle <<allow**T7**Spelling**None**6**allowa>> people to sit at home and work, order food, play games, etc, everything is available #DELETE#7#to stay at one place. <<So,**T9**Punctuation**None**2**So>> this passive <<lifestyle**T10**lex_item_choice**None**4**live>> leads to the absence of activity and a person just starts to put on weight. Also it happens because people are too busy and they prefer junk food <<,which is coocked much faster,**T11**Non_defining**None**28**which is coocked much faster>> instead of healthy food. American citizens are famous for this kind of lifestyle <<, and**T14**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<, statistically,**T13**Punctuation**None**13**statistically>> it is the country with the highest rate of people with <<obesity**T15**Spelling**None**9**obeseness>>.

The other health problem is bad eyesight. We spend <<a lot of**T16**lex_item_choice**None**4**over>> time working, entertaining and chatting on the computer, smartphones and other modern gadgets. It is logical that our eyes have a great stress daily <<for**T17**Prepositions**None**6**during>> many hours. People do not miss the opportunity to chat with friends, watch videos even when they eat or do sports. It looks like a <<real**T18**Spelling**None**5**reale>> <<addiction**T19**Spelling**None**9**adication>>.
