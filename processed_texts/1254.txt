The pie charts compare the amounts of goods transported among Eastern European countries in 2008 by rail and by road. Overall, the most noticeable features of both charts are that the <<proportions**T1**Noun_number**None**10**proportion>> of transported metals, machinery and food products significantly <<differ**T2**Agreement_errors**None**7**differs>> <<according to**T3**lex_item_choice**None**12**depanding on>> the kind of transport it was delivered #DELETE#4#with while the <<percentages**T5**Noun_number**Dependent_change**10**percentage>> of manufactured products, chemicals and non-metallic minerals <<show**T20**lex_item_choice**None**5**stays>> #DELETE#23#relatively in and about the same figures. 

<<As it can be seen from the pie chart,**T9**Punctuation**None**36**As it can be seen from the pie chart>> the proportion of <<metals**T11**Noun_number**None**5**metal>> among the goods delivered by rail was about 35% in 2008. In contrast, the percentage of <<metals**T12**Noun_number**None**5**metal>> transported by road commanded the share of only 11%, the major decrease <<is**T13**lex_item_choice**None**2**by>> 24%. The same <<situation**T14**Noun_number**None**10**situations>> concerns the food products and machinery, the difference between two charts was about 19% and 10% respectively.

However, the percentage of manufactured goods delivered  between European countries <<does not**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**7**doesnâ€™t>> depend on the kind of <<transport**T16**Articles**None**13**the transport>>, the <<proportions**T17**Noun_number**Dependent_change**10**proportion>>  of manufactured goods transported by rail and road <<were**T18**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**was>> about the third part of the whole delivered <<goods**T19**Noun_number**None**4**good>>.
