These pie charts provide data about the ways <<different types of goods**T222**Determiners**None**18**the types of goods>> were <<transported**T223**Suffix**None**13**transportated>> in <<Eastern**T224**lex_item_choice**None**7**Western>> Europe in 2008 and <<their respective corresponding percentages.**T225**Absence_explanation**None**19**in which percentage>>.
The largest part of goods <<transported**T226**Suffix**None**13**transportated>> by trains was occupied by metals - their share was 35 percent. Manufactured goods volumed the second biggest result - 25%. Others types of goods shared approximately an equal proportion - 11 or 12 percent. <<Non-metallic**T227**Suffix**None**15**Non-metallistic>> minerals played the least important role in railway transportations.
Comparing the given information <<makes**T228**Redundant_comp**None**8**it makes>> clear that <<only**T229**Spelling**None**5**lonly>> manufactured goods had about the same share in both methods of transportation as they made 28 percent of all goods which were sent by road. Metals occupied here only eleven percent, <<the proportions**T237**Articles**None**11**proportions>> of minerals and chemicals were a bit larger. The most significant part was provided by food products which composed 30%. Two percent of road transportation was held by machinery.
As an overview, the largest shares of railway transportation <<were accounted for by**T232**lex_item_choice**None**8**came for>> metals and <<those of vehicle transportation, by food**T233**Redundant_comp**None**91**for food for vehicle transportation came for metals and for food for vehicle transportation>>. This can be explained by the distances - trains <<are usually used to transport goods on**T238**Absence_explanation**None**12**usually have>> longer distances and the food might <<not**T236**Spelling**None**3**rot>>. For road transport there are no <<requirements**T237**Category_confusion**None**8**requires>> to transport machinery in such big quantities.
