The bar chart illustrates how the market of print books and eBooks is going to develop in the US, Germany, China and <<the UK**T4**Articles**None**2**UK>> from 2014 to 2018.
First of all, it is clear from the graph that American revenue was and might stay the highest one in both spheres in both periods. <<The second**T5**Articles**None**6**Second>> significant point is <<the unpopularity**T7**Articles**None**12**unpopularity>> of electronic books in China: the <<benefits**T6**Noun_number**None**7**benefit>> from selling them will increase twice but, nevertheless, it is going to stay the lowest #DELETE#3#one with its figures 0,5 and 1 billion dollars in 2014 and 2018 respectively. Regarding other countries, Great Britain seems to be quite stable: the amounts do not fluctuate drastically, <<as they are always about 2 billion**T9**Linking_device**None**31**they are always about 2 billion>>. China and Germany are similar in their love to printed books comparing to their electronic alternatives: in Germany they provide six times more benefit than eBooks and approximately four times more in China. However, at the same time German figures are not that erratic and it is foreseen that they will stay the same. The United States demonstrate <<great signs**T3**Articles**None**15**the great signs>>: from 5,5 bil. US dollars for eBooks (2014) to 10,5 for printed books (also 2014). <<The**T2**Capitalisation**None**3**the>> changes there are not so dramatic: prints are forecast to decline to 7,5 billion whereas eBooks are expected to increase the number of 8,5.
