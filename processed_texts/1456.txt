In our life we are surrounded by a lot of people. By means of status we can divide them into larger groups. Of <<course**T1**Spelling**None**5**corse>>, matter of status is <<an inportant aspect**T3**Articles**None**16**important aspect>> of our life, because we live in a social world. There are <<different**T5**lex_item_choice**None**7**various>> indicators of it. For example, a workplace, a financial position, a charity, luxury goods, new clothes and many others. 

External factors such as clothing and gadgets point to the material aspect, <<it is**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> an indicator of <<an income**T7**Articles**None**6**income>>. So, we understand how much <<a person**T8**Articles**None**6**person>> earns and copying and sharing music or films <<is not**T9**Negation**None**7**needn’t>> for you. 

I think than <<the highest**T10**Superlative_adj**None**6**highet>> <<status**T11**Articles**None**10**the status>> is <<the more**T12**Articles**None**9**than more>> respect you get and you can <<buy**T13**Tense_choice**None**6**buying>> the original discs or something <<different**T14**lex_item_choice**None**6**others>>. Unfortunately, <<many**T15**lex_item_choice**None**4**most>> men have more opportunities for <<success**T16**Spelling**None**6**socced>>, because women usually help #DELETE#8#a family to bring up children, to engage in their education and develop all sorts of skills. 

Musicans <<will not**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**7**willm’t>> have a problem with illegal pirate copies, if people have <<a high matter**T32**Standard**None**16**hight the matter>> of status. I believe that <<I choose**T21**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**choose>> the right way <<to become**T22**Infinitive_constr**None**8**becoming>> a <<designer**T23**Spelling**None**8**designed>> I can work <<anywhere**T24**Spelling**None**10**only where>>: on vacation, abroad, or at home. This profession <<frees**T26**Agreement_errors**None**4**free>> you of a certain place and <<makes you independent**T25**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**independent>>. <<It is**T27**Inappropriate_register**None**4**It’s>> one of <<the types**T28**Articles**None**5**types>> of occupation where women can have a high status. 

Finally, I want to say that the matter of status is important in our lives and <<it is**T29**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> <<a good idea**T30**Articles**None**9**good idea>> <<to earn**T31**lex_item_choice**None**14**increase earns>> money from <<deleting**T32**Spelling**None**5**delet>> illegal pirate copies.
