In the modern world, youngsters commit much more illegal activity than in the past. The number of young people who go to the other side of the law is increasing. Why modern people in their youth become bandits and who should solve this riddle?
Nowadays globalization influenced every country in the world throughout mass media, especially social networks. During past few decades we see how people can change the behavior through these networks. In 2016 Russia suffered from the augmented reality game named Blue Whale. Many pupils and students were fond of this game so much, that they become to kill themselves. The authors of the game decided that they can choose should person live or not. They wrote different threating articles about bad parents and meaning of life in their popular blogs and when they get attention from young minds, they chatted with them as professional psychologists. When person become to believe the quasi-psychologists, the last told him that he should kill himself at 4:20 at the end of the month. Many parents lost their children, because of Blue Whale game. It seemed that mass media would explode; they wrote a lot of articles about this phenomenon. Soon the authors were caught and surprisingly they were youngsters too. Why did this game? Scientist realized that they suffered a lot in school and universities, so they wanted revenge. Their parents didn’t want to pay attention to them.
In conclusion, I want to say that people like these authors are not bad guys, they loss attention. We should cure this problem as fast as possible.
