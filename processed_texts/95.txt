Nowadays we live in the world which is full of extraordinary technologies. The Internet is expanding so that people all over the world have <<an access**T4**Articles**None**10**the access>> to <<the information they need**T36**Absence_explanation**None**15**the information>>. <<With this in view**T37**Linking_device**None**12**In that case>> it is practically impossible to imagine our <<worldwide**T5**Spelling**None**9**word wide>> <<web**T6**lex_item_choice**None**3**net>> without <<illegal**T3**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> content. The speed of spreading of some brand new movies or music <<can**T30**Modals**None**5**could>> be compared with the speed of light, especially if we talk about spreading in social <<networks**T7**Spelling**None**9**net works>>.
On the one hand, these information leaks can be really dangerous <<for**T8**Prepositions**None**2**on>> finances <<of**T9**Prepositions**None**3**for>> producers. Moreover, the process of filming or recording music is very expensive. Some experts <<suppose**T11**lex_item_choice**None**7**suggest>> that losses from <<pirates' actions**T31**Absence_explanation**None**7**pirates>> <<increase**T1**Tense_choice**None**10**increasing>> <<to twice as much**T40**lex_item_choice**None**5**twice>> annually. Ordinary people find it easier to find interesting films on the Internet than to <<go**T12**Redundant**None**6**go out>> and watch <<them**T41**Agreement_errors**None**2**it>> on the full screen. <<Because of that,**T13**Punctuation**None**15**Because of that>> movie producers lose their income. <<As a result**T43**Linking_device**None**9**After all>>, creating movies <<becomes**T44**Tense_choice**None**10**has become>> a non-profit process.
On the other hand, there are a lot of more <<advantages**T10**lex_item_choice**None**4**pros>> than <<disadvantages**T24**lex_item_choice**None**4**cons>> <<of**T14**Prepositions**None**4**from>> illegal <<sharing**T15**Word_choice**None**21**information spreading>> and leaks for musicians. The main point is that#DELETE#1#: if people do not have to pay for music they want to listen to, then they will download and share it with their friends. Firstly, if they like this music, they will buy tickets for the <<band's**T25**Punctuation**None**5**bands>> <<concerts**T18**lex_item_choice**None**4**sigs>>#DELETE#1#. or pay for <<official**T26**Spelling**None**9**officiall>> copies (on iTunes or CDs). <<All in all,**T20**Punctuation**None**10**All in all>> we see that if something <<is given for free**T33**Absence_explanation**None**11**is for free>>, more people will <<use**T19**lex_item_choice**None**6**listen>> it. <<That is why**T21**lex_item_choice**None**12**In this ease>> some musicians post their new albums or songs absolutely for free. The best example is Radiohead. They just let their fans pay as much as they want (or nothing at all) for <<a new album**T27**Articles**None**13**the new album>>.
In conclusion, the <<problem of piracy**T28**Standard**None**14**pirate problem>> can be obviously stated as a <<controversial**T23**Spelling**None**13**controvercial>> one. However, it <<seems**T29**Agreement_errors**None**4**seem>> to me that in the nearest future all information will be <<accessible**T29**Category_confusion**None**8**accessed>> for free without punishing people who want to be free-riders.
