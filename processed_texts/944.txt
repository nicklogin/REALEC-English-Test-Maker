Nowadays social media <<is**T1**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> one of the most important parts of our life. For instance, social media tends to be used as <<an important marketing channel**T2**Articles**None**27**important marketing channel>>. However, each social network has its own target audience. Therefore, social networks may be <<divided**T4**Often_confused**None**9**separated>> by their audience into two groups.
The first group consists of widespread social networks such as Facebook. The target audience of these networks is relatively young: Facebook, for example, has covered 87% of <<younger**T17**Comparative_adj**None**5**young>> people and only 56% of <<older**T8**Comparative_adj**None**7**elderly>> people aged 65+. Actually, the target audience of Instagram is even younger: 53% of <<younger**T13**Comparative_adj**None**5**young>> people covered against 6% of people over 65 years old.
On the other hand, there is <<another**T5**Determiners**None**8**an other>> group of social media. It consists of professional networks, the most well-known is LinkedIn. The distribution of users differs a lot from usual popular networks: it covers equal <<parts**T10**Noun_number**None**4**part>> of <<younger**T14**Comparative_adj**None**5**young>> (18-29) and <<older**T8**Comparative_adj**None**7**elderly>> people (65+) - 22%. 
In my opinion, such an information is quite important for many professionals, especially for PR departments.
<<The knowledge**T11**Articles**None**9**Knowledge>> of the target audience will help to choose <<the right social network**T12**Articles**None**20**right social network>> for advertising something. However, Iâ€™m <<really**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**6**pretty>> sure#DELETE#1#, it's not the only way, when such #DELETE#2#an information is useful.
