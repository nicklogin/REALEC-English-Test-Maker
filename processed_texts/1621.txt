The diagrams illustrate the <<percentage**T171**Spelling**None**10**persentage>> of goods, transported by rail and road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008.
<<Generally speaking,**T172**Punctuation**None**18**Generally speaking>> both ways of transporting goods are used mostly <<for**T173**Spelling**None**3**far>> manufactured goods, <<metals**T174**Spelling**None**6**melats>> and food products.
The biggest part of railway transportation <<is accounted for by**T175**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> metals with 35%, while food is the most <<transported**T176**Spelling**None**11**transporded>> <<goods**T177**Countable_uncountable**None**4**good>> by road with 30%. For both ways of transportation almost <<a third part**T178**Articles**None**10**third part>> <<is made up by**T179**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> manufactured goods with 25% by rail and 28% by road. Chemicals and non-metallic minerals are more transported by road. This difference is not that significant as these two goods <<together**T180**Spelling**None**9**togeather>> have almost <<the same parts**T181**Articles**None**10**same parts>> of <<the pie charts**T182**Articles**None**10**pie charts>> with 11% and about 3% by rail and 16% and 13% by road.
What is more, machinery goods are more transported by rail with 12%, while 2% with road. The main reason for this difference is that machinery <<goods**T183**Countable_uncountable**None**4**good>> <<are**T184**Spelling**None**3**and>> less transportable.
