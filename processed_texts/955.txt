We often see in the news the messages about young people <<committing**T1**Spelling**None**9**comitting>> crimes. Indeed, it is terrifying to hear that some <<schoolboy**T2**Spelling**None**10**school boy>> did an awful thing. The causes of this social phenomenon are highly arguable, <<and so are possible measures**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**20**so possible measures>>. In my perspective, the main causes are living in #DELETE#1#a highly urbanized areas and being exposed to a lot of stress and temptations. To solve the problem, adults must provide the youth with a clear overview of their opportunities and the ways in which they can reach them.
Living in #DELETE#1#a highly urbanized cities affects the self-esteem of young people and their perception of the world. They observe different levels of life, namely #DELETE#3#the great richness and #DELETE#3#the miserable poverty. They see a lot of products they may want to have themselves, but cannot afford yet. Their peers can lure them to do things they otherwise would not do by suggesting them an easy way to get the products of their desire. This easy way is <<committing**T6**Spelling**None**9**commiting>> a crime. Stress may cause the youth to prove themselves to their peers in this way. It strengthens the wish to get what they want <<right**T14**Spelling**None**4**righ>> now.
Although the solution may vary depending on a specific <<case**T7**Spelling**None**4**kase>>, some general ideas can be named. I think it is necessary for parents to clearly state the system of values that they adhere to. They should find a way to make their son or daughter willing to accept it and to share the common values. It is necessary to ensure that the child is not exposed to harmful influence of peer groups. Family values should be <<in**T8**Prepositions**None**2**at>> the first place, and any other opinions should be perceived with reference to them. At the same time, teachers at school should provide an overview of possible things an individual could do for living. <<It can be achieved by describing different professions**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**53**It can be providing an image of different professions>> and better <<understanding**T9**Spelling**None**14**under standing>> of how they may live when they <<grow up**T10**lex_item_choice**None**4**grow>>. It will give the youth the ways in which they can achieve what they want and will allow to avoid the harmful <<uncertainty**T11**Spelling**None**12**un certainty>> which can stimulate them to commit a crime.
To sum up, to lower the crime rate among young people we must provide them with <<aims**T12**Articles**None**8**the aims>> and goals and possible ways in which they can achieve them. This will eliminate the influences of feeling temptations that they are often faced with.
