The increasing number of people consider usage of modern technology as the main reason for a health problems, the number of which increases gradually. The following essay argees that people living in the modern world face different health problems caused by developing technologies and examines some ways leading to the reduction of the problems.
At first, it is very important to mention some of the problems with health caused by modern technologies: (1) the number of people suffering from the heart <<disease**T1**Spelling**None**7**desease>> at a young age increases <<noticeably**T2**Spelling**None**9**noticably>>; (2) due to the increasing number of cars and public transport the noise pollution affects people stronger <<, which**T3**Non_defining**None**5**which>> leads to headache; (3) moreover, it is important to point out that the air pollution, global warming and other ecological factors are the main reason for the cancer <<, which**T4**Non_defining**None**5**which>> does not have a cure at a present time; (4) after all, because of a sitting lifestyle (sitting near the TV, computer, etc.) people have very dangerous problems with their backs.
So, what is the most relevant way to reduce the enormous number of <<health**T5**Spelling**None**5**heath>> problems people have in the modern world? Firstly, it is necessary to control the ratio of the air pollution in big cities: if the air is polluted more than it is not dangerous for citizens <<, there**T6**Punctuation**None**5**there>> should be some <<restrictions**T7**Noun_number**None**11**restriction>> for car holders by the government in the city. Secondly, the government should <<increase the number of ecological projects**T8**Word_choice**None**33**increase some ecological projects>> which can improve the ecological situation.
Overall, the number of health problems caused by modern technology could be reduced if there are some measures improving the ecological situation in a country.
