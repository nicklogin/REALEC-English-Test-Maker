There is an opinion that countries in the world should produce as much food as their population <<needs**T1**Voice**None**9**is needed>> and <<should not**T2**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn’t>> import a lot. I absolutely disagree with this extent and in this essay <<I will**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**4**I’ll>> try to prove my point of view. 

Firstly, all of us live together on the Earth and we should help each other. But I <<do not**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> talk about gifts or presents to other countries, I mean <<economics.**T5**Punctuation**None**10**economics,>> Different countries produce different goods. Food is one of the most important part of trading and producing. But technologies such as modern computers and <<medicine devices**T6**lex_item_choice**None**9**medicines>> are important too. While ones invent new machines, others plant food. It <<can**T7**Spelling**None**2**ca>> be really difficult for one country to produce enough food and enough other goods for all population. <<That is**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**6**That’s>>  why it would be better to import some food and to get some medicines, for example. 

Secondly, the size of countries varies. <<As for Russia,**T9**Punctuation**None**13**As for Russia>> it has <<enough**T10**lex_item_choice**None**9**amount of>> ground to plant food. <<Also,**T11**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> different climates in some parts mean that a lot of types of food can be plain there. But there is a <<small**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**little>> territory in Japan, for example. <<It**T14**Ref_device**None**4**They>> <<cannot**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> produce enough food because of the size of <<the**T15**Spelling**None**5**their>> country. <<As for the number of people living there,**T16**Punctuation**None**40**As for the amount of people living there>> <<it is**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> more than in Russia. Without buying food from other countries it will be hard to exist. <<That is**T19**Inappropriate_register**None**6**That’s>> why it will be great if countries with big territories import their food. 

In conclusion, I would like to say that producing food not only to population of your country helps a lot to other countries and your own one.
