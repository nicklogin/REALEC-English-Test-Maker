The majority of people <<believes**T1**Agreement_errors**None**7**believe>> that <<the use**T2**Articles**None**3**use>> of modern <<technologies**T3**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> is harmful for our health. In my opinion, there are some main health problems and a lot of ways to reduce them.

To begin with, using modern gadgets can cause problems with our <<eyesight**T4**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**sight>>. For example, if <<a person**T5**Articles**None**6**person>> #DELETE#2#is always <<uses**T7**Agreement_errors**None**3**use>> <<his**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> mobile phone to watch different videos, <<his**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> eyes <<will not be**T10**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**will not>> <<okay**T11**Often_confused**None**10**in comfort>>. Besides, a person who <<spends**T35**Spelling**None**4**sped>> a lot of time using <<the Internet**T14**Articles**None**8**Internet>> can <<suffer**T15**lex_item_choice**None**5**cause>> from obesity. Moreover, a lot of people suffer from obesity because of sitting style of life. They spend <<many**T16**lex_item_choice**None**13**more and more>> hours every day <<searching for**T18**lex_item_choice**None**16**to find and more>> information on different web-sites and do not notice that they <<have spent**T20**Tense_choice**None**5**spend>> all day with their laptop and <<forgot**T21**Tense_choice**None**6**forget>> about healthy breakfast and dinner.

As for me, I think that there are a lot of ways to solve health problems. For instance, people can try not to use their gadgets in spare time, <<only use them**T22**Absence_explanation**None**4**only>> <<when**T23**Prepositions**None**3**for>> working. They <<cannot**T24**Spelling**None**7**can not>> <<waste**T25**Redundant**None**8**to waste>> their spare time on the Internet and <<, instead, they can**T26**Absence_explanation**None**13**go for a walk>>, for example. Their eyes will not suffer from <<the screens**T27**Articles**None**7**screens>> of different devices. Moreover, people can <<begin to eat**T28**Infinitive_constr**None**9**begin eat>> healthy food <<on time**T31**Prepositions**None**7**in time>> and work on the laptop. There are a lot of web-sites which can help them to chose <<the right products**T29**Articles**None**14**right products>> and eat them <<on time**T30**Prepositions**None**7**in time>>.

To sum up, we cannot imagine our world without modern <<technologies**T32**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> and some health problems which <<they**T33**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**it>> <<cause**T34**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**6**causes>>. However, there are a lot of ways to avoid <<these**T35**Spelling**None**4**thes>> problems and make our life happier.
