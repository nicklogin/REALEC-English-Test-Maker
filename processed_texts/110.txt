The graph I suppose to talk about has the information about percentage use of popular social networks. This graph can be used to understand what percentage of people from age group in USA (one of four variants) use this social network (Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn).
From this graph we can understand, that older people use social network not regulary, and often do not use them at all. Here is only one example, which does not work like that, I will describe it further. And the second main idea this graph an bring is that Facebook is the most popular social network. All groups of people use Facebook more than other networks.
As I said, in the rule that older people use social networks less often can be found some contrarguments, one of them is LinkedIn. The percentage use of this social network is close to equal betwean ages. It can be explain by the idea of content provided by this social network. Because LinkedIn is a social network for buisness.
