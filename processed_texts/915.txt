Nowadays, people face lots of problems connected with modern technologies. And one of the controversial issues is whethec these modern technologies ave bad foc people's health and what diseases can they cause.
Firstly, some people claim that modern padpets cause problems with sleeping. They argue that people are so involved in chattinp, watchinp videos, lookinp for information that they just forpet to sleep and that may cause serious health problews. However, some people disapree with this point of view, they say that gadpets are not involved in this, as many people use padpets throuphout the day but they can just turn it off oc leave at a remote place while sleeping. Secondly, those who are apainst modern technolopies ensure that wide use of cars which are now available for almost every person pollute the atmosphere and humanity faces significant amount of problems with lungs and heart diseases. On the contrary, other people answer that this problem is, of course, very important but already now many povernments finance the development of the elecric cars and other ecological friendly means of transport. Moveover, the amount of CO2 produced by gasoline cars is always reduced by goverments and automobile companies have to make more ecological cars.
To sum up, I would like to say that, of course, widespread of modern technologies may cause some health problems or ecological problews but at the same time they also help people to make more profound researches to make medicine more effective, to develop more ecological technologies to decrease the atmospere and water pollution level. So, in my humble opinion, modern technologies have much more pluses that minises.
