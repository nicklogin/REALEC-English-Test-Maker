It is argued that people who watch movies and listen to music without officially purchasing such items are considerated as <<thieves**T1**lex_item_choice**None**6**thefts>> and should be punished for this. This essay agrees that ‘pirates’ cause enormous losses to film makers and  producers and should be prohibited #DELETE#16#from such action. The following paragraphs <<will discuss**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**will>> these problem.

First of all, film makers and producers spend significant <<amounts**T4**Noun_number**None**6**amount>> of money in order to create art. Such quantity of funds #DELETE#4#even neglects moral hazards that are often involved in the process. Thus, #DELETE#34#by illicitly and have some profit, artists have to sell their works at certain prices. For example, Apple Music and Spotify – famous smartphone applications – allow users to access a <<myriad**T7**Spelling**None**6**myziad>> amount of <<playlists**T8**Noun_number**None**8**playlist>> and albums within seconds for ten dollars a month.

<<Moreover,**T9**Punctuation**None**8**Moreover>> money is one of the crucial forces that <<inspire**T10**lex_item_choice**None**7**include>> people to work<< without being paid**T11**Punctuation**None**20**. Without being paid>>. Certain artists may become discouraged to work in this field and eventually stop creating music and movies. In this scenario, the whole society will become worse off. For instance, if everything <<was**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**became>> free, producers and musicans  would not have possibly enought funds to implement their bright ideas. Hence, it is particulary important that we, <<as the main audience of artists,**T13**Punctuation**None**31**as the main audience of artists>> support them via officially purchasing their works. <<Additionally,**T14**Punctuation**None**12**Additionally>> the people<< who violate these rules**T15**Punctuation**None**25**, who violate these rules>> <<should be penalized**T16**Voice**None**16**should penalized>> with full responsibility. 

In conclusion, the works of producers and musicians should be protected by the law, and people who illegally copy and further propagate the works should be punished. <<Eventually,**T17**lex_item_choice**None**27**It’s a result of such rules>>, people will be better off as a whole.
