Today more and more professional athletes take drugs to show better results on their competitions. Some people believe that there is no need for a very strict punishment for it: the sportsmen should not be allowed to compete for 2 years. Others #DELETE#3#are suppose that punishment for such cheating should be less mild: such athletes might not compete for the rest of their lives.
So, the first opinion is that such unfair method of winning the games is not something criminal. They #DELETE#3#are suppose that everyone has its own right for mistake. For example, somebody can be too young to understand he is doing a wrong way using the illegal drugs, but after a ban for 2 years he will understand that he should not do such things.
The second opinion is that the cheating in professional sports is cruel and it should be punished very strong. If one <<has**T5**Tense_form**None**4**have>> cheated, he should not have a chance to take part in professional sport anymore. <<Nevertheless,**T2**Punctuation**None**12**Nevertheless>> it is not very democratic, it will be a good way to preserve unfair competition.
As for me, I totally agree with the first opinion. <<However,**T3**Punctuation**None**7**However>> the use of illegal drugs in athletics is awful, it is just a mistake that can be forgotten if the athlete does not breaks the law anymore. We all do the wrong things in our lives; so do the athletes. The matter if one accepts ones mistakes and then doing right.
To conclude, the athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned for sure, but they need <<a**T6**Articles**None**3**the>> chance to make their reputaton good again after the punishment period.
