Some people argue that spending money on <<exploration**T328**lex_item_choice**None**13**investigation>> of space is a waste. And it could be better to spend them on solving society problems.
In my opinion, there could be some arguments for both points of view. Of course, space exploration is the c<<crucial**T3**Spelling**None**7**crutial>>thing in terms of the development of humanity. Today we are facing some p<<problems which could make out living on the Earth impossible**T4**Defining**None**61**problems, which could make out living on the Earth impossible>> for example, overpopulation, climat c<<change**T5**Category_confusion**None**9**changeing>> problems with drinking water.

But I could also agree with people who argue that we should pay<<pay more attention to**T336**Prepositional_verb**None**21**pay more attention on>>day's problems, such as enviromental problems and on-going wars in the Ara<<Arab**T338**Suffix**None**6**Arabic>>gion.
