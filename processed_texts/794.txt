Genereally there is a prejudice that the men who spend a plenty of time regarding sports do nothing but waste their time.Despite the fact that it is quite an arguable issue, I personally disagree with the statement. In this essay I will prove my point of view by presenting various arguments.

To start with,the interests of all the human- beings has been varied since a long time ago. Nevertheless some members are not able to control their personal attitude towards the pastimes of their surroundings. Doubtless,many people do not fond of sport and what is more they even can not stand the idea of this very topic. To illustrate they may ask their relatives to switch off a sport TV programme regardless the fact that anybody adores that very type of sport. In addition sometimes they find it challenging to follow the whole procees of any sport game neither in real nor in virtual platforms.

At the same time people will always be surrounded by those represantatives whose tastes extremely distinguish from one to another.Consequently, in this case what is significant to remember is the evidence that everybody should be tolerant concerning the treatment to different stuff. On the top of it if a person believes that one interest is either absolutely unworthy or is something like a waste of time so they should keep such attitude closer to their chests. Owing to the fact that a modern society is based on such components as the respect, the comprehension and compassion it is really relevant to express any views accurately. Because sometimes there is a risk to offense a human and his personal interests.

To conclude,there is a well- known proverb which can be an example of my personal attitude towards the main statement. It sounds like that: "Many people- many minds" and means that on the one hand people may proclaim that watching sports is useless but on the other hand for me and for many other sport fans the feeling towards the sport events means much more.
