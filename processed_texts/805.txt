The bar chart illustrates the proportion of the usage of three social networks by adults belonging to different age groups in the United States.

It can be clearly seen that Facebook is the most popular online network among all age groups, with more than four-fifth of people aged from 18 to 29 and more than a half of the people from other age groups using it.
On the contrary, Instagram and LinkedIn are not as <<so**T253**lex_part_choice**None**2**as>>dely used. While slightly more than a half of the younger generation have an Instagram account, only a quarter of people aged from 30 to 49 communicate via this network. As for those who are 50 years old or more, Instagram users make up a small minority.
The difference in the percentage of those who have LinkedIn accounts is less dramatic. The proportion of users aged from 18 to 29 and those who are at least 65 years old is equal, making up 22 per cent. The figures for those who belong to other age groups, 30-49 and 50-64 years old, are almost identical, with 31 and 32 per cent respectively.

Overall, it can be concluded that Facebook is preferred to other social networks by all age groups in the USA, whereas Instagram is used mostly by younger people and LinkedIn popula<<is popular**T252**Abs_comp_clause**None**7**popular>> approximately a quarter of the whole adult population.
