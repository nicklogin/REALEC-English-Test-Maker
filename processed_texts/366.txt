Nowadays, a crime rate is quite high in almost every country <<in comparison to**T1**lex_part_choice**None**15**if comparing to>> the past. Statistics tell that the number of youngsters who <<commit**T2**Spelling**None**8**committe>> crimes <<is increasing**T3**Agreement_errors**None**14**are increasing>> year by year. In my opinion, there are some general causes of this trend and possible sollutions. In my essay I will describe them.

However, the problem may stem from a broken home or parents who do not care<<care about their children**T23**Absence_explanation**None**4**care>>o. When parents have conflicts they may divorse, and a child stay<<stays**T12**Tense_form**None**4**stay>>h one of the parents. In such situ<<a situation**T24**Articles**None**9**situation>>child do n<<does not see**T13**Tense_form**None**10**do not see>>h parents often because the one who he or she is living with has to work a lot.

To tackle this problem, parents should care and not <<never**T15**lex_item_choice**None**3**not>>get about thei<<their children's**T16**Possessive**None**14**their children>>cation.

To sum up, nowadays, there are many young criminals, far more than it used to be. There are quite a lot of situations that can lead to crimes commited by children. However, there are many ways to stop t<<prevent**T19**lex_item_choice**None**4**stop>> And the ones who can help children are mostly their own parents and teachers.
