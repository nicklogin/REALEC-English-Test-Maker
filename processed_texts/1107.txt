Many people like <<listening to music**T1**Prepositional_verb**None**15**listening music>>, watching movies and nowdays there are a lor of <<ways**T2**lex_item_choice**None**8**varietis>> how to download it and <<people always do it for free**T3**Standard**None**28**always people do it for free>> <<, but**T4**Punctuation**None**3**but>> it becomes a big issue for people<< who produce this product**T5**Defining**None**26**, who produce this product>>.

Firstly, <<I would**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**3**I’d>> like to say that with <<the invention**T8**lex_item_choice**None**5**event>> of <<the 21st century**T9**Articles**None**12**21st century>> – <<the Internet**T10**Articles**None**8**Internet>> our life <<is**T11**lex_item_choice**None**5**makes>> more easy, #DELETE#7#because everything you want to know, every music you want to hear, every movie you need to see – all of this we can <<find**T13**Tense_choice**None**5**found>> <<on**T14**Spelling**None**2**un>> different sites and download #DELETE#5#these for free. Let’s consider the advantage and disadvantage <<of**T16**Spelling**None**2**og>> this problem. The <<plus**T18**lex_item_choice**None**4**cous>> of <<that**T19**Ref_device**None**2**it>> is that  we <<do not need**T17**lex_item_choice**None**12**haven’t need>> <<to spend a lot of money on movies**T20**Prepositions**None**34**to spend a lot of money for movies>>, music. You can download many albums of your favorite groups, <<watch**T21**Tense_choice**None**8**watching>> #DELETE#17#huge qualities of <<movies**T23**Noun_number**None**5**movie>> and <<do not**T24**lex_item_choice**None**7**haven’t>> <<pay attention to**T25**Prepositional_verb**None**16**pay attention of>> your money. <<On the other hand**T27**Prepositions**None**17**By the other hand>>, <<it is**T26**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> not right for people<< who made this**T28**Defining**None**15**, who made this>>, because they send #DELETE#4#huge money, their <<time**T30**Noun_number**None**5**times>> to produce it and for them <<it is**T31**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> <<a job**T32**Articles**None**3**job>>. I think is unfair for them.

<<For a lont time**T34**lex_item_choice**None**20**A big period of time>> in Russia there <<were**T33**Tense_form**None**7**are was>> a lot of pirate copies. Teenagers could download their <<favorite**T35**lex_item_choice**None**9**loweliest>> music from <<different**T36**Category_confusion**None**10**difference>> <<social sites**T37**lex_item_choice**None**8**sociealy>> like VK  or some web sites like torrent and <<musicians**T38**Noun_number**None**8**musician>> and producers <<lose**T39**Tense_choice**None**5**losed>> <<a lot of**T40**lex_item_choice**None**8**enormous>> money <<because of**T41**lex_item_choice**None**2**on>> it. 

Finally, I think that people have to pay for their downloads.
