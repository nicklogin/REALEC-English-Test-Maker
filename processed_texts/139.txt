It is obvious that our world develops very fast today providing higher life quality to the Earth population. But there is an evidence that young people commit crimes more often than ever before. Why? In this essay I will try to explain my point of view on this situation.
In my opinion, there are two main reasons of this evidence. The first is a very fast growth of population. There are so many children, becoming young adults, and there will be even more. The point is that it becomes hard - to develop new institutions that can organize new generation, because we have to do it too fast. Even though schools and univercities try to take this function, this is not enough.
And the second reason of this situation is a high level of freedom, I think. I don't want to say that this is our world's disadvantage, let's take it as a fact - today humans have more rights and possibilities to do what they want than before. So, this can explain why young people have a feeling that they can commit some crimes without being punished.
Of course, these causes are not the only. Parents and teachers can influence children to prevent crime future. They should talk about morality principles, about the peaceful world everyone wants to live in. They should control what kind of literature, movies and social networks the child likes, because violence and crimes in the book and stimulate a young man to do the same.
So, I think, the high crime rate among young people is the consequence of little organization, no-control over the children, and high level of freedom, making them believe that they can do whatever they want without any punishment. But, in my point of view, this problem can be solved by right policies and influence from older generation.
