Nowadays#DELETE#1#, youth crime is a significant issue in modern life, often <<people**T13**lex_item_choice**None**8**dwellers>> are afraid just to <<go out**T14**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**go>> for a walk because sometimes it is really dangerous <<, and**T15**Punctuation**None**3**and>> the biggest threat is teenagers who do crimes without any thoughts about #DELETE#6#future <<consequences**T2**Spelling**None**12**consiquences>>.

There are a huge amount of ca<<reasons**T18**lex_item_choice**None**6**causes>>hy young people do<<commit crime**T3**lex_part_choice**None**9**do crimes>>First of all, I suppose that the main reason why the crime activity develops be<<among**T19**lex_item_choice**None**7**between>>eenagers is the lack of attention from their parents and teachers, <<:**T20**Punctuation**None**1**,>>a<<maybe**T4**Spelling**None**6**may be>>hey just want to pa<<get**T21**lex_item_choice**None**3**pay>>h#DELETE#9#at very attention by do<<committing crimes**T6**lex_part_choice**None**12**doing crimes>>For instant, children even can become a mu<<murderer**T22**Spelling**None**6**murder>>t the age of 15 because they want to be noticed. I consider that it is really importatnt an<<that**T24**Conjunctions**None**3**and>>rown-ups should help young people who ha<<have**T7**Tense_form**None**3**has>>uch thoughts.The second reason is different movies about violence and crime.They give children an understanding ab#DELETE#14#out the fact that to<<being**T27**Tense_form**None**5**to be>> robber or a mu<<murderer**T25**Noun_number**None**6**murder>>t#DELETE#2# is normal an#DELETE#37#d then at the everything will be OK , but it is a movie, in real life it is much more serious.

I really believe that parents and teachers need to figh<<fight against**T30**Prepositions**None**10**fight with>>se causes for <<: for example,**T31**Punctuation**None**11**for example>>y should respect the <<children**T32**Redundant_comp**None**12**the children>>y <<try to make them understand**T11**Absence_explanation**None**22**try them to understand>>t is good and bad, pay attention to t#DELETE#7#hem to ever<<every**T35**Suffix**None**8**everyone>>ividual meth#DELETE#9#od of behavior, especially if youn<<a young person**T37**Articles**None**12**young person>>e<<has**T38**Tense_form**None**4**have>>e problems in family or at school and <<, and**T39**Punctuation**None**3**and>>o go to psychologist with him <<him**T40**Absence_explanation**None**3**him>> not <<not allow a small child to watch TV**T41**Absence_explanation**None**41**not allow to watch TV being a small child>>n my point of view, I am sure that adults need to help youth <<the young**T42**Adj_as_collective**None**5**youth>>al with their problems and th<<, and**T43**Punctuation**None**3**and>>I guess the youth <<number of youth crimes**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**youth crimes>>be reduced.
