At the moment prohibited drugs are used in sport more often than it was earlier. <<There are**T5**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**There>> two views on punishment for this action. The radical one is to forbid <<athletes**T6**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> to anticipate competions <<for their whole life**T34**Standard**None**16**whole their life>>. The calmer one is to prohibit them <<from participating**T34**Prepositional_verb**None**14**to participate>> for a certain period. Nowadays this problem is really burning and I would like to resolve such a dichotomy.
Adherents of the first opinion posit that the limited period of prohibitance could be an impact to self-development and just a good example for sportsmen. For instanse, the eminent german boxer Max Gr√§ber was <<banned**T11**Spelling**None**5**banne>> for two years. <<Soon after the punishment,**T13**Punctuation**None**25**Soon after the punishment>> he became a world champion. He told that <<the**T12**Spelling**None**3**thi>> <<prohibition**T14**Derivation**None**13**prohibitation>> stimulated him to mundane training. He even supposed that if he had not been banned, he would not have won the Olympic Games. The <<allies**T15**Noun_number**None**6**allyes>> of this theory say that small periods <<of ban**T24**Prepositions**None**6**to ban>> just <<stimulate the risk**T25**Transitive**None**17**stimulate to risk>> <<of**T26**Prepositions**None**4**with>> <<drug use**T27**Word_choice**None**5**drugs>>. The cost of <<speed**T41**Category_confusion**None**4**fast>> is not so high.
<<Concerning the second idea,**T16**Punctuation**None**26**Concerning the second idea>> it is difficult to underestimate its severity, but no one has any doubts in its efficiency. The most considerable example is the enermous fuss <<with**T28**Prepositions**None**2**on>> drugs in <<the UK**T17**Articles**None**2**UK>>. Despite the fuss, victims of this punishment <<end**T18**Word_choice**None**6**finish>> their sport career <<completely**T19**Word_choice**None**6**at all>>. <<Human rights groups**T29**Word_choice**None**23**Amators of human rights>> highlight the austerity of this punishment <<and**T21**Spelling**None**3**ant>> the lack of educative element in this commitment. <<Mutatis mutandis,**T23**Punctuation**None**16**Mutatis mutandis>> in <<the UK**T22**Punctuation**None**2**UK>> this system is working. #DELETE#8#There is no <<occasion**T36**Prepositions**None**11**on occasion>> of drug use <<was**T38**Redundant_comp**None**7**was not>> <<recorded**T39**Word_choice**None**5**fixed>> <<since**T40**Prepositions**None**5**until>> the <<adoption**T30**Word_choice**None**10**acceptance>> of this law.
<<To summarize,**T2**Punctuation**None**13**To summarize,>> I have no professional opinion about this relevant problem, but as a defender of human <<rights**T4**Word_choice**None**5**rules>>, <<and the adherent of the educative model of punishment,**T31**Punctuation**None**53**and the adherent of the educative model of punishment>> I would agree with the first opinion. I have no doubts in great efficiency of the second one, but I think that <<the educative part**T35**Articles**None**14**educative part>> <<is much more important for every human being**T33**Standard**None**44**for every human being is much more important>>.
