<<Nowadays**T1**Punctuation**None**9**Nowadays,>> there is one interesting opinion about <<the producing of food**T4**Prepositions**None**18**the producing food>>. <<Some people say**T5**lex_item_choice**None**9**Ones said>> that every country should take care about getting food inside <<the country**T6**Articles**None**7**country>> as much as <<it**T7**Ref_device**None**4**they>> can. <<In my opinion,**T8**Punctuation**None**13**In my opinion>> #DELETE#7#is that the goverment should firstly think about <<the economical factors**T10**Articles**None**18**economical factors>> of producing food. 

To begin with, there are more than 200 countries in the world, so we <<cannot**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> have an universal receipt of how and where <<to get**T13**Infinitive_constr**None**3**get>> and produce the food. For example, russian territory is not good <<acceptable**T14**lex_item_choice**None**6**enough>> for planting some fruits, but <<people**T15**lex_item_choice**None**10**population>>, who <<live**T16**Agreement_errors**None**5**lives>> there, <<need**T17**Agreement_errors**None**5**needs>> to eat them to get <<vitamins**T18**lex_item_choice**None**20**a needable resourses>>, so it is <<reasonable**T19**lex_item_choice**None**8**sensible>> to buy them from <<other**T20**Often_confused**None**7**another>> countries. Secondly, food market is one of the largest so there is no economical profit of <<making**T21**lex_item_choice**None**7**closing>> <<markets**T22**Noun_number**None**6**market>> to produce only for <<its own**T23**Absence_explanation**None**3**own>> population.

However, there <<are**T24**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> some disadvantages of having every <<border**T25**Noun_number**None**7**borders>> opened to other countries. Firstly, importing food from abroad <<leads**T26**Spelling**None**3**led>> to negative economical effects. The main importers of food do not have an aim of improving <<the agricultural complex**T27**Articles**None**23**an agricultural complex>> at all. <<That is**T28**Inappropriate_register**None**6**That’s>> why for such a long time Russia<<, country with the biggest size of fields,**T32**Non_defining**None**45**, the country with the biggest size of fields>> <<do not**T31**Tense_choice**None**6**didn’t>> planting as much as <<it**T33**Ref_device**None**3**she>> can. So, more and more farmer’s families became very poor. In addition, when most of food<< which a population eats**T35**Defining**None**25**, which a population eats>>, is <<produced**T36**Tense_choice**None**9**producing>> incide <<the country**T37**Articles**None**10**of country>>, less money is gong away from it. <<Protecting**T38**Prepositions**None**13**Protecting of>> national agriculture can be very profitable for a government because of #DELETE#7#getting more taxes from <<its population**T40**Possessive**None**12**a population>>. 

However, <<a country**T41**Articles**None**7**country>> should be sensible in <<understanding**T42**Tense_choice**None**10**understand>> <<its**T43**Ref_device**None**5**thein>> planting possibilities. Severe climate countries should buy food from other countries with warmer climate or <<invest**T44**Tense_choice**None**9**investing>> in developing <<the new ways**T45**Articles**None**8**new ways>> of getting <<food**T46**Articles**None**6**a food>> for <<its**T47**Ref_device**None**5**their>> <<population.**T48**Punctuation**None**11**population,>> <<All that**T49**Absence_explanation**None**3**All>> <<depends on**T50**Prepositional_verb**None**13**depends about>> what is more profitable and good for people.
