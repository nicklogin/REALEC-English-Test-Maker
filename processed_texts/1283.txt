   The illustrations demonstrate structures of transportation by rail and by road in 2008 in Eastern Europe. 

Overall, food products were mostly transported by road, while metals and machinery were transferred by rail. Both roads and rail were intensively used for <<manufactured goods**T1**Possessive**None**18**manufactured goods>> transportation. 

To begin with, metals were the major good for <<rail transportation**T2**Absence_explanation**None**4**rail>> with 35% of all <<goods**T3**Noun_number**None**4**good>> transported #DELETE#2#in that way,  comparing to only 11% transported by road. The proportion <<of**T5**Prepositions**None**3**for>> machinery transportation was six times higher using railways than roads. By contrast, <<food products**T6**Possessive**None**13**food products>> transportation is only 11% for railways, while the proportion for road transportation is 30%. However, there are some goods which were transported in similar proportions for both road and rail transport. The percentage <<of**T7**Prepositions**None**3**for>> <<manufactured goods**T8**Noun_number**None**18**manufactured goods>> transportation were almost the same with 28% transferred by road and 25% by rail. 

In conclusion, a significant difference can be seen only in metals, food products and machinery transportation.
