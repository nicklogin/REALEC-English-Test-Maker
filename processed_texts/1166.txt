This picture <<illustrates**T1**Transitive**None**14**illustrates us>> the information about <<the temperature**T2**Articles**None**11**temperature>> <<in two cities**T3**Prepositions**None**13**at two cities>><< which are located in different climate zones**T4**Defining**None**46**, which are located in different climate zones>>. 

Both graphs show us <<the average data**T6**Articles**None**15**an average data>> of maximum and minimum points <<in every month**T7**Prepositions**None**14**at every month>> but the situation in Yakutsk is more variable <<than in Rio de Janeiro**T8**Prepositions**None**19**than Rio de Janeiro>>. When the positive temperature in Yakutsk is only at summer period, Rio de Janeiro #DELETE#2#is stabily has <<the temperature**T10**Articles**None**13**a temperature>> higher than zero. The situation <<at**T11**Spelling**None**2**ar>> the beginning of <<the year**T12**Articles**None**6**a year>> in Yakutsk is the rapid growth of temperature <<indicators**T13**Spelling**None**10**indicaters>> to getting <<a peak**T14**Articles**None**8**the peak>> at summer, in July. After #DELETE#4#year equator <<the average temperature**T16**Articles**None**19**average temperature>> falls like a rocket to the lowest point in December. #DELETE#2#As about Rio de Janeiro, <<the amplitute**T19**Articles**None**14**that amplitude>> of maximum and minimum monthly #DELETE#10#indicators is about 10*C. Boths graphs <<show**T20**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> the same thing: the difference between maximum and minimum average parametres in one month is usually less than 15*C. 

To sum up, both cities show us very different <<climats**T21**Noun_number**None**7**climate>>. <<Whereas people**T22**Punctuation**None**15**Whereas, people>> <<in Rio de Janeiro**T23**Prepositions**None**17**at Rio de Janeiro>> always spend more their time <<in warm weather conditions**T24**Prepositions**None**28**with warm weather conditions>>, Yakutsk is usually frozen at winter nights and has a comfortable temperature only at summer.
