The bar chart gives us information about <<the development**T1**Articles**None**11**development>> of <<print books and electronic books production**T2**Absence_explanation**None**32**print books and electronic books>> in <<the USA**T3**Articles**None**3**USA>>, Germany, China and <<the UK**T4**Articles**None**2**UK>> between 2014 and 2018. As the diagram suggest, there are very different situations in these four countries.
First of all, it can be seen that in USA producing of print books in 2014 <<was rather higher**T5**Standard**None**15**rather was hire>>, than in 2018 (in 2014 it was 10,5 billion <<us**T8**Capitalisation**None**2**us>> dollars, but in 2018 it will be only 7,5 billion US dollars). In #DELETE#3#the contrast, in Germany producing of <<these**T10**Pronouns**None**4**this>> books remains stable (6 billion US dollars in 2014 and 6 billion in 2018). Secondly, the bar chart illustrates how <<the development of the book market changed**T11**Standard**None**42**changed the development of the book market>> in China and in the UK. It is clear that in China <<it was**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**was>> not a lot of changes: producing of print books in 2014 was 4,8 billion US dollars and in 2018 - 4,2 billion US dollars. Producing of electronic books <<slightly**T14**lex_item_choice**None**6**slowly>> rised. Similar situation is in <<the UK**T15**Articles**None**2**UK>>.
