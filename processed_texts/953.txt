<<The amount**T4**Articles**None**6**Amount>> of young people, who <<commit**T21**Agreement_errors**None**8**commites>> crimes, has <<risen**T1**Tense_form**None**5**rosen>> in <<the past few years**T5**Articles**None**14**past few years>>. People <<are concerned**T6**Voice**None**9**concerned>> with this problem, and we should find reasons#DELETE#1#, why <<adolescents**T28**Inappropriate_register**None**9**teenagers>> <<commit**T8**Spelling**None**7**commite>> crimes, and how we can solve this problem.
The first reason of this problem can hide in a childhood. Nowadays parents spend a lot of time at work. This causes <<a lack**T25**Articles**None**4**lack>> of time<< which parents should spend with their children**T22**Defining**None**48**, which parents should spend with their children>>. This lack leads us to <<a lack**T26**Articles**None**4**lack>> of education about good and evil, and <<consequences**T29**Spelling**None**12**concequences>> of evil steps. There could be another reason of our problem. Poor families quite often have more than one child. If parents don’t try to educate their children properly before school, children can get in some bands. People from these bands can provide teenagers with money, but they will ask <<young people**T27**Inappropriate_register**None**9**teenagers>> to do some “dirty job”.
There are a lot of <<solutions to**T10**Prepositional_noun**None**12**solutions of>> this problem. First of all, parents should <<pay**T9**lex_part_choice**None**4**give>> more attention to their children and spend more time with them. These points can increase trust in future, and parents will be able to understand#DELETE#1#, with whom their <<children**T12**Noun_number**None**9**childrens>> are communicating more. <<Therefore**T13**Spelling**None**8**Therefor>>, government should pay more attention to the poor group of nation, and make thought-provoking propaganda about crimes. These measures will help children to avoid marginal groups of people.
In conclusion, I would like to say#DELETE#1#, that <<the problem**T15**Articles**None**7**problem>> of <<the rising amount**T16**Articles**None**13**rising amount>> of <<young people**T17**Inappropriate_register**None**10**youngsters>><< who commit crimes**T18**Defining**None**22**, who commites a crime>>#DELETE#1#, can be solved by parents, teachers and government. The main idea is to <<dedicate**T20**lex_item_choice**None**4**give>> more time and <<to pay more attention**T21**Lack_par_constr**None**9**attention>> to children and their social life.
