The diagrams given in the list represent some statistics about means of transport which <<are being used**T1**Voice**None**9**are using>> to <<transport**T2**Verbs**None**11**transported>> goods. The data <<were**T4**Agreement_errors**None**3**was>> collected in Eastern Europe in 2008.
Transporting goods by road and by rail are similar in some aspects. The percentage of manufactured goods and chemicals in overall transportation is practically identical in both cases (25 and 28; 11 and 16 accordingly). However, many differences exist <<as well**T3**Linking_device**None**4**also>>. Metals are transported by rail three times more than by road. The difference in transporting machinery is even more significant: the percentage of machinery transported by road is six times less than the same metric in the case of transportation by rail. On the contrary, producers of non-metallic minerals and food products tend to use roads when they want to transport their goods.
To sum up, producers of food products and non-metallic minerals pefer to choose transportation by road, while producers of metals and machinery are more likely to use rail to transport their goods. Finally, producers of chemicals and manufactured goods didn't show any significant preferences in means of transportation.
