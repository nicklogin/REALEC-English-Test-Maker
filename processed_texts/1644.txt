Nowadays there are a lot of discussions about <<sportsmen**T333**Noun_number**None**9**sportmens>> who use illegal drugs. Today's pharmacy <<allows athletes to achieve**T334**Verb_Inf**None**23**allows athletes achieve>> great results in a short period of time and without difficult exercises. That is why some people claim that such kind of <<athletes**T335**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> should be banned from competing in professional championships at all but <<others**T349**Articles**None**10**the others>> say that the period when one can not take part in <<competitions**T340**Noun_number**None**10**competiton>> should be limited. 
First of all, the people who <<claim**T350**Tense_form**None**6**claims>> on disqualification of the athletes who <<were**T336**Agreement_errors**None**3**was>> <<caught in the act of using drugs**T347**lex_part_choice**None**21**caught on using drugs>> break down the spirit of honest and clear competition. That is why, they can not be judged the same way as others. Because of being liers and cheaters such athletes should be grounded and they won't be <<able to come back**T337**Prepositional_adjective**None**14**able come back>> to professional sport.
It is difficult for some people to accept <<such a point of view**T338**Articles**None**18**such point of view>> that is why they argued that we can not forbide athletes who used illegal drugs to take part in professional competitions forever because it is their profession and we can not let them live without job for the rest of their life because of <<one mistake**T339**Articles**None**15**the one mistake>>. But such opponents do not take in mind the fact that some illegal drugs lead to unacceptable changes in the <<athlete**T341**Spelling**None**6**athlet>>'s body and that is why they can not be judged like the other who do not use illegal <<drugs**T342**Spelling**None**6**drug's>>.
It is clear for me that people who think that <<athletes**T343**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> should not be banned forever can not be absolutely right because sport means honesty and true spirit of competition. If we deny it we deny the definition of professional sport.
<<In conclusion,**T345**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> it is better to say that sport is <<such a kind**T344**Articles**None**9**such kind>> of human activity that do not accept any kind of lie and cheating. So, illegal drugs should be banned and the sportmen who <<were**T346**Agreement_errors**None**3**was>> <<caught in the act of taking them**T348**lex_part_choice**None**21**caught on taking them>> also should be disqualified.
