Crime rates and public safety have always been the themes which concern the public. And now, when young people crime rates are higher than ever before, government and society are interested in the causes of the sudden increase in the level of crimes commited by young people and in the ways of solving this problem. This essay states that the causes of this development can be found in exsessive control of the young people and that the logical solution of this problem is to give them more freedom in their actions.
Before thinking about how to solve the problem we should understand the reasons why it did appear. As it was stateted above, the reason of the increase in crime rates by young people is the exsessive control of them from parents and teachers. The latter in order to provide education, right behavior, and safety restrict a lot of things: from watching cruel TV-shows to visiting some places and communication with their friends. The reaction of young people is the protest against such norms. To show that they do not agree with the way parents and teachers bring them up, they do something prohibited. And this has resulted in breaking the law. 
In order to solve this problem parents and teachers should accept a paradoxical thing: to lower the young people crime rates we should give them more freedom and stop to control them exsessively. Indeed, if teenagers were given more freedom in their actions, they would be happier and more satisfied with their current life and environment and would not try to do something prohibited to express their protest.
Parents and teachers, in their attempt to give a proper education, manners and behavior to teenagers, have reached the opposite thing - the increase in the level of crimes committed by them, because breaking the law is the protest agains exsessive control. Of course there are other reasons why young people have begun to break the law more often, but his one is the most important and requires an immediate solution.
