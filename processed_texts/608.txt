Nowadays it is often <<said**T380**Often_confused**None**4**told>> that travelling by <<plane**T387**Noun_number**None**6**planes>> has become quite dangerous for the ecological situation all over the world. Of course, that is an important thing to worry about because, unfortunately, global problems are becoming more and more <<important**T388**lex_item_choice**None**6**actual>> for <<the modern society**T381**Articles**None**14**modern society>>. However, is it fair to put the blame on this kind of means of transport?
Personally, I strongly believe that life in 2<<the 21st century**T382**Articles**None**12**21st century>>without planes and so on is absolutely impossible. Firstly, everyday routine requires the possibility to get to some other countries and even continents in h<<a few hours**T389**Absence_explanation**None**5**hours>> To be honest, the technologies are not progressive enough to create a faster way to move around the world. People who obtain important posts just have no alternative but jet or plane if they have to get to, for example, the USA from Russia.
Secondly, other means of transport like cars, trains, ships also keep on having hu<<a huge influence**T390**Articles**None**14**huge influence>>n our nature. The gas from cars pollutes roads, fo<<forests**T383**Noun_number**None**6**forest>>nd other places people go, the need to build railways makes workers destroy already mentioned forests, change rivers' direction. There is no way of creating facilities for transport which can be totally safe for the planet.
Last but not least, the most dangerous enemy of the world is <<are**T384**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>>mans. All the places that we discover become comfortable for our<<relaxing**T391**Coherence**None**14**our relaxation>>aving fun or even working but extremely impossible for trees to grow, for animals to breed and for natural complexes to exist. We do not think about how the planet is going to survive our invasion and forget that we make it only worse that way for ourselves.

To make a conclusion, it is pretty important to understand that technologies are not going to stop its development because we have already got used to such <<such a speed**T385**Articles**None**10**such speed>>ife. Scientists should do all their best to invent maximally exological means of air transport, cars, etc. All we can do is to tr<<try**T392**Infinitive_constr**None**6**to try>>espect the resources of our planet and take care about the word we think we own.
