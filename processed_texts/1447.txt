Nowadays there is almost nothing impossible <<thanks**T1**Category_confusion**None**8**thankful>> to modern technology. But some of them become a cause of different health problems. So, the question is how to make the damage less?

On the one hand, modern <<technologies**T2**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> bring not only the <<benefit**T3**lex_item_choice**None**3**use>> but health problems too. Some of them <<are connected**T4**Voice**None**9**connected>> with computers, mobile and TV screens, simply saying, with gadgets which we use every day. People suffer with eye <<pain**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**sick>> because of harmful screen shine. Nowadays more and more people need glasses and the cause is not a biological <<factor**T6**Noun_number**None**7**factors>>. Also, the Internet makes our brains less functional. Problems with memory and attention are developing because of link system and the huge <<amount**T7**lex_item_choice**None**6**volume>> of information. Such problems can lead to mental <<diseases**T8**Spelling**None**8**desieses>>. Technologies in food industry can also be harmful for people. Fast food is <<a high-calorie meal**T10**Articles**None**17**high-calorie meal>> which leads to <<problems**T11**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> with stomach and also with <<the weight**T12**Noun_number**None**7**weights>>.

On the other hand, modern technologies are friends of human beings. We have enormous amount of possibilities thankful to them. <<Medicine**T13**Spelling**None**8**Medecine>>, the Internet <<provide**T14**Agreement_errors**None**8**provides>> knowledges and information for free, so everybody can use it. Transport <<lets**T15**Agreement_errors**None**3**let>> people to travel all around the world and <<makes**T16**Agreement_errors**None**4**make>> it easy. The last but <<not least**T17**Articles**None**13**not the least>> <<are the possibilities**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**17**the possibilities>> of medicine. Today there is almost no <<diseases**T19**Spelling**None**8**desieses>> which are not treated. So, I think that the solution of health problems <<is in our hands**T20**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**in our hands>>. Knowing about <<the harmful affects**T21**Articles**None**15**harmful affects>> of the Internet, screens, mobile phones and so on we can control our use of it.

In conclusion, it is important to say that our health is only under our control. We do not need to give away the power and responsibility for our state. <<If you think that technologies are harmful,**T22**Punctuation**None**42**If you think that technologies are harmful>> do not use it.
