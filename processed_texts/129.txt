I strongly disagree with <<the statement**T1**Articles**None**11**a statement>> that countries only need to <<produce**T2**Spelling**None**7**producc>> the food that their own population eats and should aim to import as little as possible. Open economics model, first of all, <<helps countries concentrate**T5**Verb_object_bare**None**30**helps countries to concentrate>> their efforts on their <<competitive**T4**Spelling**None**11**compatitive>> advantages and produce more food and <<produced**T6**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> it more efficiently <<, which**T3**Conjunctions**None**4**what>> makes the world economy more effective. <<The second reason**T7**Articles**None**13**Second reason>> is that because of import <<, people**T8**Punctuation**None**6**people>> can afford more types of food and can be <<happier**T9**Comparative_adj**None**12**more happier>>. The third reason is that open economy creates competitive <<environment**T10**Spelling**None**12**environement>>. <<That**T11**Capitalisation**None**4**that>> <<pushes**T13**lex_item_choice**None**10**stimulates>> companies to be more effective and provide more <<food of better quality**T12**Prepositions**None**24**food with better quality>> for lower prices. <<So not only do countries**T14**Ambitransitive**None**21**So not only countries>> concentrate on their advantages but they also get incentives to make their <<products**T15**Spelling**None**7**poducts>> more affordable <<, which**T16**Conjunctions**None**4**what>> brings more value to society overall.
The first reason <<is**T18**Tense_choice**None**3**was>> the focus of <<countries**T17**Spelling**None**8**cantries>> on their advantages. <<has**T19**Agreement_errors**None**11**Brasil have>> one of the best climates to grow <<cocoa**T20**Spelling**None**5**cacao>> beans, but they have <<no technologies**T21**Redundant**None**20**no such technologies>> to make Oreo <<cookies**T22**Spelling**None**8**coockies>> out of <<the beans**T23**Articles**None**5**beans>>. If <<decided**T24**Tense_choice**None**13**Brazil decide>> to built Oreo technologies and <<the USA**T26**Articles**None**3**USA>> <<started**T27**Tense_choice**None**5**start>> to grow beans they <<would**T28**Tense_choice**None**3**wil>>l spend a lot of <<money**T29**Spelling**None**5**maney>> and will get very s<<little**T31**Quantifiers**None**4**mall>> output, therefore <<it is**T32**Inappropriate_register**None**9**it’s just>> more effective for them to focus on their competitive advantages and produce both products more.
The second reason can be <<explained with**T33**Prepositional_verb**None**12**explained on>> the same example. If <<the USA**T34**Articles**None**3**USA>> and Brazil <<stopped**T35**Tense_choice**None**11**had stopped>> trading, Americans <<lose**T36**Tense_choice**None**13**would’ve lost>> possibility to buy as much <<cocoa**T37**Spelling**None**5**cacao>> as they want for <<the same**T38**Articles**None**10**same price>>, while Brazilians <<would lose**T39**Tense_choice**None**13**would’ve lost>> the possibility to find Oreo on shelves of their stores. So it is better to trade and eat more and be happier. 
<<The third reason can also be explained with the same example.**T40**Absence_explanation**None**37**The third reason on the same example.>> If Brazil <<stopped**T41**Tense_choice**None**11**had stopped>> to sell beans to <<the USA**T43**Tense_choice**None**3**USA>>, African countries <<would be able**T44**Tense_choice**None**13**would’ve been>> able to raise prices for the beans they sell to <<the USA**T45**Articles**None**3**USA>>, because they <<would**T46**Tense_choice**None**4**will>> <<have**T47**lex_item_choice**None**3**get>> more monopoly power. Therefore, it is important to have <<competition**T48**Noun_number**None**12**competitions>> <<in the markets**T49**Prepositional_noun**None**10**on markets>> <<, as it**T53**Coherence**None**4**– it>> creates incentives for all producers to be effective and keep prices lower.
<<Therefore,**T54**Punctuation**None**9**Therefore>> it is crucially important to import goods. It <<helps make**T50**Verb_Bare_Inf**None**13**helps to make>> economies more effective, provides people with more variety of food and <<makes international companies compete**T51**Verb_object_bare**None**40**makes international companies to compete>> <<so that they**T52**Absence_comp_colloc**None**7**so they>> become more effective and cheaper.
