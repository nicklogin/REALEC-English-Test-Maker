The represented chart illustrates the unemployment rate in certain world regions in 2014 and 2015 years.
<<As we can see from this chart,**T1**Punctuation**None**29**As we can see from this chart>> the unemployment rate <<insignificantly**T2**Prefix**None**15**unsignificantly>> <<had changed**T3**Tense_choice**None**7**changes>> in all regions. The Middle East and Latin America <<had**T4**Tense_choice**None**4**have>> <<a decrease**T5**Articles**None**8**decrease>> in their rate no more <<than**T6**Often_confused**None**4**then>> <<by 2 per cent**T7**Prepositions**None**10**2 per cent>> in 2015. However, only <<the EU's unemployment rate**T8**Articles**None**22**EU's unemployment rate>> <<got**T22**lex_item_choice**None**5**lifts>> up from 7,5 per cent to 7,9 per cent. <<Although**T12**Spelling**None**8**Althouth>>, the most remarkable feature from the shown chart is the rates from three regions left that <<remained**T13**Tense_choice**None**6**remain>> stable without any slight drop or rise. <<Despite the changes,**T15**Punctuation**None**19**Despite the changes>> the highest unemployment rate <<belonged**T16**Tense_choice**None**7**belongs>> to <<North Africa**T17**Articles**None**16**the North Africa>>, while the lowest rate <<was**T18**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> demonstrated by South <<Asia**T19**Spelling**None**4**Asie>> that <<was**T20**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> only 3,9 per cent.
To sum up, I would like to mention that changes in the unemployment rate can be practically not observe, hence, the majority of represented <<rates**T21**Noun_number**None**4**rate>> <<was**T22**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> flat in both years 2014 and 2015.
