Today we are living in the era of new technologies. There is no <<doubt**T323**Spelling**None**5**doupt>> that they make our <<lives**T324**Spelling**None**5**lifes>> easier, but there are some negative <<consequences which**T326**Defining**None**19**consequences, which>> can lead into health problems. This essay is going to describe <<main problems**T327**Articles**None**15**a main problems>> and try to find out a solution for them.
To begin with, the most popular drawback of using modern gadgets is <<connected**T328**Spelling**None**8**conected>> with eyes. Children and working people spend hours sitting in front of the digital screen. It makes their eyes tired and when it happens days by days it can lead into <<permanent**T329**Spelling**None**9**permanend>> lose of sight level.
What is more, people nowadays use phones and headphones a lot. These <<gadgets**T330**Spelling**None**7**gangets>> <<produce**T331**Spelling**None**7**produse>> microwaves to <<connect**T332**Spelling**None**6**conect>> with each other and <<World Wide Web**T351**lex_part_choice**None**14**world wild web>>. These microwaves harmfully <<influence**T333**Verb_pattern**None**12**influence on>> brain if you use gadgets regularly.
In <<addition**T334**Spelling**None**9**addiction>>, children these day spend much more time playing computer <<games**T335**Spelling**None**5**gamer>> rather than outdoor ones. That is why they are less sportive and sometimes even have some serious problems with their back.
However, <<technologies**T336**Spelling**None**11**tecnologies>> develop not only in the way of usage, but also in a safety way. <<producesrs**T337**Spelling**None**9**Produsers>> today are thinking about <<harmful**T340**Spelling**None**8**harmfull>> effects of their products and <<always**T338**Spelling**None**5**alway>> try to <<reduce**T339**Spelling**None**6**reduse>> them. In some <<modern**T341**Spelling**None**6**morden>> countries this problem is even regulated by laws. If we are talking about <<problems that were mentioned in this essay**T343**Defining**None**44**problems, that were mentioned in this essay,>> it must be said that screens are getting safer for eyes every year and <<the harmful effects of microwaves is being reduced**T346**Absence_explanation**None**23**microwaves are reducing>> as hardly as it is possible. If we are talking about sitting lifestyle of children, <<this problem**T347**Absence_explanation**None**2**it>> should be solved only by their <<parents**T348**Spelling**None**7**parends>>. Sports these day are developing as well.
To conclude, there is no doubt that tecnologies develop and can harm our <<health**T349**Spelling**None**5**helth>>, but they also develop in sphere of their safety.
