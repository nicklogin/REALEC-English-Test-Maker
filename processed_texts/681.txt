The presented charts illustrate the amount of different types of goods in a persentage transported by rail and by road in 2008 in countries of Easten Europe. Overall, it is a general trend that the transporting of manufactured goods has one of the highest persentage in both cases. However, the highest in the first pie chart is metals compared with food products in the second one.
In the case of rails it is clear from the diagram that the leaders are metals and manufactured goods (35 and 25 percent respectively) while the chemicals and food have both 11 persent of transporting, and machinery has 12. The lowest persentage here (6 percent) have non-metalic minerals.
In the other chart the different statistics is shown. The most popular types of goods in this case are food and manufacturing (30 and 28 percent respectively). The less transported in 2008 were machinery goods which have only 2 percent. The others types of goods were not very different in a persentage (16 percent for chemicals, 13 percent for non- metalic materials and 11 for metals).
