There are a great ammount of different activities that can entertain and make our lives more exciting. Many people prefer wathing variable sport events or sports on TV. But some individuals claim that doing this is a useless spending of time.
I absolutely agree with this arguement. First of all, when watching someone succeeding, you personally are doing nothing. I strongly believe that every person should imrove himself and not follow someone's success. Our free time is a perfect capability to do something useful, to become better and stronger, to even start doing sport by yourself. Not only watching sports is a waste of time, but it also takes a lot of money, because some sport events may be pretty expensive. That is why, I think, developing yourself is much more vital and significant, than watching someone plays football or bowling, for example.
The second thing is that addiction to sports among population increases governmental payment. I agree, that doing sports is the main point in every sportsman's life and he wants to be needed and paid. But, in my opinion, usually athlets are overpaid. In my country, there is a very important problem of eledrly people, ill children and others. Unfortunately, many people are strongly needed to buy remedies and to be cared, but the greates sums of the country's budget go to our football team salary. I totally disagree with this type of politics, that is why I think, that wathcing TV games or going to sport events regularly just makes sportsmen very rich and common people poorer.
In conclusion i would like to add, that every person can do any activity he wants, but i strongly suggest, that watching sports rather than even just doing it by yourself is a useless waste of time.We should imrove our minds and bodies every day and minute, doing something useful by yourself is moch more important.
