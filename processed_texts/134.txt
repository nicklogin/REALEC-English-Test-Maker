In the bar chart we can see percentages of adults who use social networks for Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn presented for four age groups.
We can see for both Facebook and Instagram that the higher is the age of user, the lower is the percentage rate. For Facebook there are 87% of users in age of 18-29 and only 56% in age of 65+. LinkedIn, on opposite, has higher percentage for two middle-aged groups, 30-64 combined. The 18-29 and 65+ groups have just over one fifth equally.
The most popular social network is Facebook: the lowest rate there - 56% is higher than the highest rate in two other social networks. We can't say which of two social networks: Instagram and LinkedIn is more popularity depend on the age group. For instance, Instagram has 31% more users for age 18-29 but it has almost three-times less For 50-64 age group comparing to LinkedIn.
Finally, there is a dramatic decline in popularity for different age groups who use Instagram from 53% to 6% while percentages of other social networks don't fluctuate so much.
