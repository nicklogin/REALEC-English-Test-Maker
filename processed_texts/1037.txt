Music and cinema industries are faced with the problem of copying and sharing their products on the Internet without agrement. These industries loose a lot of money because of it. I agree with the position that illegal sharing of content on the Internet is theft. But I think that the low should punish only people who share these products, not who downoland.

Nowadays, making films or recording songs or albums cost a lot of money. And one of ability to return this money is showing films in cinematheatres or buying music content in the Internet appstore, for example, iTunes or Google Play. If the song or film is on the Internet, people do not buy it legal or do not want to go to the cinema because he or she can watch it at home in chair. So ‘pirates’ don’t allow companies to return their money. So this phenomen of modern society is theft.

I repeat once more, I think that only people who share illegal content should be punished. Some musicians or directors may share their products themselves. So, people, who downoland some contents, don’t know who shares this.

To sum it up, copying and sharing music or films on the Internet is serious problem for makers. The government should take necessarying lows for solving this problem.
