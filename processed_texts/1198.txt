In the 21th centure <<the human population**T1**Articles**None**16**human population>> growns rapidly. <<It**T2**Ref_device**None**4**That>> is the reason why the question about food production becomes very important. Now we are close to meet face to face the problem of overpopulation. And our generation must solve a lot of issues to make <<the future**T3**Articles**None**6**future>> for our children real. 

Coming back to food production, there is <<a popular**T4**Articles**None**12**popular idea>>, that every country should produce food only for <<its**T6**Ref_device**None**5**their>> own citiezens. It is <<an interesting point of view**T7**Articles**None**25**interesting point of view>>, because <<we all know**T8**Standard**None**11**all we know>> that <<the priority of**T9**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**priority>> geverment’s job is to take care of <<its**T10**Ref_device**None**5**their>> people. If <<a country**T11**Articles**None**7**country>> <<produces**T12**Agreement_errors**None**7**produce>> enough food for <<its**T13**Spelling**None**4**it’s>> own people, the government <<does not**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**7**doesn’t>> need to <<spend money on**T15**Prepositions**None**15**spend money for>> growing and upgradeing food production, <<instead**T16**Spelling**None**7**tnstead>> of this that money can be saved for solving other problems. <<But what**T19**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**But>> if some other <<countries**T17**Noun_number**None**7**country>> <<cannot**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> produce enough food? Should we keep <<calm**T20**Spelling**None**4**canl>> and just look how many <<people**T21**Spelling**None**7**peoples>> die? This question is still open. 

<<On the other hand,**T22**Punctuation**None**17**On the other hand>> we have <<an opinion**T23**Articles**None**11**the opinion>> that countries should help each other. So, if some country can produce more food, it should be done. But where is the edge of this help? How much money <<should be spent on**T24**Prepositions**None**19**should be spent for>> producing the food for other countries and <<how much on**T25**Prepositions**None**12**how much for>> <<education**T26**Category_confusion**None**10**educateing>> (medicine help, etc) <<of contry's**T27**Prepositions**None**8**contry’s>> own <<citizens**T28**Spelling**None**9**citiesens>>? 

Today nobody has <<an answer**T29**Noun_number**None**7**answers>> on this <<question**T30**Noun_number**None**9**questions>>. But the time  is up, and the solution mush be found. <<As for me**T31**lex_item_choice**None**17**Accordingly to me>>, <<the**T32**Spelling**None**4**they>> only right way is to help each other. We are all people. We should remember about it in difficult <<situations**T33**lex_item_choice**None**5**times>>, and do our best to save each life.
