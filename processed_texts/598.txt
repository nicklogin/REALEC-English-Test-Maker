Nowadays traveling <<to**T1**Prepositions**None**3**for>> work ar business puposes <<has become**T21**Tense_choice**None**6**bacame>> a signifacant <<part**T4**Spelling**None**3**par>> of people's lifes. Few would <<dispute**T5**Spelling**None**7**despute>> the fact that travelling by plane is the most <<convenient**T6**Spelling**None**9**conviniet>> way to get to another place, although it produces an outstanding amount of gases. Whether the government should make any steps in order to decrease the number of air travel is a controversial topic worth discussing.

On on<<the one**T7**Articles**None**3**one>>ide, many people are of the op<<opinion**T9**Spelling**None**7**opinoin>>hat the government itself should step in and provide us with some law, which would reduce the amount of air travel. To begin with, it would be better for everyone to have a legal, strict directions about, << how and when one person can fly**T8**Punctuation**None**33**, how and when one person can fly>>as it would make an impact on greenhouse gases and global warming. In addition, it would not confuse anyone or create arguments about, << who's turn it is to take a flight**T11**Punctuation**None**35**, whose turn it is to take a flight>>because people could just see the legitimate document, providing them with needed information. Moreover, this law could be useful for government co#DELETE#5#uld as well, since it would have a better control over the income of the all airline companies.

On the other side, there is the <<a**T13**Articles**None**3**the>>w that the laws that the government would introduce might not help the contemporary situation. Firstly, these laws would inte<<interfere**T14**Spelling**None**10**interfeare>>h<<into**T15**Prepositions**None**4**with>>ple's personal life, thus causing arguments and controvercies. Secondly, government might overtake the whole air traveling sector and organise a monopoly on air travel. And thirdly, so far there is no possible way that kind of law could be introduced properly and accepted by the public.

In conclusion, it is obvious that air travelling laws is a v<<are**T16**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>>y provocative topic. But personally, I believe that some laws that would have and ef<<an**T18**Spelling**None**3**and>>t on the decrease of politi<<pollution**T19**Spelling**None**8**polition>>eeded. Therefore, I would advice for th#DELETE#3#e government to make airline companies turn to natural resources and use enviro<<environmentally**T21**Category_confusion**None**13**environmental>>ly fuel.
