In general, graph shows that elderly (65+) rarely use social networks, comparing to younger ones. For this age group the least popular network out of 3 listed  is "Instagram", which is also the least used in all ages, excluding the youngest (18-29). In  most cases, social networks are more popular between younger people. This rule has only one exeption: "LinkedIn" has more users in "30-49" age group, which is probably caused by specific aim of this network. While "Facebook" and "Instagram" are mostly used for attraction, "LinkedIn" helps people with finding jobs. 
The most popular network is "Facebook": more than two thirds of all people use.
