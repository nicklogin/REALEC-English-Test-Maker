The pie charts illustrate the transportation of goods by rail and road in Eastern Europe throughout 2008.

Overall, it is obvious that the transportation of metals was the most dominant in case of rail one, whereas there were not as many transported metals in case of road transportation. <<Manufactured goods' transportation**T1**Possessive**None**33**Manufactured goods transportation>> was the leader by roads, but <<manufactured goods transported by rail**T2**Word_order**None**38**transported manufactured goods by rail>> accounted #DELETE#3#for almost the same number. 

Looking <<more detaily**T15**Category_confusion**None**13**at the detail>>, machinery goods accounted #DELETE#3#for only 2 per cent of all transported goods by road and it is the least number #DELETE#2#of at all. <<Metals transported by road had the second least percentage**T8**Standard**None**54**The second least number had metals transported by road>>, <<which is**T10**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**with>> 11%, as compared to chemicals #DELETE#5#goods and food products transported by rail. Food products transported by road was one third of all road transportation, <<but this percentage**T12**Conjunctions**None**15**this percentage>> was not as many as manufactured goods with 28%. <<In case of rail transportation,**T14**Punctuation**None**30**In case of rail transportation>> manufactured goods were just over <<twice as many as**T15**Numerical**None**15**twice more than>> machinery goods (12%) and chemicals and food products.
