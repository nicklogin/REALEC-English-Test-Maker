Every person <<in**T1**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the world thinks that the sport competitions should be fair, there can be no doubt in it. But how strict should be the punishment for being unfair? Let us discuss the problem of illegal drugs, where some people claim that the people who use illegal drugs should be banned from the professional competition temporarily, while the others argue that they should be banned permanently.
Personally, I think that there can be no excuse for cheating in the professional sports competition, especially if it is very important, for example, world championship, or <<Olympic**T11**Capitalisation**None**7**olympic>> games, that is why <<i**T10**Capitalisation**None**1**i>> think that people who use illegal drugs should be banned for the rest of their lives.
Firstly, <<the temporary bans will**T6**Punctuation**None**24**the temporary bans, will>> not be much of a reason for the sportsmen <<to not use drugs**T7**Infinitive_constr**None**19**to not to use drugs>>, because after the time is gone they will continue their career as if this situation never took place before. It is obvious for me that many of them tried to use drugs at least once, just to see what happens. Only the complete ban from the future professional <<competitions**T5**Noun_number**None**11**competition>> will solve the problem, as it will encourage fear of using drugs among the sportsmen.
However, many of <<people**T8**Articles**None**10**the people>> will disagree with this opinion. They will argue that the complete ban from future professional <<competitions**T3**Noun_number**None**11**competition>> will sometimes result in misjudment and spoiled <<careers**T4**Spelling**None**8**careeres>> <<of**T9**Prepositions**None**3**for>> the sportsmen. The complete ban from the professional competition is too severe to be a solution in their opinion.
Nevertheless, I cannot agree with their opinion. Misjudgement is a part of every law and can happen any time, no matter how strict are the laws themselves. If a person is misjudged somehow, he can prove his innocence, and the lack of evidence can also be a reason for innocence.
In conclusion, I would like to say that sport is a sport and it must be fair. There can be no place for illegal drugs and for people who try to use them in their own interest.
