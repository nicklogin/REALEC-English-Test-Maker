<<According to many sources of information,**T1**Absence_explanation**None**17**According to many>> computers and other technologies have strong influence on our <<lives**T2**Often_confused**None**5**lifes>>. The main problem of <<overusing them**T13**Agreement_errors**None**14**them overusing>> is weakness of health system, particularly heart <<problems**T3**Noun_number**None**7**problem>>. The possible solution is <<introduction**T48**Redundant_comp**None**14**an implication>> of <<obligatory sports**T16**Formational_affixes**None**16**sport obligation>> at schools and universities. This essay is <<going**T4**Spelling**None**5**goint>> to <<describe**T17**Spelling**None**8**discribe>> health <<problems**T18**Noun_number**Dependent_change**7**problem>> and <<possible solutions to them**T21**Absence_explanation**None**22**them possible solution>>. First of all, <<people who have sedentary lifestyle are in danger of developing problems with their heart**T23**Word_order**None**68**the heart problem is a danger of people who have sedentary lifestyle>>. It is <<obvious**T48**Category_confusion**None**9**obliously>> that computers and other technologies <<are required**T25**Voice**None**11**are require>> to be <<near**T26**Category_confusion**None**6**nearly>> <<a table**T27**Articles**None**5**table>> or other places. For instance, over the period from 1990 to 2005 <<most families**T28**Redundant_comp**None**20**the most of families>> that <<own**T29**Agreement_errors**None**4**owns>> computers <<preferred**T30**Tense_choice**None**6**prefer>> to put it on the table #DELETE#15#in certain room. Therefore, if somebody <<wanted**T32**Tense_choice**None**5**would>> to surf <<the Internet**T6**Articles**None**8**Internet>> #DELETE#12#or what else he or she would pass some time sitting <<at the table**T34**Prepositions**None**5**table>>. <<Besides**T36**Linking_device**None**7**Despite>> the <<benefits of**T35**lex_item_choice**None**9**fact that>> modern technology <<brings for**T37**Prepositional_verb**None**13**is widespread>> the government and family <<, it can**T38**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**can>> <<have**T39**Category_confusion**None**4**make>> a negative effect <<as well**T40**Redundant_comp**None**29**from its using less dangerous>>. #DELETE#27#A case of point is that the <<People**T42**Capitalisation**None**6**people>> who <<use**T7**Agreement_errors**None**4**uses>> computers <<a lot**T8**Quantifiers**None**6**a lots>> <<should be**T43**Modals**None**12**should to be>> <<informed about the need for**T44**Absence_explanation**None**13**advertised by>> sport activity. This aim <<can be achieved**T45**Modals**None**22**will be able to embody>> by, for example, obligatory <<physical**T9**Spelling**None**8**phisical>> education at school and university. Also, it is conspicuous fact that if different kinds of sports become more popular and less costly, some groups of people, especially teenagers, will spend their time on outside activities instead of sitting <<at home**T46**Prepositions**None**4**home>>. To conclude, this essay <<supports**T47**Agreement_errors**None**7**support>> healthy lifestyle because it <<helps**T10**Agreement_errors**None**4**help>> to fight with the negative consequences of <<overusing**T48**Redundant_comp**None**12**overusing of>> electronic devices.
