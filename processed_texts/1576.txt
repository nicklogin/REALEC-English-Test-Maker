According to the popular opinion, the expansion in the use of modern technology leads to <<an increase**T2**Articles**None**8**increase>> <<in**T3**Prepositions**None**2**of>> health problems. This essay <<agrees**T23**Agreement_errors**None**5**egree>> with <<the statement**T19**Articles**None**9**statement>> due to some reasons. First there will be mentioned some possible health problems caused by technologies, then some ways of their reduction will be named.
To begin with, one of the most widespread problem is a <<disease**T4**Spelling**None**7**desease>> of a back. This <<is**T8**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> likely to be related with <<the using**T5**Gerund_phrase**None**3**use>> of <<the computers**T6**Articles**None**9**computers>> at home and <<at work**T7**Lack_par_constr**None**11**for working>>, because such activity is in a sitting pose, which is the most unwanted for a healthy spine. <<The second**T9**Articles**None**6**Second>> problem <<, that is obvious,**T10**Punctuation**None**15**that is obvious>> is a reduction of vision quality<< -**T11**Punctuation**None**1**,>> caused by a constant eyes efforts while people are watching <<the monitors**T12**Articles**None**8**monitors>> or using their devices. Other points concerning with microwaves, <<radio waves**T13**Spelling**None**10**radiowaves>>, radiation and other things, which negative effects are not proved, will not be analyzed below.
To avoid <<diseases**T14**Spelling**None**8**deseases>> of spine<< -**T15**Punctuation**None**1**,>> people should not <<-**T16**Modals**None**2**to>> spent much time in a <<unchangeable**T20**Spelling**None**11**unchangable>> sitting position, for instance, it is <<necessary**T21**Spelling**None**10**nessessary>> to make some physical <<exercises**T22**Spelling**None**9**exersises>> during working, if it is possible, some computer activities should be done lying on the floor, at home, for example. Similarly, eyes should change their focus time after time to reduce the negative <<effects**T23**Spelling**None**7**affects>>, also it is recommended to watch at something green-coloured, such as plants and other objects.
To summarize, health problems are often related with an increasing role of the technologies in people lives, but this unwanted effect might be neutralized, following some important rules.
