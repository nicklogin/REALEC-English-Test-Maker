No one can <<raise an objection to**T1**Prepositions**None**18**raise an objection>> the fact that the entertainment industry plays <<an important role**T2**Articles**None**14**important role>> in our life. Some <<people**T3**Spelling**None**7**peolple>> believe that people<< who illegally copy private products and upload them to the Internet**T4**Punctuation**None**70**, who illegally copy private products and upload them to the Internet,>> are criminals. I definitely agree with this statement <<, and**T5**Punctuation**None**3**and>> I will prove it in this essay.
Firstly, not only producers of films and music lose their money. <<Government also suffer from illegal copies**T329**Punctuation**None**48**The government also suffers from illegal copies,>> because <<if**T8**Spelling**None**2**of>> people have a free <<access to**T326**Prepositions**None**10**access for>> <<entertainment**T9**Spelling**None**13**ententainment>>, huge companies will go away from <<national**T10**Spelling**None**8**nationcl>> market. As the result, the government will have <<a lack**T11**Articles**None**4**lack>> of taxes. <<For example, many American firms don’t enter Russian market because Russian authorities don’t deal with illegal products.**T14**Punctuation**None**173**For example, many American firms don't enter Russian marketAmerican firms don’t enter Russian market, because Russianthe Russian authorities don’t deal with illegal products>>
Secondly, this situation <<strongly**T333**lex_item_choice**None**8**strictly>> influences social habits and behaviour. If people have a chance to watch films and <<listen to**T16**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> music at home, they will stop going to cinemas and <<concerts**T17**Spelling**None**8**conserts>>. Therefore, social communication will <<be reduced**T18**Voice**None**6**reduce>> seriously. 
However, others think that illegal pirate copies is <<a good opportunity**T19**Articles**None**16**good opportinity>> to educate and develop #DELETE#2#as the other parts of society. In my opinion, this opinion is incorrect and it causes <<real problems**T335**Articles**None**17**the real problems>> <<among**T20**Prepositions**None**7**between>> different social groups. Moreover, there are special state programmes and web sites, which government creates for sharing materials <<with**T339**Prepositions**None**3**for>> poor people.
In conclusion, as some individuals continue sharing music and films, it badly <<affects**T22**Transitive**None**9**effect on>> musicians and producers, <<governments**T26**Spelling**None**10**goverments>> and <<the whole society**T23**Articles**None**13**whole society>>. <<The government**T30**Articles**None**9**Goverment>> loses additional profit from <<taxes**T27**Spelling**None**5**faxes>>, consumers <<don't**T28**Agreement_errors**None**7**doesn’t>> have <<an incentive**T29**Articles**None**9**incentive>> to <<spend**T30**Spelling**None**5**spent>> money on entertainment. Political and economic leaders should change the situation in the nearest future.
