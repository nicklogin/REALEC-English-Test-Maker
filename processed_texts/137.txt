The problem of crime between youngest part of the society was always important. The level of the crime of children and teenagers strictly reflects the future for decades. Nowadays this question is even more important then before because young people start to commit more crimes. It is possible to find some connections between crime level and level of the education, economic situation.
If we look at past, we will find that for a centuries young people were required to work in field for example. They needed to work hard to help their family to survive. Children from rich families studied in academies with very strict control for them. It is not hard to see that young people had not had enough time to do crime. Nowadays the situation is completely different. Except of some African and Asian countries, the world is enough developed to allow young people to be free. The problem of crimes are committed by young people strictly connect to the level of the education, I think. Without public education children from poor families are not able to get an education. They miss the lessons about society, do not get understanding of evil and good, which is usually described in the classical literature. Also problems with economic situation may lead to increasing in crime level. If there is high rate of unemployment, young people are forced to do crime, because it is the easiest way to make money for food and cloth.
Parents and teachers are able to improve the situation. It is important to provide right moral values for children. Young people need to see kind and honest people around them except of greedy millionairs in TV-shows, who are able to do everything for money. It is also important for parents and teachers to teach young people to love classic literature, as the archive of human wisdom.
