The pie charts show how the goods were transported between <<Eastern**T6**Capitalisation**None**7**eastern>> <<European**T9**Capitalisation**None**8**european>> countries in 2008. 
Overall, the metal is a dominant good transported by rail while the food products dominate as the goods transported by road.
To begin, at the first chart metals are the most popular product to transport, reaching 35%. The proportion of manufactured good is also significant and <<reaches**T8**Spelling**None**6**reachs>> 25%. The <<machinery**T2**Capitalisation**None**9**Machinery>> has 12%. The chemicals and food products are equal and both have 11%. The <<non-metallic**T3**Capitalisation**None**12**Non-metallic>> are transported the least.
In contrast, the second chart demonstrate the dominance of food products with 30%. The manufactured products are 2% lower than food, reaching 28%. The <<chemicals**T1**Capitalisation**None**9**Chemicals>>, non-metallic minerals and metals reach 16%, 13% and 11% respectively. The machinery has the lowest <<percentage**T9**Spelling**None**10**persentage>> with 2%.
Finally, two pie charts demonstrate different trends. The metal is the main good transported by rail and the food is the most popular product transported by road.
