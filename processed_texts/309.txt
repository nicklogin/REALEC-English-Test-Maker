Nowadays pirating <<becomes**T1**Agreement_errors**None**6**become>> a huge problem for musicians, film authors and writers. But is it obligatory to fight with pirates or we can find another way to solve the problem?
We <<live**T2**Tense_choice**None**10**are living>> in the century of <<the Internet**T3**Articles**None**8**Internet>>, so for many people copying and sharing files is a daily routine. Must they be punished for <<this**T4**Pronouns**None**5**those>>? I think it is not their fault.
The problem <<is that**T5**that_clause**None**2**is>> the web services that sell films, music and books are not always comfortable for users. For example, two years ago buying music for your <<iPhone**T6**Spelling**None**6**Iphone>> was a long process <<, and**T7**Punctuation**None**3**and>> free downloading was <<easier and quicker**T8**Comparative_adj**None**19**more easy and quick>> for users. But now there is a service called Apple Music which helps you to <<download**T9**Spelling**None**7**downoad>> legal music for a small fee. Most of my friends have changed the way of listening to music since the Apple Music service came to Russia.
The second point is what authors think about pirates. Not each musician, film director or writer <<consider**T10**Spelling**None**8**concider>> that those who <<download**T11**Agreement_errors**None**9**downloads>> files <<illegally**T12**Spelling**None**8**illegaly>> should go to jail. For example, the sons of Russian <<science-fiction writers**T17**lex_item_choice**None**8**fantasts>> brothers <<Strugatskiy**T15**Spelling**None**12**Strugatskiye>> make the web-versions of the books free. The main argument is “who <<wants**T16**Agreement_errors**None**4**want>> to pay – will pay”. Many musicians also do the same thing.
In conclusion, I would like to say that we must take it easy. <<Content authors**T17**Spelling**None**15**Content-authors>> will not stay poor. Their fans will always find the way to pay them for work. If they respect authors, of course.
