The given diagram represents the statistic data on <<the usage**T14**Articles**None**5**usage>> of three social networks by <<people from different age groups**T15**Absence_explanation**None**20**different age groups>> of <<American**T12**Adjectives**None**3**USA>> <<Internet**T13**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> users. Percentages of people, who like specific <<resources**T16**Spelling**None**9**resourses>>#DELETE#1#, are quite impressive, because nearly all adults are involved in online chatting, information sharing <<significantly.**T18**Punctuation**None**13**significantly>>
In case of Facebook, it has more users than <<other networks do**T19**Abs_comp_clause**None**14**other networks>>: even in the oldest group, <<the members of which**T1**Absence_explanation**None**3**who>> do not use <<the Internet**T27**Articles**None**8**internet>> much, Facebook leads with 56% versus only 6% for Instagram and 22% for LinkedIn. Of course, <<younger**T29**Comparative_adj**None**5**young>> people, <<who enjoy communicating with peers,**T4**Non_defining**None**34**who enjoy communicating with peers>> are <<are largely involved in this social network, with the percentage of 87%**T20**Absence_comp_sent**None**35**87% involved in this social network>>. The trend is going down <<as**T6**lex_part_choice**None**5**while>> <<the age**T7**Articles**None**3**age>> of users increases: almost 1/3 rentnors <<are users of**T9**lex_part_choice**None**6**sit on>> Facebook than students.
We observe the same situation when we look at <<the Instagram data**T11**Articles**None**14**Instagram data>>: <<younger**T28**Comparative_adj**None**5**young>> people are the majority of all users (53% vs 42% of adults). By the way, the speed of trends slumping is <<higher than it is for Facebook**T21**Absence_explanation**None**6**higher>>: elderly people <<share pictures 9 times more rarely than young do**T24**Standard**None**61**are nearly 9 times more rarely sharing pictures than young do>>.
On the contrary, <<the LinkedIn data**T25**Articles**None**13**LinkedIn data>> demonstrates the correlation between age and social role of users: mostly working people aged 30 to 64 use LinkedIn for obviously business purposes, though students and reenty graduates as well as older people are <<use this network less by only 8-9%**T26**Tense_choice**None**44**only 8â€“9% use this network less this network>>.
