The graph compares the usage of three social networks by American adults from four different age groups.
One of the first things to note is that Facebook seems to be the most popular type of the Internet communication among all age groups. Particularly, a big majority of adults <<from 18 to 29 years old**T1**Absence_comp_sent**None**13**from 18 to 29>> use this network. In addition to this, more than 70% of the second age group (30 - 49 years old) prefer to use Facebook, while only 56% of the oldest age group are Facebook users.
As for Instagram, it is also quite popular among the youngest age group, with approximately half of this group being users of this network. Instagram is <<rarely**T2**lex_item_choice**None**6**poorly>> used by the <<older**T4**Comparative_adj**None**7**elderly>> people, only 6% of the <<oldest**T3**Ref_device**None**4**last>> age group use it.
Finally, LinkedIn is the only social network where the percentage of 30 – 49 #DELETE#1#- years old users overtakes the percentage of 18 – 29 #DELETE#1#- years old users. A significant part of people from 50 #DELETE#1#- to 64 years old also use LinkedIn (about 30% of them).
Overall, as the age of people grows both Facebook and Instagram become less popular. Only LinkedIn has a relatively equal distribution of users by age.
