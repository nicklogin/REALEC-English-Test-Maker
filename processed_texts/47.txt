International community regularly rises the question – what should we do to struggle against illegal pirate copying <<successfully**T1**Spelling**None**11**sucessfully>>? Musicians and film producers have huge <<losses**T2**Spelling**None**5**loses>> every year. How can we prevent such situations in future?
<<From one point of view,**T3**Punctuation**None**22**From one point of view>> <<an illegal distribution of films and music**T5**Articles**None**41**distribution of music and films illegally>> shouldn’t be stopped. Popular musicians get money from tours around the world: if millions of people like <<their**T8**Agreement_errors**None**4**your>> music, songs,  performances, they will buy ticket <<to**T7**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the concert. <<Practice**T9**Spelling**None**8**Practise>> shows that mostly unpopular singers <<respond**T10**lex_item_choice**None**7**relates>> negatively to <<an illegal distribution**T12**Articles**None**20**illegal distribution>> of their songs, <<because**T13**lex_item_choice**None**2**so>> they don’t have another source of getting money, because their concerts are badly organized <<, and**T14**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<noone**T17**Spelling**None**6**no one>> <<buys**T15**Agreement_errors**None**3**buy>> <<tickets to them**T16**Absence_explanation**None**7**tickets>>. Creations of <<talented**T18**Spelling**None**8**talanted>> musicians should be <<acceptable to**T20**Prepositional_adjective**Dependent_change**14**acceptable for>> people of all nations, <<stratums**T19**lex_item_choice**None**7**strates>>, equally <<to**T21**Prepositions**Dependent_change**3**for>> rich and poor, that’s why they must be free.
The opposition of <<the mentioned point of view**T22**Articles**None**23**mentioned point of view>> says that all <<high quality**T24**Category_confusion**None**14**high-qualified>> goods must be <<payed for**T23**Prepositional_verb**None**5**payed>>. The world market of films and songs <<loses**T25**Tense_choice**None**4**lost>> huge amounts of money <<, and**T26**Punctuation**None**3**and>> even laws can’t stop the process of <<spreading it**T27**lex_item_choice**None**10**widespread>>. <<People who take this point of view**T28**Defining**None**36**People, who take this point of view,>> put on various restrictions. For example, it is <<considered**T48**lex_item_choice**None**8**supposed>> that Internet websites<< that**T30**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<present**T31**lex_item_choice**None**6**accept>> music, films or other materials, should make all accounts for visitors not free. If you often visit cinemaparks, you can notice that there are <<lots of**T32**Agreement_errors**None**8**a lot of>> cameras in <<the halls**T53**Noun_number**None**6**a hall>>, where films are watched. That way officials want to stop <<the activity of cameramen**T35**Articles**None**21**activity of cameramen>>, who take <<copies**T36**Noun_number**None**6**a copy>> of <<films**T37**Noun_number**None**4**film>> in <<cinemas**T38**Noun_number**None**10**the cinema>> and <<upload them to websites**T40**Absence_explanation**None**18**upload to websites>> for <<payment**T41**Articles**None**9**a payment>>.
To sum up, the process of <<spreading films and music illegally**T53**Absence_explanation**None**10**widespread>> can be stopped, however, musicians, writers or other creative people <<can attract their fans**T44**Absence_explanation**None**11**can attract>> by the quality of <<their creations**T45**Absence_explanation**None**9**creations>>. So, if songs are popular, people <<will go to concerts**T47**lex_item_choice**None**19**will visit concerts>> even <<if tickets cost a lot**T49**lex_item_choice**None**22**for a big ticket price>>. If <<a film**T50**Articles**None**4**film>> is <<breathtaking**T51**Spelling**None**13**breath-taking>> and unusual, unique, people will come to <<cinemas**T52**Noun_number**None**6**cinema>> to watch a masterpiece on a big <<screen**T53**Spelling**None**6**screne>>.
