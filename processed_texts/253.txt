<<A problem**T1**Articles**None**7**Problem>> of illegal pirate copies is one of the most widely known, because of public <<speeches**T2**Spelling**None**8**speaches>> of musicians, film producers and some other creative people.
There is an opinion that people who download these copies should be punished. I agree with this point of view. <<In this essay i will bring**T4**Ref_device**None**21**This essay will bring>> arguments for this.
The <<quality**T5**lex_item_choice**None**5**worth>> of such copies is low, so people try to get inspiration from a bad product. For example, once I downloaded <<the film**T6**Articles**None**4**film>> “Pirates of <<the Caribbean**T7**Articles**None**9**Caribbean>>” and couldn’t watch it <<longer**T8**lex_item_choice**None**4**more>> than two minutes because of strange sounds <<, spoiled graphics**T9**Punctuation**None**16**spoiled graphics>> and problems with downloading, so I decided to go to the cinema and pay for <<a good time**T11**Articles**None**9**good time>>.
It is <<not habitual**T30**Formational_affixes**None**10**inhabitant>> for people, particularly <<Russians**T14**Capitalisation**None**8**russians>>, to pay for every kind of information <<, and**T15**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<an ability**T16**Articles**None**7**ability>> to find free film or music, or software just makes this problem harder to solve <<to solve**T17**Redundant_comp**None**2**it>>. Because of this, <<an information**T18**Articles**None**11**information>> <<loses**T19**Agreement_errors**None**4**lose>> its unique value for customers. For example, Daniel Roshar got a few <<sales**T21**Category_confusion**None**5**sells>> of product “<<WinRar**T20**Spelling**None**6**WinPar>>” that was invented by him, meanwhile millions of people have it for free.
The third argument is <<an ability**T22**Articles**None**7**ability>> to get harmful software while <<pirate copies' downloading**T23**Gerund_phrase**Dependent_change**22**pirate copies download>>. “Virus”-program can break down your “Windows” at all, or delete files from your computer. And such situation is a real danger, because the biggest amount of dangerous software is spreaded by this way.
To conclude, <<the Internet**T30**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> becomes <<a bad place**T27**Articles**None**9**bad place>> with such files <<, and**T28**Punctuation**None**3**and>> people who download these files should be punished. In a real life, only some people will <<become hit**T29**Verb_part**None**13**become hitten>>, because the biggest part of citizens is going to avoid this and start to buy legal copies from official sites and such resources like “<<App Store**T30**Capitalisation**None**8**appstore>>”. Everyone will get profit except some <<pirates**T31**Ref_device**None**17**pirates resources>> and virus-<<programmers**T30**Suffix**None**12**programmists>>, but we shouldn’t think about their losses.
