Nowadays popular artists suffer a lot from pirating the media content. <<It**T1**Spelling**None**2**If>> results in <<huge money losses**T2**Articles**None**19**a huge money losses>> and a big stress for authors. I absolutely agree <<that**T3**Spelling**None**4**thot>> copying and sharing music or films on the <<Internet**T4**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> is a crime, which should lead to punishment. <<In my essay I will discuss**T5**Ref_device**None**21**My essay will discuss>> why pirating is bad for musicians and film producers and how copyrighters are trying to <<fight**T6**Transitive**None**10**fight with>> illegal copying.
<<As have been already mentioned,**T7**Punctuation**None**30**As have been already mentioned>> the illegal pirate copies are a big problem for profit of <<artists**T8**Spelling**None**5**artis>>, but also it <<harms**T9**Spelling**None**5**harry>> their popularity and digrity. We have seen a lot of cases, when the album or film comes out earlier <<on**T11**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the <<Internet**T10**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> than in theaters or in the shops. Artists <<do**T12**Often_confused**None**4**make>> a lot of work to make their pieces look perfect <<, and**T13**Punctuation**None**3**and>> a marketing campaign, which is closely connected to dates when something comes out, plays a vital role. A good example of this is illegal release of the final episode of the BBC’s drama “Sherlock”. The creators had a lot of problems with preventing spoilers for the big audience.
Copyrighters <<, of course,**T15**Punctuation**None**9**of course>> try to <<fight**T16**Transitive**None**10**fight with>> this problem. The most obvious way is to create laws<< which make copying illegal**T17**Defining**None**29**, which make copying illegal,>> but it is hard to find the criminal and to punish him. The other way is to create good incentives and environment for people <<not to use**T18**Infinitive_constr**None**13**to not to use>> pirate copies. Such services as Spotify, Apple Music, etc. are <<really good examples**T19**Noun_number**None**21**a really good example>>. They give users an opportunity to <<listen to**T20**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> legal music for a small month fee, which is affordable for <<most**T21**Articles**None**8**the most>> of the people.
In conclusion, I would like to say<< that**T22**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> society should help policy makers to prevent pirating. If every citizen <<think**T14**Tense_choice**None**10**will think>> about illegal sharing as a crime, the copying and pirating will be a big shame and no one will do this.
