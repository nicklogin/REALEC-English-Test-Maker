The crime activity among younger generation is <<an issue**T30**Articles**None**9**the issue>> of concern in many countries. The reasons of increased attention to this topic is the jump of the frequency of law breaks among <<young people**T29**Inappropriate_register**None**8**youngers>>. What is the cause of such unusual growing of criminal activity? And what steps should society take to prevent <<a further increase**T28**Articles**None**16**further increase>> of crime <<committing**T1**Spelling**None**9**commiting>> children and teens? As for my opinion, the main reason <<of**T31**Prepositions**None**2**to>> law disobediance is lack of support from other parts of society. That is why parents and teachers should be ones to fix this situation by giving more attention to youngers they look after.
The social pressure, stress, depression, troubles with friends, first love and lack of time are the main problems youngest generation faces very frequently and knows too good. <<Adolescents**T34**Possessive**None**5**Teens>> hormonal changes and mental distability prevents them from solving these problems successfully all alone. That is why they tend to solve situations in a very radical and dramatical way, which often leads to <<committing**T4**Spelling**None**9**commiting>> a crime. On the other hand, almost all young people have or should have special <<grown-ups**T5**Compound_word**None**9**grown ups>> to look after them and help to become a good part of society. Lack of this help leads to the stated problem of growing criminality among <<the young**T6**Adj_as_collective**None**6**youngs>>.
Thus, parents and teachers as people closest to young generation should take the situation under control. The most obvious idea to <<follow**T7**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> #DELETE#2#it is to <<pay more attention**T9**Absence_comp_colloc**None**19**give more attention>> #DELETE#11#to children to children and <<adolescents**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**9**teenagers>>. Indeed, it is known, that it is <<a common situation**T12**Articles**None**16**common situation>>#DELETE#1#, that parents are too busy earning money to get into all details of their <<child's**T14**Possessive**None**5**child>> <<life.**T15**Punctuation**None**4**life>> As for teachers, they often have too much people in class to <<devote**T16**lex_part_choice**None**4**give>> proper attention to each individual. But <<on the other hand,**T34**Punctuation**None**19**from the other side>> it is possible for both parents and teachers to cooperate and notice worrying <<tendencies**T18**Suffix**None**11**tendentions>> together. For example, <<a teacher**T21**Articles**None**7**teacher>> is able to feel changes in <<the whole behavior pattern**T17**Articles**None**22**whole behavior pattern>> of his students and <<let the parents know**T19**Verb_object_bare**None**21**give know the parents>> in case something <<is wrong**T22**Tense_form**None**5**wrong>>, and then they would take a closer look on changes in their child <<behavior**T23**Discourse**None**9**behaviour>>.
All in all, it is clear that rising crime <<commitment**T25**Spelling**None**11**committment>> rate among <<yoiung people**T24**Inappropriate_register**None**10**youngsters>> is a fact society cannot close eyes on. That is why both parents and teachers should <<pay much attention**T35**Absence_comp_colloc**None**19**give much attention>> to younger generation in order to prevent this situation to continue by giving younger people <<the support**T34**Articles**None**7**support>> they need.
