At <<first glance**T1**Articles**None**16**the first glance>>, we can clearly see that the percentage of <<transported**T2**Category_confusion**None**12**transporting>> different manufactured goods was the highest for the both transportation ways – by rail and by road. To start with, there was a huge difference between the <<proportion**T3**lex_item_choice**None**6**amount>> of machinery transported by rail, which was about 12%, and by road with only 11% in 2008. The percentage of <<transported**T4**Category_confusion**None**12**transporting>> food products and non-metallic minerals by road was actually two times <<bigger**T14**Comparative_adj**None**4**more>> than by rail – 30% and 13% versus about 11% and 7% respectively. As for the chemicals, by contrast, the transportation of this kind of products by rail was definetely <<lower than**T14**Comparative_adj**None**4**less>> it was by road – 11% and 16% respectively.
