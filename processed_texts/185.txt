Nowadays there is a <<highly**T1**Spelling**None**5**higly>> controverisal <<debate**T14**lex_item_choice**None**5**argue>> about illegal pirates that is related to downloading <<musicians**T4**Possessive**None**9**musicians>> or <<film-makers**T3**Possessive**None**11**film-makers>> products without paying for <<them**T468**Agreement_errors**None**2**it>> <<, and**T5**Punctuation**None**3**and>> this fact has led to <<an argument**T30**Category_confusion**None**5**argue>> about whether pirates should be punished or not. <<I agree**T7**Coherence**None**17**This essay agrees>> that illegal copying or sharing should be banned. Developed Internet services <<allow people to get**T8**Verb_Inf**None**16**allow people get>> almost everything they want and in most cases they can easily find this without making any payments. Every year there are thousands of incidents of illegal music sharing that has a negative impact on <<musicians**T9**Possessive**None**9**musicians>> salary. For instance, when some people <<refuse to buy**T10**Verb_Inf**None**13**refuse buying>> the original songs or albums, song writers and singers lose their <<stimulus**T11**Spelling**None**8**stimules>> to create new music because they expect mostly illegal downloading instead of legal purchasing. To prevent this, many contries have announced restrictments and punishment for pirates, and it varies from <<simply blocking**T470**Gerund_phrase**None**15**simple blocking>> pirate resources to such punishment as <<arrest**T474**Confusion_of_structures**None**14**to be arrested>>. As the biggest part of <<music makers**T12**Spelling**None**12**music-makers>> or producers suggest, #DELETE#17#pirate copies and people who share illegal products should be <<punished**T13**Spelling**None**8**panished>> in the same way as thieves. Firstly, all the things <<made originally by musicians or film producers**T15**Punctuation**None**47**made originally by musicians or film producers,>> are their intellectual <<property**T471**lex_item_choice**None**9**ownership>>. And if pirates <<allow themselves to copy**T16**Verb_Inf**None**24**allow themselves copying>> it, it means that they understand all the <<consequences**T17**Spelling**None**12**consequances>> of their decisions. However, many people nowadays, especially in developing world, cannot afford to buy special <<music**T18**Spelling**None**5**misic>> account or to pay for movie tickets, so they use illegal ways of getting songs or movies, but it leads to <<losses of**T478**Category_confusion**None**6**losing>> money <<by**T19**Prepositions**None**3**for>> original owners <<, and**T20**Punctuation**None**3**and>> so new albums and films will not be created anymore, so even such people should be punished or at least restricted from using illegal sites on the <<Internet**T21**Spelling**None**8**Internen>>. Secondly, there is a big problem of copying, especially new films. Often pirates buy only one ticket and record a movie and then share it on their sites, and so other people may not pay for watching it. To solve this problem, for example, in Russia <<there**T22**Spelling**None**5**their>> is the Anti-Pirates law that implies harsh <<punishments**T23**Spelling**None**10**punishemts>>, <<allowing putting**T24**Verb_Gerund**None**12**allowing put>> pirates in prisons. In conclusion, there is a real loss in revenues of <<musical**T25**Spelling**None**7**misical>> labels and film production companies due to actions of illegal copying, so I personally think that people who use this <<way**T26**lex_item_choice**None**4**kind>> of getting products should be <<punished**T27**Spelling**None**8**panished>> <<, and**T28**Punctuation**None**3**and>> this <<punishment**T29**Spelling**None**10**panishment>> is <<likely**T30**Spelling**None**6**lekely>> to be strict enough to prevent pirates from what they do.
