The <<graphs**T2**Spelling**None**5**graps>> illustrate maximum and minimum temperatires in Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro.There <<cities**T3**Spelling**None**6**cityes>> are different in their temperatures<< because**T5**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> they are based in <<different**T4**Spelling**None**9**differetn>> countries.
A<<As we see,**T6**Punctuation**None**9**As we see>>m<<the maximum temperature**T7**Articles**None**19**maximum temperature>>in Brazil is 30 grades in January. In Rio de Janeiro temperatures n<<do not decrease**T9**Absence_comp_colloc**None**12**not decrease>>and increase very q<<quickly**T10**Spelling**None**6**quckly>> Minimum they have in July and the number is 23. Another picture we can see in Russia. The maximum is in July and it is 25 grades. M<<The minimum**T17**Articles**None**8**Minimumn>>is in January and it is -41 grades.

In winter r<<Russians**T17**Spelling**None**8**rissians>>have - 40, but in summer 25. It is another situation in Brazil, b<<Brazilians**T17**Capitalisation**None**10**brazilians>>have warm winter and summer, temperatures are quite high and identific.
These countries are not similar and their winter and summer maximum and minimum grades are different. I think this fact will be interesting for tourists.
