The pie charts represent two ways of transportation in the area of Eastern Europe. We can see <<a big difference**T1**Articles**None**14**big difference>> between the <<proportions**T2**lex_item_choice**None**6**amount>> of some goods. <<Otherwise,**T3**Punctuation**None**9**Otherwise>> there are goods which are transported by rail and road with the same <<proportions**T4**lex_item_choice**None**5**parts>>. That is why we can permanently check, that <<metals are mostly transported by rail**T5**Standard**None**37**by rail are mostly transported metals>>. <<But in the transportation by road**T7**Punctuation**None**34**But in the transportation by road,>> metals are not so popular. <<In comparison,**T8**Punctuation**None**13**In comparison>> we can see that manufactured goods and food products are two mainly transported <<goods**T9**Noun_number**None**4**good>> by road. If we make a comparison <<between**T10**Spelling**None**6**betwee>> <<the two ways**T11**Articles**None**8**two ways>> of transportation, we will observe that <<the proportions of**T12**lex_item_choice**None**12**transporting>> machinery  by rail is <<six times bigger**T13**Numerical**None**19**bigger in six times>>. By the way, the <<amounts**T14**Noun_number**None**6**amount>> of manufactured goods are the approximately the same. Chemicals <<transported**T15**Voice**None**18**being transporting>> by rail are a little bit smaller that <<transported**T16**Voice**None**12**transporting>> by road. Non-metallic minerals do not consist <<a great part**T17**Articles**None**10**great part>> of the transportation in Eastern Europe, but they also <<tend to be**T18**lex_item_choice**None**10**keep to be>> about ten per cent.

<<In conclusion,**T19**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I would like to say that <<different options**T20**lex_item_choice**None**4**ways>> of <<the transportation of**T21**Category_confusion**None**12**transporting>> different goods help people to have them in all parts of the world.
