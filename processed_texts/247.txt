So, intellectual property and rights on it are a question of <<the highest concern**T1**Articles**None**15**highest concern>> to many governments, that have to face the modern reality and update its legislation. I think<< that**T2**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> severe punishment for such minor offence is irrelevant.
Firstly, the price of seeking these <<delinquents**T3**Spelling**None**10**deliquents>> would exceed the amount of reasonable fee for this crime. I think<< that**T4**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> every government has more important things to spend money on. Secondly, the harm from pirates is not so high – if it was, <<musicians**T5**Spelling**None**9**Misicians>>, film producers and others would simply stop producing, as their <<losses**T6**Spelling**None**7**lousses>> would exceed their incomes. I do not see this happening. Then, it is not pirates and other consumers who have to adjust. <<A supplier**T7**Articles**None**8**Supplier>> must make his product attractive and easy to use, instead of trying to fight on the battlefield with nobody but them left – let’s face the reality, no one <<uses**T8**Tense_choice**None**4**used>> discs today. <<I have neither computer with disc driver, nor TV**T9**Negation**None**55**I do not have nor computer with disc driver, neither TV>>. So how am I supposed to use these discs? Producers must meet me halfway on the <<Internet**T11**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>, creating convenient and useful on-line resources with their <<products**T12**Suffix**None**10**production>>, and I will buy <<a subscription**T13**Articles**None**12**subscription>> with a great pleasure, as I am tired of spending hours in search for a video with a proper sound and quality to <<download it**T14**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**download>> from torrents before watching any film.
<<To sum up,**T15**Punctuation**None**9**To sum up>> I would say that I do not think that sharing and copying intellectual properties on the Internet is a crime or any kind of offence, <<neither**T16**Spelling**None**7**neigher>> I think it should be controlled by the governmental structures. <<As any relations concerning purchasing the same product,**T18**Punctuation**None**55**As any relations concerning purchasing the same product>> this case must be regulated by supply – demand law. I’m sure that seeing the problem in <<a proper way**T19**Articles**None**10**proper way>> will help consumers to get what they want, producers – to earn their money and <<government**T20**Spelling**None**10**goventment>> – to not <<waste**T21**Spelling**None**5**waist>> time and resources on irrelevant things.
