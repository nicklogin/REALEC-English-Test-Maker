The charts <<provide**T1**lex_item_choice**None**10**illustrate>> <<the information**T2**Articles**None**11**information>> about the transportation of goods by rail and by road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008.

Machinery goods transported by road fell in percentage very much, <<in**T4**Prepositions**None**2**on>> 10%. As you can see from the charts, <<metals transported by road had 24%**T5**Absence_comp_sent**None**44**metals goods transported by road, but on 24%>>. Manufactured goods <<in the rail chart**T9**Prepositions**None**17**on the rail chart>> stayed the same, but manufactured goods transported by road rised slightly <<by 3%**T10**Prepositions**None**5**on 3%>>. Food products #DELETE#3#pay have <<the biggest**T12**Comparative_constr**None**6**a main>> <<increase**T13**lex_item_choice**None**4**rose>> <<by 19%**T14**Prepositions**None**6**on 19%>>. And non-metallic minerals increase too, but <<not significantly**T15**Negation**None**13**significantly>>. The <<part**T16**lex_item_choice**None**3**pay>> of chemicals #DELETE#5#goods transported by road <<rose**T18**Spelling**None**5**rised>> only <<by 5%**T19**Prepositions**None**2**5%>>. 

We can see from the #DELETE#3#pay charts that the transportation of <<such goods**T21**Absence_explanation**None**5**goods>> as food products and non-metallic minerals by road <<has more percentages**T22**Comparative_constr**None**8**are more>> than by rail. And <<there were more transportation**T24**Absence_comp_sent**None**19**more transportation>> of <<such goods**T23**Absence_explanation**None**5**goods>> as machinery and metals by rail between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008 year. The <<charts**T25**Redundant**None**10**pay charts>> show #DELETE#11#predict and logical information, because <<metals, machinery is more comfortable to transport by rail**T28**Standard**None**50**metals, machinery transorted by rail more possible>>.
