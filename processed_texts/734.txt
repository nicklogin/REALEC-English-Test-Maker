In <<the modern society**T417**Articles**None**16**a modern society>> it is usually claimed that the amount of crimes, which were <<committed**T418**lex_item_choice**None**9**permitted>> by the <<youngsters**T419**Spelling**None**8**youngers>>, rocked to a significant high. Many people <<stand on**T420**Tense_form**None**9**stands on>> the position that the lack of attention of teachers and parents causes this situation, however, there <<is**T421**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> another angle of view. In this essay several aspects of this problem and possible variants of their solutions <<will be**T422**Modals**None**8**would be>> provided.
To start with, the problem of r<<the rising amount**T423**Articles**None**13**rising amount>>of murders and robberies may be affected by the Hollywood action films. The most popular genre in the XX century includes all the aspects of dark life. Moreover, in the three quarters of them main characters are members of mafia or want to join it. Parents or teachers may try to attend kids to listen to a<<classical music**T424**Articles**None**17**a classical music>> watch ballet or participate in a chess championship, but t<<modern life**T426**Redundant_comp**None**25**the way if modern life is>>obviously c<<consists of**T425**lex_item_choice**None**14**contained from>>quiet work and does not include any physical actions, where young people could find adrenalin. As it seems to modern r<<researchers**T427**Suffix**None**10**researches>> the only variant is to show children in your own example that cruelty is not the unique variant of achieving their goals, moreover, in the most cases it leads to imprisonment or even death.
The other side of the problem is the prejudice against young people, when the attitude to them is negative without any previous foundation. Unfortunately, such an attitude causes real problems for the young people, who began to believe that they can not be good or<<or**T428**Spelling**None**3**ore>>hey do not need to be such people, because others would not believe them in any cases. Such discrimination is popular in the western countries, especially in Northern America and Europe against the black and Mexican citizens. Teachers and parents should grow tolerance in the growing generation, if people literally want to live in the next several years. Nowadays, we are standing on the border of the third World War, which is shown greatly by figures of crimes, where the young are participated.
To sum up, it should be said that this problem def<<is definitely significant and actual**T429**Abs_comp_clause**None**33**definitely significant and actual>> our modern society and every government, teacher, parent and just person should as <<try to solve it as much as he or she can**T430**Absence_explanation**None**29**as much as he can to solve it>>ecause it leads us to a really dystopia.
