It is believed that nowadays young people commit more crimes than ever before. In this essay I will present some <<causes of this problem and solutions to it**T2**Absence_explanation**None**36**causes and solutions to this problem>>.
P<<Personally**T1**Spelling**None**9**Personaly>> I agree with this statement for several reasons. Firstly, with the development of technology p<<people**T3**Spelling**None**6**peolpe>>faced such p<<a problem**T4**Articles**None**7**problem>>as harmful computer games. What I mean is that some computer games can cause a lot of harm to p<<physical**T5**Spelling**None**8**phisical>>and p<<psychological**T6**Spelling**None**13**phsicological>>state of a teenager. Playing i#DELETE#2#n cruel computer games without stopping, young people become unable to distinguish between online world and reality a<<, and**T26**Punctuation**None**3**and>>it can result in committing a crime. Secondly, nowadays parents tend to trust teenagers to c<<choose**T8**Spelling**None**5**chose>>how to spend their free time a<<, and**T23**Punctuation**None**3**and>>they also do not check with whom their child h<<keeps company**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**9**hangs out>> Such a m<<tendency**T10**lex_item_choice**None**14**modern gesture>>results in the fact that a teenager may be e<<involved**T11**Spelling**None**8**envolved>>in some criminal community.
In my opinion the problems presented be<<above**T12**lex_item_choice**None**5**below>>ay be solved easily. Firstly, the government should prohibit any kind of cruel online computer games which can cause a <<harm**T13**Countable_uncountable**None**6**a harm>>o a teenager. Secondly, parents should be more en<<involved**T14**Spelling**None**8**envolved>>n th<<their**T15**Spelling**None**5**theit>>hild's life. << so that**T24**Punctuation**None**10**. so, that>>hey would know with whom their child spends his or her free time. Also, some government projects may be presented in order to tell all people how important this problem is and that we should unite to#DELETE#8#gether in order to solve this problem.

All in all, I would like to say that if people will<<think**T20**Tense_choice**None**10**will think>>ut this problem more it w<<, it**T18**Punctuation**None**2**it>>l be real<<possible for us**T25**Absence_explanation**None**4**real>>make a difference.
