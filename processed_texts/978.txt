Social networks became extremely popular among the people of all ages due to the opportunities they give. However, <<do**T2**Agreement_errors**None**4**does>> all the people seek the same features?
According to the information <<in**T3**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the graph, they do not. We can see that while Instagram is <<dominated mostly by**T7**Standard**None**19**dominated by mostly>> <<the young**T6**Adj_as_collective**None**5**young>><< - aged 18-29 -**T4**Punctuation**None**13**, aged 18-29,>> people, <<there**T8**Spelling**None**3**the>> is not that much of a difference in <<the percentage**T9**Articles**None**10**percentage>> of Facebook and LinkedIn users between all 4 age groups. Moreover, LinkedIn is less popular among <<young people**T10**Articles**None**16**the young people>> than among <<older**T20**Articles**None**9**the elder>> ones! Perhaps, this may indicate a difference in interests of <<older**T23**Comparative_adj**None**3**old>> and <<younger**T24**Comparative_adj**None**5**young>> people?
Let's take a closer look <<at**T11**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the graph. <<In general**T1**lex_part_choice**None**10**At general>>, people of age 65+ are less active in all 3 social networks than all other age groups, but there is no big decrease in Facebook <<compared**T12**lex_item_choice**None**10**relatively>> to younger people. Such thing is true for age groups of 30 - 49 and 50 - 64 as well while we can see quite a different picture for Instagram with its strong negative correlation between age and popularity and LinkedIn where there is not that much of <<younger**T28**Comparative_adj**None**5**young>> people.
Summing <<what was said above**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**the above>>, Instagram seems to be <<orientated mostly towards**T14**Standard**None**23**oriented towards mostly>> <<younger**T27**Comparative_adj**None**5**young>> people and LinkedIn <<mostly towards**T17**Standard**None**14**towards mostly>> <<older**T25**lex_item_choice**None**5**elder>> people with Facebook being popular among all age groups and <<the most popular**T18**Superlative_adj**None**12**more popular>> in general.
