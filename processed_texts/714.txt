Our <<society**T340**Spelling**None**7**sociaty>> <<has always suffered from**T341**lex_item_choice**None**11**always have>> crime. We have a lot of books, films, diaries etc. about it. During <<all the history**T342**Articles**None**11**all history>> people <<tried**T343**Tense_choice**None**3**try>> to fight with it. We <<have innovated**T344**Tense_choice**Parallel_construction**13**had innovated>> a big and difficult <<judicial system**T346**lex_item_choice**None**23**system of the judgement>>, <<have written**T347**Tense_choice**Parallel_construction**9**had wrote>> a great <<amount of**T348**Prepositional_noun**None**6**amount>> books with laws. Nevertheless, people can not "crime" even in the modern world. Do we have at least one way to reduce <<the crime rate**T349**Absence_explanation**None**5**crime>>? Let us think about it.

Many people think the best way to in<<decrease**T350**lex_item_choice**None**8**increase>>rime is to give longer prison sentences. From my point of view, it is not a great idea. If pe<<a person**T351**Articles**None**6**person>>a<<has**T352**Tense_form**None**4**have>>ourage to do some wrong at<<actions**T353**Spelling**None**6**ations>>e\she do<<does**T354**Tense_form**None**2**do>>t. Po<<People**T355**Spelling**None**6**Poople>>ho think about crime know that they will be pu<<punished**T356**Category_confusion**None**10**punishment>>And for them there is no difference how ma<<much**T357**Spelling**None**4**mach>>ime they will spend in the prison.
I strongly bel<<believe**T358**Punctuation**None**8**believe,>>at the only fear of the death can reduce the crime. All people afr<<are afraid**T359**Abs_comp_clause**None**6**afraid>> it. If The<<a person**T361**Articles**None**10**the person>>ows that punishment for his actions is death, he will do everything to avoid it. Moreover, there wil<<will be**T362**Abs_comp_clause**None**4**will>> possibility to leave a prison earlier. It will be a magnificent "lesson" for everyone who do <<does not think**T363**Tense_form**None**12**do not think>>out rig<<the rights**T364**Articles**None**6**rights>> other peo<<people**T365**Spelling**None**6**peopel>>d laws.
Of course, a lot of people сan say that it is so cruel and we have no rights to kill people even if he or she is a killer who brought a great amount of lives. Besides, this moral scheme does not work in the real life. It is ugly, but people are animals that think only about tham<<themselves**T366**Spelling**None**10**thamselves>>o sum up, for me it is obviou<<obvious**T367**Category_confusion**None**9**obviously>>the best way to declin<<reduce**T370**lex_item_choice**None**7**decline>> <<the crime rate**T371**Absence_explanation**None**5**crime>>e fear of the death.
