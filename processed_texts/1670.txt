Nowadays, the issue of doping's exploitation in <<professional**T418**Spelling**None**12**proffecional>> sport area is becoming more and more crucial. As a matter of fact, several experts impose that sportsmen caught using forbidden drugs should not be allowed to <<take part in**T425**lex_part_choice**None**14**take part into>> competitions for a <<limited**T419**lex_item_choice**None**7**broaded>> period, while the opponents <<are of a more radical opinion**T420**lex_item_choice**None**20**feels more radically>> and claim that the sportsmen ought to be banned forever. Then, <<the two positions**T421**Articles**None**13**two positions>> will be considered and the third point will be made.
First of all, it is vital to realise that 'doping' includes not only steroids but also some medical drugs that several sport <<organisations**T422**Noun_number**None**12**organisation>> write in the documents like 'adomdomned drugs'. For instance, <<a great amount**T423**Articles**None**12**great amount>> of Russian athletes suffered from WADA’s zotoctions, because WADA decided to include meldonium <<in the list of**T424**Absence_explanation**None**4**into>> illegal medicaments. And <<not only have the champions lost**T428**Emphatic**Dependent_change**32**the champions have not only lost>> their awards and <<statuses**T427**Spelling**None**7**statues>> <<but they**T429**Absence_comp_sent**Dependent_change**3**but>> <<were also forbidden**T430**Tense_form**None**14**also forbidden>> compete professionally at all. <<Unfortunately**T432**Spelling**None**12**Unfortunatly>>, for most athelets, who <<are sometimes**T433**Standard**None**13**sometimes are>> the only bread winners in their family, it is a serious punch. Hence, the banning for a short period will be <<a sensible decision**T434**Articles**None**17**sensible decision>>.
Another point of view also has <<the right to exist**T435**Articles**None**14**right to exist>>. Sometimes, the athelete deserves to be banned for the rest of his/her life. To be more precise, several categories of athletes have tendency to cheat for every competition. Hence the only right way to tackle that problem is to exclude the sportsmen from associaton and team. On the other way, the competition risks to become the race of 'the one <<sportsman**T436**Spelling**None**9**sportsmen>>'.
Personally I think, on the one hand, the excluding sportsmen from the <<competitive**T437**Spelling**None**11**competetive>> team forever is <<too a draconian punishment**T438**Articles**None**24**too draconian punishment>>, as new changes can get into strengh rapidly and atheletes and their teams noy a problem with doping test just because a medical drug which used to be obvious for all atheletes became illegal though on several months. On the other hand, the results of the competitions should not be addictive by drugs. That is why some dishonest sportsmen caught exploiting doping, probably will be caught twice or even more. In most <<cases**T440**Noun_number**None**4**case>> <<a severe sanction**T441**Articles**None**18**the sever sanction>> is permitted.
Summarising all the points, unfortunately, professional <<sport**T442**Spelling**None**6**sports>> tends to be the race of equipment more that rivalry between <<humans**T444**Noun_number**None**5**human>>. <<-**T443**Redundant_comp**None**64**It would be great if Olympic games and other sport’s competition>>.
