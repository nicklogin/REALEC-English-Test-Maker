Nowadays it can be clearly seen <<that**T1**Spelling**None**4**than>> <<the situation**T27**Articles**None**9**situation>> among <<young people**T4**Articles**None**16**the young people>> <<having committed**T5**Voice**None**9**committed>> <<a crime**T6**Articles**None**5**crime>> <<has changed**T2**Tense_choice**None**7**changed>> dramatically <<, and**T28**Punctuation**None**3**and>> it <<has become**T3**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> a very <<serious**T29**lex_item_choice**None**5**daily>> problem. More adolescents <<become**T7**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> thieves or even <<murderers**T30**Derivation**None**7**murders>> and it cannot but <<distress**T31**lex_item_choice**None**6**grieve>>.As for me, a lot of my schoolmates are in prison now or have previous convictions. In this essay I would like to introduce this problem, discuss different <<reasons for**T32**Prepositional_noun**None**10**reasons of>> it and give some possible solutions.
In our time adults do not care a<<much**T33**Quantifiers**None**5**a lot>>about their children. Teenagers have free access to the i<<Internet**T9**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> they entertain themselves in different ways w<<, which**T8**Punctuation**None**5**which>>are not always safe or lawful. Because of it m<<most  teenagers**T34**Numerals**None**17**most of teenagers>>c<<come to the conclusion**T35**lex_item_choice**None**8**consider>>that everything is available f<<to**T36**Prepositional_adjective**None**3**for>>them and do not care much about future consequences. They begin to steal food from supermarkets, b<<bully**T37**Derivation**None**4**bull>>and beat their classmates in order to t<<get**T38**lex_item_choice**None**4**take>>their money, jump f<<off**T39**Prepositions**None**4**from>>t<<trains**T24**Articles**None**10**the trains>>and do a<<many**T40**Quantifiers**None**3**any>>other dangerous and indecent things. Most of them a<<do**T10**Word_choice**None**13**are trying to>>that in order to attract their parents' attention. As a solution, I would like to suggest p<<that parents be**T41**that_subj_clause**Parallel_construction**13**parents to be>>more attentive to their child, t<<speak**T42**that_subj_clause**Parallel_construction**8**to speak>>more, t<<discuss**T43**that_subj_clause**Parallel_construction**10**to discuss>>their daily problems. It could really help t<<teenagers**T45**Noun_number**None**8**teenager>>not to f<<feel**T44**Redundant**None**16**feel him/herself>>a<<abandoned**T25**Category_confusion**None**8**abandone>>and alone. Moreover, t<<access**T46**Articles**None**10**the access>>to i<<the Internet**T56**Articles**None**8**Internet>>and other sources i<<where**T13**Conjunctions**None**8**in which>>c<<a child**T14**Articles**None**5**child>>could see violence should not be free.Parents should limit it in s<<a soft way**T15**Articles**None**8**soft way>>and t<<give**T16**Lack_par_constr**None**7**to give>>their children e<<an explanation**T17**Articles**None**11**explanation>>of their a<<actions**T19**Noun_number**None**6**action>>
Another important issue is that nowadays crime be<<has become**T20**Tense_choice**None**6**became>>opular and even encouraged by social media. Every day teenagers watch different TV<<TV shows**T26**Spelling**None**8**TV-shows>>movies, play games co<<showing**T18**lex_item_choice**None**12**consisted of>>iolence.They take it as an<<a model**T47**lex_item_choice**None**10**an example>>o follow and begin to repeat actions th<<they**T21**Spelling**None**3**the>>aw. As a solution I would like to offer social networks and social media at all to restrict their materials and their content, not to allow to public materials which in<<glorify**T50**lex_item_choice**None**7**include>>rime. Children should see only good examples on the screen to br<<follow**T51**lex_item_choice**None**19**bring it to reality>>Fo<<For example,**T22**Punctuation**None**11**For example>>h<<more programmes about sport or healthy way life, stories of different successful people and people whose lives were ruined because of their criminal past should be introduced**T52**Voice**None**174**they could introduce more programmes about sport or healthy way life, stories of different successful people and people whose lives were ruined because of their criminal past>>To sum up, I would like to say that crime can really ruin and spoil our society. However, more and more teenagers are<<become**T23**Tense_choice**None**12**are becoming>>volved in it.<<crime**T55**Ref_device**None**2**it>>hose young people are our future and that is why we should not let them become criminals.Howbeit, it should be done in a nic<<helpful**T56**lex_item_choice**None**4**nice>>nner in order not to be too strict but understanding and supporting.
