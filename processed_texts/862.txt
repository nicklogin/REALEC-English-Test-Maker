Nowadays <<there are**T1**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**there>> a lot of problems and one of <<these problems**T2**suggestion**None**12**this problem>> is crime. <<Unfortunatelly**T3**Spelling**None**12**Unfortunetly>>, most of the crimes are committed by the people of the young age. In this essay, <<i**T60**Capitalisation**None**1**i>> will describe several causes and solutions <<to**T4**Prepositions**None**2**of>> this problem.
D<<This problem can be caused by different reasons**T5**suggestion**None**50**Different causes can be the reason of this problem>> But one of the most i<<serious**T6**lex_item_choice**None**9**important>>p<<problems**T61**suggestion**None**7**problem>>is bad parenting. It is very common that parents don't g<<pay**T8**lex_item_choice**None**4**give>>enough attention to their child. They a#DELETE#3#re also don't know how to c<<communicate**T10**Spelling**None**10**comunicate>>and teach h<<him**T7**Ref_device**None**3**him>> This child can't get what h<<he**T11**Ref_device**None**2**he>>wants a<<how to do it**T13**Redundant_comp**None**21**and don't know how to>> b<<because**T14**Spelling**None**7**beacuse>>h<<the parents**T12**suggestion**None**11**his parents>>d<<haven't taught**T15**Tense_choice**None**11**don't teach>>h<<him**T62**Ref_device**None**3**him>> A<<As a result**T16**Linking_device**None**10**After that>> this child t<<will be trying**T17**Tense_form**None**6**trying>>to get something that h<<he or she**T63**Ref_device**None**2**he>>wants by stealing it. Another c<<cause**T18**Spelling**None**5**casue>>if<<of**T19**Spelling**None**1**f>>this problem is bad company. Sometimes children think that bad companies are cool and that they are the best, and t<<children**T22**Ref_device**None**4**they>>a<<try**T20**Tense_choice**None**10**are trying>>t<<to become friends with them**T21**Word_choice**None**43**to communicate with them and become friends>> Bad companies teach them how to do bad things, such as stealing, d<<drinking**T27**Spelling**None**9**dreanking>>a#DELETE#3#nd e<<, etc**T25**Punctuation**None**3**etc>> And children want to look like others in bad companies a<<, and**T30**Punctuation**None**3**and>>they a<<start**T31**Tense_choice**None**12**are starting>>to r<<imitate**T32**lex_item_choice**None**12**repeat after>>them.
The first solution to this problem is to start to co<<communicate**T33**Spelling**None**10**comunicate>>ith your child. Parents and teachers can teach th<<children**T35**Ref_device**None**4**them>><< that**T26**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>e<<by committing crimes**T36**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**by crimes>>#DELETE#1#they ca<<won't achieve**T34**Tense_choice**None**13**can't achieve>>i<<an appropriate status**T64**suggestion**None**18**appropriate status>>n the world. Teachers can include special classes, where they ca<<will show**T40**Tense_choice**None**8**can show>>nd teach children that crimes have a bad influence to<<on**T41**Prepositions**None**2**to>>heir future.Parents can show and te<<teach them**T44**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**teach>>ow to ch<<choose**T42**Spelling**None**5**chose>> good company. Another solution is to communicate with friends of your child. Parents can try to kn<<get to know**T47**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**know>>riends of their child, so<<so that**T38**Linking_device**None**2**so>>hey will know what they are doing and who th<<those friends**T45**Ref_device**None**4**they>>re. And if th<<there is**T50**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**there>> bad company, they ca<<should**T52**Modals**None**3**can>>ry to in<<stop**T51**lex_item_choice**None**9**interrupt>>h<<this friendship**T39**suggestion**None**16**their friendship>>Overall, thi<<the problem of teenagers' crimes**T55**Absence_explanation**None**12**this problem>> very serious in our world and<<, and**T56**Punctuation**None**3**and>> can take a lot of time to get<<solve**T43**lex_item_choice**None**11**get rid off>>.
