The graph from the picture indicates the percentage of people from different age groups who use three social networks.
First of all, we can notice that Facebook is the most popular cosial network. In contrast, auditory of LinkedIn is much lower. Also, we can see that Facebook and Instagram are more attractive for young generation. At the same time, percentage of young people who use linkedIn is smaller than the similar numbers from other companies. Another interesting fact is that the percentage of people who use Facebook is becoming higher from the eldest group to the youngest group. In contrast, percentages of linkedIn are weaker correlated with age of users. And Finally, shares of Instagram users in every age group are plummeted from the 53% to 25% when we compare different groups of people.
let's talk about similarities. Firstly, Instagram and Facebook have the equal trend that companies are more popular for young people. Another similar trait is LinkedIn has a practicially same level of people from 30-49 age group with Instagram.
