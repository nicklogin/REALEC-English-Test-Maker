<<Nowadays**T27**Spelling**None**7**Nowdays>> the society is convinced that using drugs by <<sportsmen**T28**Noun_number**None**10**sportsmens>> should be <<punished**T29**Spelling**None**8**panished>>. Some think that these athletes should be banned for a limited period. However, <<others believe these sportsmen**T30**Ref_device**None**19**others believe they>> deserve to be banned for the rest of their lives. The essay will discuss both points of <<view**T31**Noun_number**None**5**views>>.
I strongly believe that everyone can make a mistake, so the athletes who use illegal drugs should be <<punished**T22**Spelling**None**8**panished>> for a limited period. <<After their banned period,**T32**Punctuation**None**25**After their banned period>> they should have a chance to take all medical tests. <<If they pass their tests,**T23**Punctuation**None**22**If they pass the tests>> they will have an opportunity to <<compete**T24**Derivation**None**9**competite>>. Some people can argue, because the impact of the strongest drugs is not <<studied**T19**Category_confusion**None**5**study>> <<well; therefore,**T25**Punctuation**None**15**well, therefore>> <<those athletes**T26**Determiners**None**12**the athletes>> can <<impart**T20**Word_choice**None**6**change>> their health for the rest of the life. In that case, the government should state <<additional tests**T17**Articles**None**19**an additional tests>> for <<those**T21**Pronouns**None**5**these>> athletes, which will provide the information about all aspects of health, physical and mental conditions of <<those sportsmen**T3**Determiners**None**9**sportsmen>>.
Moreover, <<if**T13**Spelling**None**2**it>> the professional athletes did not use illegal drugs, the sport would not be so interesting. <<Sportsmen**T15**Articles**None**13**The sportsmen>> overcome human limits only by using drugs.
On the other hand, when <<athletes**T10**Noun_number**None**12**the athletes>> take steroids, they show a bad example for the young generation. Teenagers start thinking they will not achieve <<their goals**T7**Articles**None**9**the goals>> in <<professional sports**T8**Articles**None**23**the professional sports>> without drugs. It leads them to not work hard, but use <<drugs**T6**Articles**None**9**the drugs>> to become ordinary athletes. <<For these reasons,**T12**Punctuation**None**17**For these reasons>> <<sportsmen**T4**Noun_number**None**10**sportsmens>> using <<drugs**T5**Articles**None**9**the drugs>> should be banned for the rest of <<their life**T11**Articles**None**8**the life>>.
To conclude, the government should ban the athletes for only a limited period. <<However,**T2**Punctuation**None**7**However>> some <<sportsmen**T3**Noun_number**None**10**sportsmens>> should be banned forever if they are popular and have a strong and deep influence on the young athletes.
