Nowadays pirate copies make musicians and film producers lose a lot of money. Should people who copy and share music or films on the internet be punished?

<<Of course,**T1**Punctuation**None**9**Of course>> people who work in music or film industry get <<huge amounts**T2**Noun_number**None**13**a huge amount>> of money from selling their production. But no one exept them <<will not**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**5**wonâ€™t>> feel bad if copying and sharing music or films <<becomes**T4**Agreement_errors**None**6**become>> legal. In my opinion, the government should allow pirate files <<on the Internet**T6**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>> as there are many people who cannot buy <<original discs**T7**Articles**None**18**the original discs>> and use Internet to listen to music or to watch <<films**T8**Noun_number**None**4**film>>.

On the other hand, musicians can make money on concerts and producers can have money from selling merchandise. Despite the fact that there are <<a lot of**T9**lex_item_choice**None**17**a large number of>> pirate copies, I think that it is not a <<big**T10**lex_item_choice**None**5**large>> problem, because a lot of people still go to <<cinemas**T11**Noun_number**None**6**cinema>> and buy CD discs. For example, the sites like Kinopoisk.ru show that a lot of people prefer to go to the cinema instead of watching film at home. <<So,**T12**Punctuation**None**2**So>> producers <<get**T13**Tense_choice**None**3**got>> their money back. <<Of course,**T14**Punctuation**None**9**Of course>> <<if pirate system did not exist,**T17**Punctuation**None**29**if pirate system did not exis>>t they <<coud**T18**Conditionals**None**3**can>> earn much more <<, but**T19**Punctuation**None**3**but>> I consider that they have enough money. <<The same situation is**T20**Absence_comp_sent**None**18**The same situation>> with musicians. For instanse, <<a famous Russian singer**T22**Determiners**None**25**the famous Russian singer>> Shnurov takes for the ticket to his concert at least 3 <<thousands**T23**Spelling**None**10**thouthands>> <<rubbles**T24**Spelling**None**6**rubles>>. He always <<has**T25**lex_item_choice**None**8**connects>> a lot of people <<in lagre stadiums**T26**Prepositions**None**17**at large stadiums>>. <<So,**T27**Punctuation**None**2**So>> I am sure that he is not against <<pirate copies**T28**Articles**None**17**the pirate copies>> of his music <<on the Internet**T30**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>>. 

<<In conclusion,**T31**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I want to write that I <<strongly believe**T32**Tense_form**None**19**am strongly believe>> that people who download pirate files should not be punished as musicians and producers can get money from other parts of their <<work**T33**lex_item_choice**None**10**production>>. And <<we should remember**T34**Absence_comp_sent**None**15**should remember>> that many people from all over the world still <<go to**T35**lex_item_choice**None**3**use>> the cinema and like to <<listen to**T36**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> music on discs.
