Nowdays more crimes are being comitted by young people than ever before. And this is a huge problem as current young generation is the generation which will set the motion of the nation in a few years. How can a man who stole a snack from a shop become a fair politician? This question makes us think about the crimes committed by young generation. To tackle this problem, we need to find the reasons why do children commit crimes and then to find the ways parents and teachers can affect these reasons.
From my point of view, there are 2 main reasons for crimes committed by young people. The first reason is the distance between a child and his parents. Adults pay a lot of attention to their career and they do not allocate much time for their kids and do not teach them about good things and bad things. The second reason is that kids spend a lot of time surfing the web and sometimes they may visit websites with bad content which put positive spin on crimes, and incentivize them commit crimes.
To solve the problem of crime, we need to focus on these 2 reasons and take 2 simple steps. As a first step should spend more time with their kids and to them about good things and tell bad things. Besides parents, teachers should do the same at schools. As a second step, parents should protect kids from bad information in the internet by installing special programs on the laptops. These actions will protect kids from bad incentives to comit crimes and will help them understand what a crime is.
We found out 2 reasons for kids crime: bad information on the web + lack of understanding good and bad things. To tackle the problem of kids crime, we need to control their internet surfing and allocate more time to them.
By taking 2 steps described above, we could prevent kids from comiting crimes.
