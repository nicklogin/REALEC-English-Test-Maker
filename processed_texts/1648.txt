In our days, we can see the big level of using illegal drugs in sport. International Sport Federation became a war with that, but people have a different opinions about banning of sportsmen. Some people strongly believed that athlets, who used illegal drugs, should be banned for the period of 2 years. They think about limited period. However, others think that Sport Federation must ban them for the rest of their lives.
Supportes of the first opinion tell that we need to give for a sportsman a chance for a new life without illegal drugs. Moreover, in theory, person who know that he was banned, but society remember his old wins and believe him, he may be to not use drugs again. It is not guaranteed, but we will have a chance, that criminal will not be continue. in future.
On the other hand, opponent of this view do not agree with these arguements. They think that person, who did crime in last time, would do it again. It makes conclusion: we need to protect sport from these sportsmans: that is why they must be banned for the rest of their lives.
As for me, I agree with arguements of the first party of conflict. Firstly, every person has a right on a second chance after crime. In spite of the fact of a serious crime, nobody can get a future career, wins and success of other person - if this crimer will be a good sportsman without drugs, he can take part in international competitions, when he wants it.
Taking everything into accaunt, I can conclude, that <<athletes**T341**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> should be banned for a limited period, because ban for all life can get from person <<success**T342**Spelling**None**7**suceess>> and his favourite profession on all life - <<none**T343**Spelling**None**5**noone>> can do it.
