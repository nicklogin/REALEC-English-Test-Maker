The graphs #DELETE#5#below show the population <<size**T18**Noun_attribute**None**6**size’s>> changes in the USA. We can also see birth rate and death rate. According to the graphs, these processes are closely connected.
F#DELETE#24#rom the very beginning, w<<We**T5**Capitalisation**Dependent_change**2**we>>can see that from 1750 to 1800 the number of people in the USA was quite stable.
