Nowadays doping in sport is more widespread than ever. Some people believe that <<those sportsmen**T16**Determiners**None**14**such sportsmen>> who were caught using illegal drugs should be banned from official competitions <<temporarily**T17**Spelling**None**10**temporarly>>. For example, two years. Others claim that these <<athletes**T18**Spelling**None**8**athelets>> <<must not**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**7**mustn't>> take part in any competitions <<ever**T19**Category_confusion**None**7**forever>>. As for <<me**T2**lex_part_choice**None**6**myself>>, I would support the first opinion. Firstly, these <<athletes**T20**Spelling**None**8**athelets>> who were caught using <<drugs**T21**lex_item_choice**None**6**doping>> are not only banned from competing proffesionally but also shamed by society a lot. So they are practically <<penalised**T22**Spelling**None**9**penylized>> twice. To my mind, <<it is**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it's>> enough to prevent further attempts. Secondly<<,**T4**Punctuation**None**1**.>> sometimes sportsmen <<do not**T5**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don't>> even know that they are using forbidden <<supplements**T6**lex_item_choice**None**8**sypplies>>. That was <<a part**T24**Articles**None**8**the part>> of the doping scandal with <<Russian**T25**Capitalisation**None**7**russian>> <<athletes**T26**Spelling**None**8**athelets>> last summer, some of them <<did not**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn't>> even know about it. So why should we ban them for the rest of their lives? On the other hand, I can understand people who believe that if sportsmen <<have**T8**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> done it on purpose they should be banned for the rest of their lives. They've done it so they don't care about rules and other important things in the world of sport competitions. Moreover, there are some <<athletes**T27**Spelling**None**8**athelets>> who have been caught twice or more times. I think#DELETE#1#, such people <<should never**T9**Negation**None**9**shouldn't>> take part in any <<competition**T10**Spelling**None**12**competitione>> #DELETE#4#Ever again#DELETE#1#, because they <<do not**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don't>> <<respect**T28**lex_item_choice**None**6**admire>> the rules<< that**T14**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they have to obey. To sum up, I would like to say that if <<a sports person**T34**lex_item_choice**None**13**the sportsman>> <<has made**T31**Tense_choice**None**4**made>> a mistake <<just once**T15**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**once>> <<he**T32**Ref_device**None**2**he>> <<deserves**T34**Tense**None**8**deserved>> to be forgiven.
