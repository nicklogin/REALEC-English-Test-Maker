There is a burning issue regarding usage of illegal drugs by <<athletes**T5**Articles**None**12**the athletes>>. Some people think that sportsmen that use drugs should not be able to compete in professional sport for a few years, while others think that <<such sportsmen**T18**Ref_device**None**4**they>> should be banned from competing for good. I will try to discuss both views and express my own opinion.
<<On the one hand,**T17**Punctuation**None**15**On the one hand>> <<athletes**T7**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> that <<are using**T8**Tense_form**None**5**using>> illegal drugs are frauds. By using medicine that can help you to gain weight, <<become stronger,**T9**Punctuation**None**15**become stronger>> sportsmen prevent their teammates from getting good results and achievements. Banning such people from <<sports**T13**Noun_number**None**5**sport>> for a limited period, <<accompanied**T10**Punctuation**None**10**acompanied>> with public <<judgement**T15**Spelling**None**8**judgment>>, can be very effective in preventing further incidents.
On the other hand, there are few precedents <<with a known history**T14**Prepositions**None**18**known to a history>> of using illegal drugs not once but regularly. Those sportsmen that do not respect not just other athletes, but coaches, some legendary figures, fans or the whole country that will suffer from judgement and humiliation do not deserve to present their nation <<in competitions**T19**Prepositions**None**14**on competitons>> for the rest of their lives. These will also be a good example for those who think about starting using drugs: your stupidity can end <<your career and the whole life**T11**Punctuation**None**31**your career, and the whole life>>.
In my opinion, using illegal medicine is definitely a problem nowadays. But there are few points I would like to underline. Firstly, some athletes are in need of some medicine to reduce pain, for example, but a lot of drugs <<like that**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**that>> contain illegal components. Such athletes' <<causes**T12**Spelling**None**5**casss>> should be <<double**T3**Spelling**None**5**doubl>>-checked before making statements. Secondly, sportsmen that have been already <<caught**T1**Spelling**None**5**caugh>> should be checked more often.
To conclude, such serious problem can be fixed not necessary by banning and ruining career of good sportsmen but through <<a serious investigation**T17**Articles**None**21**serious investigation>> and testing that will help to prevent such things.
