Nowadays crimes are the part of our everyday life, we can face it wherever. Especially, there are more and more young people, who are involved in different crimes. It can be due to vary reasons.
From my point of view, it can be caused by living in poverty and in bad housing conditions, young people s<<start stealing**T16**Gerund_phrase**None**14**start to steal>>a little bit from shops and then do it more and more often, because they want to eat or buy something that they need, but d<<do not have much money**T2**Absence_comp_sent**None**17**do not much money>>to buy it themselves. Another reason can be misunderstanding of the consequences, they are young and have no idea about jail at all, for example. They c<<sometimes commit crimes with their friends just for fun**T5**Standard**None**55**commit crimes sometimes just for fun with their friends>>and do not think about t<<consequences**T6**Articles**None**15**the consequents>>
