Crimes as robbery, <<pickpocketing**T19**Compound_word**None**14**pick-pocketing>> and burglary become the highly discussed topic in the modern society. The statistic shows that part of them are <<committed**T20**Tense_form**None**8**commited>> by youngsters and the figures are growing. Something have to be done about that by parents and schools so that <<young people**T21**Articles**None**16**the young people>> would overcome such problem.
