Nowadays more crimes are being committed by youngsters. In this essay some problems which are related to the issue of violence actions amoug teenagers and a vailable solution will be disscused.

It is claimed that young people have too much free time now. Deffinately, this fact can explane why the rate of violent actions increases. While one group of teenagers have their additional classes of school studies or sport courses, others have nothing to do than use their smartphones and surf at those sites that are forbiden where they can easily learn how to kill. For example, in Russia in last two years a lavel of violence actions and deaths among teenagers has riched its peack: more than 50 percent of people at the age from 15 to 20 were involved in crime and even died.

Actualy, the reason why it is happening is the lack of attention from parents. When a child grows up in a loving family, with normal relationships and ideals, he would never commit a crime. It is neccesary to emphasise, that the government should pay attention on this problem. For instance, additional classes could be made obligatory, some hobby courses could be free for families with no enough income. It could lead not only to a more broad minded generation, but also it could decrease a number of crime actions that are committed by young people.

To summurise everything have been said, some real, forsed and strong actions should be taken. Families should be more attentive to their children and they should try to organise children's spear time in such a way when they would not have time for stupid and violent things.
