The charts below represent data about the transportation of goods by rail and road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008. The first <<pie chart**T1**Absence_explanation**None**3**pie>> shows <<the information about the transportation**T17**Articles**None**14**transportation>> by rail, and <<the second one - by road**T4**Punctuation**None**22**the second one by road>>.

To start with, metals are the most transported good by rail, while by road the most transported are food products. It is obvious that <<the transportation**T5**Articles**None**14**transportation>> of manufactured goods is nearly the same by both of these means, 12% of machinery is transported by rail, and only 2% by road. The most striking fact is that <<the less transported goods**T6**Articles**None**22**less transported goods>> by rail are non-metallic minerals and <<machinery is the less transported good by road**T7**Absence_comp_sent**None**17**machinery by road>>. What is more, it <<can be**T8**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> seen, that the amount of transported chemicals <<is**T9**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> also <<close to**T10**Prepositions**None**8**close as>> manufactured goods.

To sum up, I would like to say that the most transported good are <<manufactured goods**T17**Category_confusion**None**11**manufactury>> (53%). The <<percentages**T13**Noun_number**None**10**percentage>> of transported food products and metals <<are**T14**Spelling**None**1**a>> very close. <<Furthermore,**T17**Punctuation**None**9**Futhemore>> on the bottom of the <<charts**T17**Noun_number**None**5**chart>> are machinery goods and non-metallic minerals.
