Nowadays people have <<several**T44**lex_item_choice**None**3**two>> opinions about <<convicts**T59**lex_item_choice**None**14**the prisoniers>> and about people who <<commit**T2**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> crimes. <<These opinions**T45**Ref_device**None**4**They>> <<separate**T59**Spelling**None**9**separetes>> in two groups. One group thinks that the best way to reduce <<crime**T5**Noun_number**None**6**crimes>> is to give long prison sentences.Another group thinks that <<criminals**T13**Ref_device**None**4**they>> <<will get**T59**lex_item_choice**None**6**become>> better if they <<receive**T16**lex_item_choice**None**9**are given>> alternative methods of <<punishment for crime**T15**lex_item_choice**None**14**reducing crime>>.
The first method can be effective, but it does not give us the g<<guarantee**T17**Spelling**None**8**garantie>>o<<that criminals will change**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**of their changes>> They can h<<serve**T28**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>>a long prison sentence, be in prison, m<<work hard there**T19**lex_item_choice**None**28**make there works, hard works>>and after that, for example,after 25 years, they will not realise what they have done b<<wrong**T20**lex_item_choice**None**3**bad>> for them it can be o<<just**T46**lex_item_choice**None**4**only>>a crime and they can d<<commit**T21**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>>it one more time. Also, I do not want to say that all people b<<behave**T30**Pronouns**None**17**behave themselves>>a<<the same way**T29**Prepositions**None**15**at the same way>> After a long prison t<<sentence,**T59**Punctuation**None**8**sentence>>they can b<<get**T31**lex_item_choice**None**2**be>>better, because they w<<will want**T34**Tense_choice**None**4**want>>to forget that bad t<<experience**T24**lex_item_choice**None**4**time>>and live a new life.
Others think about al<<alternative**T12**Spelling**None**11**alternrtive>>ethods. Yes, it can be effective, th<<criminals**T25**Ref_device**None**4**they>>an realize what they have done, but th<<if they do not serve a prison sentence for committing a murder**T40**Standard**Dependent_change**77**they can think if they committing a murder and do not serve a prison sentence>>th<<they may think that they will not be punished for killing someone else in the future**T35**Modals**None**58**they will can kill another person and will not be punished>>The same situation wi<<about**T61**Prepositions**None**4**with>>hanges ca<<may**T62**Modals**None**3**can>>e<<occur**T60**lex_item_choice**None**2**be>>nd in<<then**T63**Linking_device**None**22**in this sutuation when>>he prisoner ha<<serves**T42**lex_item_choice**None**3**has>>n al<<alternative**T47**Spelling**None**11**alternitive>>unishment and af<<after that**T65**Redundant_comp**None**32**after that way of reducing crime>>hey can be more li<<friendly**T68**lex_item_choice**None**12**lifefriendly>>nd wa<<willing**T66**Participial_constr**None**4**want>>o fo<<forget about**T67**Prepositions**None**6**forget>>ll this ti<<experience**T64**lex_item_choice**None**4**time>>In my opinion, I think that bet<<a better way**T50**Articles**None**10**better way>> reduce the<<crime**T59**Articles**None**10**the crimes>> to give longer prison sentenses. For me, Kil<<killer**T8**Capitalisation**Parallel_construction**6**Killer>>ho<<who**T11**Capitalisation**None**3**Who>>l<<murdered**T51**lex_item_choice**Parallel_construction**6**killed>>lot of people, must be in a p<<prison**T7**Articles**None**8**a prison>>ecause I do not want tha<<that one to be among us**T9**Redundant_comp**None**31**that one of them to be among us>>t is dangerous for people.
