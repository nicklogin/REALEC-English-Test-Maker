The graph shows the distribution of using popular social network in the USA by different age groups.
Facebook is the most popular social network: its percentage use is higher than of two other services for each age groups. More than half of Americans use it, and its popularity is higher in younger groups - the percentage use decreases monotonically from "18-29" group to "65+" one.
The distribution of Instagram's popularity is correlated with Facebook: we see the same trend of its descension with respect to age. However, its absolute parameter of popularity is lower than Facebook's one - it is approximately 1.5 times less for young people and more than 2 times for three elder groups.
What differs LinkedIn distribution from previous ones is that its popularity among people aged 30-49 and 50-64 is higher than among young people (18-29). It can be certainly asserted than LinkedIn is less popular than Facebook; however, it cannot be compared with Instagram's popularity in terms of absolute values, but the fact is that more people aged 30+ use LinkedIn than Instagram.
The main point is that Facebook is the most popular social network, but Instagram and LinkedIn are used by different age groups with different percentage.
