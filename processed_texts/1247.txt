The pie chart illustrates the ways of delivering goods in Eastern Europe during 2008, by rail and road. The largest proportion of goods delivery comprised  manufactured goods for both types of transport. However, the percentage of the delivering of metal goods by rail was significantly higher than by road, while road infrastructure delivered the higher share of food products than <<the rail transport**T1**Articles**None**14**rail transport>> system. 

As it is evident from the pie chart, the largest proportion of good’s transportation by both modes of <<vehicles**T2**Noun_number**None**7**vehicle>> <<include**T3**Tense_choice**None**8**included>> manufactured goods, with 25% of delivering by rail and 28% by road. The second noticeable trend was that the percentage of metals <<transported**T4**Category_confusion**None**14**transportation>> by rail (35%) was considerably higher than the proportion of <<delivered**T5**Category_confusion**None**10**delivering>> metals by road (11%). Moreover, the share of food production’s delivery by road was nearly three times as big as <<the transportation**T6**Articles**None**14**transportation>> of food products by rail. 

As it can be seen from the chart, the <<percentages**T7**Noun_number**None**10**percentage>> of transportation of machinery and chemicals <<were not**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**6**wasn’t>> significant for both ways of delivering. 

To sum up, the percentage of <<the transportations**T13**Noun_number**None**14**transportation>> of food production, metals and manufactured goods <<comprised**T12**Spelling**None**7**comised>> two third of <<the total delivering share**T13**Articles**None**22**total delivering share>> by both modes of vehicle.
