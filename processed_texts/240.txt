The graph illustrates <<the differences**T1**Articles**None**11**differences>> <<between**T2**Prepositions**None**5**among>> unemployment <<indexes**T3**Spelling**None**9**indexcies>> in <<a variety**T4**Determiners**None**7**variety>> of world parts from the sample in the period of 2014 and 2015 years.
It is clear from the chart that such world regions as North Africa and South Asia <<had**T11**Tense_choice**None**4**have>> equal rates in 2014 and 2015 years. <<However,**T5**Punctuation**None**7**However>> <<these**T6**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> figures <<were**T10**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> much more higher in N. Africa, reaching <<12,5%**T7**Absence_explanation**None**4**12,5>>. It <<was**T9**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> the most enormous rate in this sample. On the contrast, <<the Middle East**T8**Articles**None**11**Middle East>> and Latin America <<were characterized**T30**Tense_choice**None**12**characterize>> with more <<unemployed**T14**Category_confusion**None**12**unemployment>> people in 2014 than in 2015. Meanwhile <<the EU**T15**Articles**None**2**EU>> <<had**T16**Tense_choice**None**3**has>> another trend that <<changed**T17**Tense_choice**None**7**changes>> the conclusive results of the research. <<The unemployment rate was higher by 1,4%**T20**Standard**None**41**The unemployment rate by 0,4 % was higher>> in 2015 than in 2014. As a result, the opposite outcomes of sampleâ€™s constituents <<had influenced**T23**Tense_choice**None**9**influence>> <<the worldwide index**T24**Articles**None**15**worldwide index>>: in 2015 it <<doubled**T25**Tense_choice**None**7**doubles>> the index in 2014, <<which**T26**Spelling**None**4**wich>> <<remained**T27**Tense_choice**None**7**remains>> at the level of 5,9%.
Overall, it is not argued<< that**T28**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<the worldwide rate**T29**Articles**None**14**worldwide rate>> of unemployment did not changed in researching period because of fluctuating <<dynamics**T30**Category_confusion**None**7**dynamic>> of each part of the sample. It means that worldwide index does not provide us with truthful information about every region.
