Today professional sportsmen tend to boost their results with the help of forbidden substances. It is argued that contestants that were proven to <<have consumed**T1**Tense_choice**None**7**consume>> illegal drugs should not ever be allowed to participate in <<competitions**T2**Noun_number**None**11**competition>> <<, while**T3**Conjunctions**None**5**while>> another point of view suggests that penalty shouldn't be so strict and should last only several years. This essay will overview both opinions and make a conclusion.
Some people believe that sportsmen that were caught cheating once would continue to use steroids and other means of increasing their physical <<abilities**T4**lex_item_choice**None**13**possibilities>> even after <<a few years**T6**Articles**None**9**few years>> of disqualification. Sadly, <<the sports industry**T29**Articles**None**15**sports industry>> has <<known**T7**Tense_form**None**4**know>> such cases. First places at professional competitions bring loads of money, and that is the reason why <<athletes**T8**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> continue to commit crimes. Banning unfair <<players**T27**lex_item_choice**None**5**stars>> could open a way <<for**T9**Prepositions**None**2**to>> young and ambitious people who could be more interested in honest competition.
The opposite argument is that disqualification shouldn't be permanent. Certainly, cheating is a serious crime but does <<it**T10**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> really <<deserve**T11**Tense_form**None**8**deserves>> such punishment? Professional <<athletes**T12**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> put all their lives to achieve success, and all their aspirations are connected with <<sports**T20**Category_confusion**None**5**sport>> triumphs. They often can't do anything else <<except for**T13**Prepositions**None**6**except>> their profession, so leaving a career forever might mean an end to all their perspectives. The other point is that any <<separate**T14**Spelling**None**8**separete>> disqualifications. <<No matter how long they are they don't solve the whole problem**T16**Absence_comp_sent**None**57**No matter how long they are don't solve the whole problem>> of illegal <<drug**T17**Noun_number**None**5**drugs>> use. Much more serious <<steps**T18**Spelling**None**5**sleps>> <<should**T19**Spelling**None**5**shoud>> be taken to cope with such issue, the whole system should be overlooked and reformed.
To sum up, <<drug**T21**Noun_number**None**5**drugs>> use in sport remains a serious problem. <<A life-long**T25**Capitalisation**None**9**life-long>> penalty has some minor benefits but it doesn't change the whole situation. Neither does <<a short ban**T24**Articles**None**9**short ban>> for two years <<, although**T26**Punctuation**None**8**although>> <<a permanent ban**T25**Articles**None**13**permanent ban>> could keep more competitors from unfair game.
