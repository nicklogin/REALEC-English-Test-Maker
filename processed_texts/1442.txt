Nowadays people have many gadgets. We have a telephone, laptop, notebook, personal computer <<, special glasses**T1**Punctuation**None**15**special glasses>>, iwatch and so on. And every gadget has an influence on our health.

Firstly, gadgets have an influence on our eyes. We see worse and worse. I think that the problem is in our habits and lifestyle. We check our phones every ten minutes, read e-mail and boods from displays of out laptops and notebook and we <<don not**T2**Inappropriate_register**None**5**donâ€™t>> give our eyes time to relax. 

Secondly, there are problems with heart and and blood transporting system. We are seating all day and there <<is**T3**Spelling**None**2**us>> no <<physical**T4**Spelling**None**8**phisical>> activities in our life. But we need it! We need to do sport <<during the breakes**T5**Prepositions**None**10**in breakes>> between work.

Thirdly, gadgets take all our attention. That is why there are some incidents, such as <<cars**T6**Noun_number**None**3**car>> heating people because <<the driver**T7**Articles**None**6**driver>> was <<using**T8**lex_item_choice**None**7**telling>> phone <<or**T9**Spelling**None**3**our>> <<writing**T10**Tense_choice**None**5**write>> an e-mail. Or because pedestrians walk through the road <<looking at**T11**lex_item_choice**None**9**seeing in>> <<phones**T12**Noun_number**None**5**phone>>, or tracking places in navigator. 

However, gadgets can help us to be <<healthy**T13**Category_confusion**None**6**health>>. <<For example,**T14**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> <<there are**T15**Spelling**None**8**thereare>> some interesting <<apps**T16**Spelling**None**12**appsications>> for our phones that <<give**T17**Agreement_errors**None**5**gives>> <<the opportunity**T18**Articles**None**11**opportunity>> to count steps, <<wake up**T19**Tense_choice**None**7**woke up>> at the same time, check pressure journal and so on.
