There is a serious problem with pirates on the Internet. Such people use others work (films, music, songs) and make money, spreading materials on the world wide web. Some people think that such activities must be ban, and users, who downloads illegal files, should be punished too. I partely agree with this opinion and I will try to explain my possition in the essay.

First of all, people, copying music and films, do it illegal, without agreement of authors. It is theft and fraud. Moreover, pirates not only copy, but also share and even seld fils. In many contries it is prohibit on the government level. Hence, pirates act against the low and people help them, buying or downloading copies, instead of paying to real authors.

However, actions of pirates have a positive effect too. Firstly, the make an advertisment for films, which they are copying. For example, human downloaded film from the internet, watched it and decided to go to the cinema for watching film in the full-screen.

Secondly, due to pirates there are a lot of films on the Internet and films by unfamous producers too. Human may know about talanted artists or directors, whose films you cannot see on TV.

Moreover, because of sharing music or films on the Internet, they become widespread and people who have not the opportunity to buy expensive DVD may watch his or her favourite film on the Internet.

To sum up, activity of pirates is illegal and cause damage to authors. However, there are some benefits for people who like watching films or listening music - they may do it free.
