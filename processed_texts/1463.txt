I will try to describe this situation from both sides.

Firstly, I agree that this is a big problem in these industries. Let’s start from <<the fact**T1**Articles**None**4**fact>> that <<I am**T2**Inappropriate_register**None**3**I’m>> a huge fan of music and cinema. Usually, <<I buy**T3**Tense_choice**None**10**I’m buying>> music on I-tunes, or in any other <<online store**T4**lex_item_choice**None**13**internet shop>>. And of course, usually I <<go**T5**Tense_choice**None**8**am going>> to the cinema<< with my friends or with my girlfriend**T7**Punctuation**None**40**, with my friends, or with my girlfriend>> <<, or maybe even alone**T8**Punctuation**None**19**or maybe even alone>>. So <<It is**T10**Inappropriate_register**None**4**It’s>> normal for me to <<spend money on**T11**Prepositional_verb**None**15**spend money for>> these kinds of entertainment. And I understand that my money are very important for <<musicians**T12**Noun_number**None**8**musician>> <<and producers.**T13**Punctuation**None**14**and producers,>> But <<, on the other hand,**T14**Punctuation**None**18**on the other hand,>> I have two examples. First – I <<have known**T15**Tense_choice**None**15**have been known>> a lot of people, <<who are not able to spend money on this**T18**Defining**None**39**who are not able to spend money on this>>. <<There are**T19**Ref_device**None**4**It’s>> people whose life is harder than mine in many ways, especially in financial possibilities. And I understand them extremely well<< when**T22**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> they <<downloand**T20**Tense_choice**None**11**downloading>> ‘illegal’ copies of films <<from the Internet**T21**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>>. And I have an example of my father. He is a musician, and <<I know very well that**T23**Punctuation**None**22**I know very well, that>> <<the outcome of public concerts is**T25**Absence_comp_sent**None**30**the outcome of public concerts>> #DELETE#2#in many times <<bigger than**T27**Punctuation**None**12**bigger, than>> a little percentage of <<disks' sales**T28**Possessive**None**10**disk sales>>, because the main part of it goes to producers. So I prefer to separate musicians and producers. And <<, in my opinion,**T30**Punctuation**None**14**in my opinion,>> <<the amount**T31**Articles**None**6**amount>> of money <<lost**T32**lex_item_choice**None**6**losing>> is highly overrated. Financially successful films always have a good outcome, despite of any factors. <<So,**T33**Punctuation**None**2**So>> <<the problem**T34**Articles**None**7**problem>> is very overrated.
