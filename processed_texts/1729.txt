This bar chart demonstrates <<statistic**T322**Category_confusion**None**10**statistics>> and <<analytic**T323**Category_confusion**None**9**analitics>> information on the print and eBook market in four countries in 2014 with a <<prognosis**T324**Spelling**None**8**prognose>> for 2018.
To make our own analysis, we will look to all the data presented <<separately**T325**Spelling**None**9**separatly>>. There are four countries with different reading <<models**T326**Noun_number**None**5**model>>. For example, China is <<a country**T327**Articles**None**7**country>> with the highest population, but is doesn't <<provide**T328**Tense_form**None**8**provides>> numbers of chart <<being**T329**Category_confusion**None**2**be>> also the greatest. Numbers here are not percentage, but US Dollars ammounts. Greatest level of money spent on books at all is in the USA. It is 16 Billion of US Dollars. Analytics<<, who made the chart,**T330**Punctuation**None**20**, who made the chart>> prognose it to be the same in 2018, but they also forecast significant change in coherence between print and eBook market. The last one's sellings will probably increase from 5,5 to 8,5 Billion US Dollars, that is more than in quarter. It is the most significant change in this bar chart.
Moving #DELETE#7#towards to <<the other countries' statistics**T332**Articles**None**53**other countries' statistics and analytics information>>, we should notice, that in all presented data eBooks' selling increases, but there is no country<< where it hits such a peak as it is in the USA**T333**Punctuation**None**47**, where it hits such a peak as it is in the USA>>. For example, in Germany <<printed**T334**Category_confusion**None**5**print>> books' level remains stable, while the eBooks' is rising. This data can allow us to notice a common production increase. <<At the same time,**T335**Punctuation**None**16**At the same time>> common production sellings in China will face a decline. The fall of sellings will probably be <<equal**T336**Tense_form**None**6**equals>> to 0,1 Billion US Dollars. <<The same thing**T337**Articles**None**10**Same thing>> can be noticed in the UK.
To sum up, we emphasize one more time positive tendentions in the USA and Germany and underline a merely not significant decline in China and UK sellings, based on analytics information of this bar chart.
