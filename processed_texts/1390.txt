Nowadays many people think that the widespread use of modern <<technologies**T3**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> <<will be**T1**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> making problems with health in nearly future. <<In the essay I write**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**23**In the essay writewrite>> about some of these health problems and in what ways <<these**T8**Ref_device**None**5**those>> problems <<can be**T2**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**be>> reduced.

In fact, modern <<technologies**T11**Noun_number**Dependent_change**10**technology>> <<have**T12**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**has>> <<a real influece**T9**Articles**None**14**real influence>> on our lives. For #DELETE#4#easy example, you #DELETE#6#should forget your mobile at home and feel yourself very uncomfortable #DELETE#6#during all day. It meant<< that**T16**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> technologies <<make**T17**Agreement_errors**None**5**makes>> <<people**T18**lex_item_choice**None**6**humans>> <<addicted to**T19**Prepositions**None**11**addicted by>> them. It would <<lead to**T20**lex_item_choice**None**7**grow in>> psychological problems and <<people will need**T22**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**will need>> the doctor’s <<intervention**T21**lex_item_choice**None**7**heloing>>. <<The second problem**T23**Articles**None**14**Second problem>> is <<polluting**T24**lex_item_choice**None**7**wasting>> our planet. Every year oceans and lakes <<suffer**T25**lex_item_choice**None**13**are sorrowing>> from factories, <<that**T26**Ref_device**None**5**whose>> <<throw waste into them**T27**lex_item_choice**None**19**take at their waste>>, like plastic or chemical products. <<The ecology**T29**Articles**None**7**Ecology>> <<needs**T28**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> our protection, <<or**T30**Linking_device**None**10**in bad way>> we <<will not**T31**lex_item_choice**None**9**could not>> be here.

For <<the first issue**T32**Articles**None**11**first issue>> I suggest that people need more <<to communicate**T34**Category_confusion**None**13**communication>> without mobile or computer devices. We lost our abilities to live after using <<phones**T37**Noun_number**None**5**phone>> or <<the Internet**T42**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> on <<a computer**T38**Articles**None**8**computer>>. And about <<the second problem**T39**Articles**None**14**second problem>> – our future <<is in**T40**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**in>> our hands. Goverment should <<recycle the waste**T42**Tense_choice**None**9**recycling>> in cities.
