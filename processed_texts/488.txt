It is a <<well known**T2**Spelling**None**10**well-known>> fact that many people prefer British and American films to locally <<produced**T3**Spelling**None**8**prodused>> ones. Why is it so? Let us investigate this problem.
First of all, we all live in the age of globalization. All cultures become slightly closer to each other. Some scientists even claim that there are no longer any local cultures, as all of them have been replaced with one global culture. T<<However,**T4**lex_item_choice**None**6**Though>> parts which different countries take in this global culture are known not to be equal. British and American cultures have influenced other cultures a lot. That is why nowadays people watching films p<<produced**T13**Spelling**None**8**prodused>>in these countries or reading books written there are indeed connected with that global culture more than those who do not.
The second reason for people to watch British or American films rather than lo<<the locally produced ones**T11**Articles**None**21**locally produced ones>>s that th<<the former**T12**Ref_device**None**9**the first>>as I personally believe, are more mass-oriented. What I mean by this is that films pr<<produced**T10**Spelling**None**8**prodused>>here do not contain any hidden sense (though some films might pretend to do so, but, in my opinion, it is only a strategy to please so<<some particular**T14**Spelling**None**14**someparticular>>inds of spectators). The logic of British and American films is quite clear (in comparison to, let us say, Custuritsa's or Kislyovsky's films). It is also possible to say that people do not need to think a lot or to solve some puzzles to completely understand these films. And this strategy works perfectly, as people nowadays like watching films mostly in od<<order**T9**Spelling**None**4**oder>>o relax and give their minds some rest.
