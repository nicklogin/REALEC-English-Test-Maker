Some people think that it is more important to spend money on solving social problems such as poverty or environmental issues than on space exploration <<, and others have an opposite opinion**T1**Punctuation**None**35**and others have an opposite opinion>>.
As for me, space exploration is more important than solving environmental issues. It is more urgent because space exploration can help scientists to get some new k<<knowledge**T2**Noun_number**None**10**knowledges>>about the environment on the Earth. For example, something about atmosphere. Consequently, it might help the government to find new solutions t<<of**T3**Prepositions**None**2**to>>the urgent ecological problems on our planet, such as air pollution or the extinction of animals because of bad conditions in forests or on fields.
In addition, one of space ex<<exploration**T8**Possessive**None**13**exploratoin's>>ssues is to find appropriate living conditionds on other planets. If the scientists could find it, people could move to another planet, << where environmental and social problems do not exsist**T6**Defining**None**55**, where environmental and social problems do not exsist>>There would be no poverty or other problems. It would be a great opportunity to start th#DELETE#3#e life from the very beginning.
Space exploration also means that the science is good developed. This factor is very important, because it shows that we are not just human beings, but the people, who can think and dev<<develop**T8**Spelling**None**8**develope>>inally, space exploration is highly important and it is neccessary to spend money on developing it.
