People prefer take <<things**T1**Noun_number**None**5**thing>> for free instead of buying something. For example, people like to took art or <<any other entertainment**T43**Spelling**None**12**intertaiment>> for free too: musicians and film producers lose <<their**T4**Ref_device**None**6**theirs>> money because of illegal pirate copies, <<which**T5**Conjunctions**None**4**what>> people <<like to download**T6**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**13**like download>> instead of buying originals. I do not agree with <<the opinion**T7**Articles**None**7**opinion>><< that**T8**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<people who download pirate copies of films or music from the Internet**T9**Defining**None**70**people, who download pirate copies of films or music from the Internet>> are <<thieves**T11**Spelling**None**7**thifths>> and should be punished.

Firstly, art is not goods. People make art because they want to share with others <<their**T12**Ref_device**None**6**theirs>> ideas and knowledges. <<Artists**T13**Noun_number**None**6**Artist>>, musicians or film directors do not think about money<< if**T14**Punctuation**None**4**, if>> they have <<a true talant**T15**Articles**None**11**true talant>>. They earn money from other job, not from art.

Secondly, we have other music and films<< that**T17**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> are not art. It is just <<entertainment**T19**Spelling**None**13**intertainment>>. People can buy <<tickets to the cinema**T20**Prepositions**None**21**tickets in the cinema>> or #DELETE#2#on <<concerts**T22**Noun_number**None**7**consert>> for this kind of music and films. Producers can earn money from this and people can <<have**T23**lex_item_choice**None**4**take>> <<a pleasure**T24**Articles**None**8**pleasure>>. 

Finally, <<I think that**T25**Punctuation**None**13**I think, that>> people<< who download pirate copies**T26**Defining**None**29**, who download pirate copies,>> are not <<thieves**T27**Spelling**None**6**thifts>>. They <<do no do**T28**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**do not>> bad things like <<kidnaping**T29**Spelling**None**9**kidneping>> or killing #DELETE#12#of old woman. They just want to know about art and life <<for**T31**lex_item_choice**None**2**or>> pleasure. Of course, producers <<struggle with**T33**Prepositions**None**11**struggle of>> this situatuin, but they can do <<cheaper**T34**Spelling**None**7**chipper>> projects for people. In my opinion, they spend a lot of money on films or music<< that**T35**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> are not good. <<Nowadays**T37**Punctuation**None**9**Nowadays,>> we have <<a bad concept of**T39**Prepositions**None**17**a bad concept for>> big money. I <<think**T40**Spelling**None**5**thing>>, it is <<a wrong situation**T41**Articles**None**15**wrong situation>>. We can spend not #DELETE#4#many <<so much**T43**lex_item_choice**None**4**many>> for art and it will be good.
