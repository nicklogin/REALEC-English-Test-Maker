Every day people download gigabytes of illegal pirate copies of music, movies, books <<on**T1**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the <<Internet**T2**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. Movie makers and <<musicians**T3**Spelling**None**9**musitians>> lost billions of dollars because of it. That is why people are <<divided**T4**Spelling**None**7**devided>> into two groups. <<The first group**T5**Articles**None**11**First group>> supposes that every one can download music <<or**T6**Spelling**None**2**of>> films which he likes, instead of buying the original products. Other people think that downloading pirate content is some kind of <<stealing**T7**Category_confusion**None**5**steal>>, that is why it is <<illegal**T8**Spelling**None**7**illigal>>.
<<in**T9**Prepositions**None**4**From>> my point of view, <<the second group**T10**Articles**None**12**second group>> of people is right, illegal copies downloading should be punished for the following reasons.
First of all, film producers <<or**T11**Spelling**None**2**of>> musicians spend a lot of money and time to <<make**T12**Often_confused**None**2**do>> <<a movie**T13**Articles**None**5**movie>> <<or**T14**Spelling**None**2**of>> <<a song**T15**Articles**None**4**song>>. It is <<a very difficult process**T16**Articles**None**22**very difficult process>>, because they do something new, develop <<their**T17**Spelling**None**4**heir>> own ideas. There are a lot of examples, which show us that movie makers can invest hundred <<millions**T18**Spelling**None**7**millons>> of dollars to make a good film. <<If people did not pay for the original content,**T19**Punctuation**None**46**If people did not pay for the original content>> film producers <<will lose**T21**Tense_form**None**9**will lost>> their money and they will not make new films.
Secondly, a lot <<of**T22**Spelling**None**2**od>> pirate copies have <<a very bad quality**T23**Articles**None**16**very bad quality>>, that is why people can not enjoy music or <<a film**T24**Articles**None**4**film>> as well as <<an original copy**T25**Articles**None**13**original copy>>. There are a lot of examples<< when**T26**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> people watch <<a pirate copy**T27**Articles**None**11**pirate copy>> of <<a film**T28**Articles**None**4**film>> in <<a very law quality**T29**Articles**None**16**very low quality>> <<, and**T30**Punctuation**None**3**and>> that is why they have <<a wrong opinion**T31**Articles**None**13**wrong opinion>> about this product.
<<On**T32**Prepositions**None**4**From>> the other hand, some people <<don't**T33**Spelling**None**4**dont>> have enough money to pay for the original content. In this situation people want to entertain themselves.
This position is wrong, because in this case people can watch TV.
In conclusion, all of us can understand that pirate copies downloading should be punished.
