Nowadays the number of pirates on the Internet is dramatically huge. Therefore companies all around the world which make any content face problems with illegal spreading their materials. In my terms Internet users can not do any things (including wathing, copying, sharing, buying) with copies

There are some reasons for my point of view: polytical, economical, moral aspects.

First of all, there is one important thing every pirat should know and understand: illegal character of making copies of author’s materials. In many countries the law says about punishment for pirats’ work. Film and music companies, authors and directors do a big work to make a great result. While they want to show it to the audience, the least do not appreciate that intellectual and mechanical work. Such type of behaviour leads to financial problems for companies: they lose their money due to the fact that audience does not want to pay for entertainment. Moreover, it is moral theft: any product of any work should be paied.

Nevertheless, a lot of Internet users have wathed a pirat film at minimum once, I think. I can make a suggestion that they do not have an opportunity to visit the cinema or to by a CD or music fyle in official internet shops. But does it mean that we should become virtual pirats?

To sum up, of course, it is up to concreate person wheather to use illegal copy or not. However, I’d like to make an accent: every result of author’s work should be respected and paied. Thus pirats should be punished.
