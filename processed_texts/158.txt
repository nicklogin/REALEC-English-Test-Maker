The <<increase in**T1**lex_part_choice**None**7**rise of>> the amount of crimes being committed by young people is a complex problem which is caused by multiple factors. In the last decades children <<have had**T2**Tense_choice**None**3**had>> less time with their families. <<Instead,**T3**Punctuation**None**7**Instead>> their <<time schedule**T4**Category_confusion**None**12**timeschedule>> has changed from the traditional <<one**T5**lex_item_choice**None**8**approach>>, which <<gave**T8**lex_item_choice**None**3**had>> the prevailing role <<to**T9**Prepositions**None**2**of>> #DELETE#3#the family and community, to the modern one, which radically reduces <<their influence on the children's moral values**T7**Absence_explanation**None**37**their influence on their moral values>> and gives the main part of teaching <<the young**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**14**the youngsters>> to kindergartens, <<school**T12**Spelling**None**6**scools>>, colleges and universities <<, to a lesser extent.**T16**Punctuation**None**17**to lesser extent.>> This <<tendency**T13**Suffix**None**10**tendention>> can be described as <<systematization**T17**Spelling**None**15**sistematization>> of the educational process which results in less attention for <<a child's**T45**Articles**None**4**kids>> <<individuality as well as his or her**T21**Absence_comp_sent**None**25**individuality, his or her>> concerns and interests <<, and**T20**Punctuation**None**3**and>> a strict demand for accomplishing <<various goals**T22**lex_item_choice**None**14**several points>>, like this exam. Children feel less obliged to follow norms <<of the society**T23**Prepositional_noun**None**14**in the society>> as long as they deal with these points. Also it makes them less relaxed and more agressive <<, which**T24**Conjunctions**None**4**what>> <<leads**T25**lex_item_choice**None**9**brings us>> to high crime rates. The second reason is <<the constant urbanization**T26**Determiners**None**21**constant urbanization>> #DELETE#12#in the would which is <<defined as**T28**lex_item_choice**None**16**characterized by>> <<an increas in**T29**Category_confusion**None**9**increasin>>g <<the number of**T30**lex_item_choice**None**4**part>> of people who live in cities. <<They mostly face people**T31**Standard**None**23**They face mostly people>> whom they do not know at all and have no feelings for them. That is why crimes become more probable and we register them more frequently. Young people do not feel <<ashamed of**T32**Prepositional_adjective**None**11**ashamed for>> <<anybody,**T33**Punctuation**None**7**anybody>> as they see them for the first and the last time <<, in their opinion**T34**Punctuation**None**16**in their opinion>>.
Parents and teachers should make <<children feel responsibility**T36**Absence_explanation**None**23**children responsibility>> for their acts. <<For example,**T38**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> <<they could show the children**T39**Absence_explanation**None**9**show them>> how they should get <<rid**T40**Spelling**None**4**ridd>> of litter <<serving as examples**T41**Absence_explanation**None**21**by their own examples>>. That is important because people tend to leave litter in <<places**T42**Articles**None**10**the places>> which are already <<full of**T43**Prepositional_adjective**None**9**full with>> it. That corresponds with the "theory of broken windows". <<To sum up, you should raise**T44**Linking_device**None**5**Raise>> <<your children**T45**Absence_explanation**None**4**them>> with the idea of equality of people.
