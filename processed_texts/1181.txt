Today almost every country <<produces**T34**Agreement_errors**None**7**produce>> a lot of food for <<itself**T3**Agreement_errors**None**9**themselfs>> and for <<-**T4**Articles**None**3**the>> export. But people <<think**T6**Spelling**None**4**thin>> that countries should not produce food for <<-**T5**Articles**None**3**the>> export. 

<<On the one hand,**T21**Punctuation**None**13**From one hand>> it is better for <<economy**T31**Often_confused**None**9**economics>> <<in**T53**Prepositions**None**6**inside>> the country to produce food and products only for <<its**T10**Agreement_errors**None**5**their>> population, because it <<supports**T8**Voice**None**10**is support>> small businesses in that area and <<helps them develop**T9**Word_choice**None**17**will improve them>> <<so that**T7**Linking_device**None**4**that>> in the future <<the country**T35**Articles**None**7**country>> could <<strenghthen**T11**lex_item_choice**None**4**rise>> the whole economy.

But <<, on the other hand,**T21**Punctuation**None**18**on the other hand,>> some countries <<are experts**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**experts>> in one <<type**T14**Spelling**None**4**tipe>> of products <<, and**T54**Punctuation**None**3**and>> they sell <<these**T16**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> products to another country <<in order to buy**T37**Absence_explanation**None**6**to buy>> different types of food. It <<is called**T22**Voice**None**4**call>> co-supporting (<<helping**T25**Lack_par_constr**None**7**to help>> <<others**T24**Pronouns**None**11**each others>> <<so that**T26**Linking_device**None**3**and>> they will help you). #DELETE#7#Because <<Some**T55**Capitalisation**None**4**some>> countries cannot produce some <<types of food**T38**Confusion_of_structures**None**10**food types>> because of <<the climate**T21**Articles**None**6**climat>> #DELETE#30#or type of the ground and etc. Countries should cooperate with each other to <<maintain**T27**Often_confused**None**7**support>> <<-**T28**Articles**None**3**the>> stable economy. 

<<Furthermore,**T36**Punctuation**None**11**Furthermore>> it might <<help**T44**Verb_pattern**None**9**help with>> <<the economy**T21**Articles**None**8**economic>> <<in**T41**Prepositions**None**6**inside>> the country to <<reduce**T32**Word_choice**None**7**do less>> import and support <<the country's**T1**Ref_device**None**5**their>> own <<production**T33**Category_confusion**None**7**produce>> of <<-**T51**Articles**None**3**the>> food. I do not agree with this part of the <<statement**T17**Spelling**None**9**staytment>><< because sometimes country just can not produce fresh food for all population and it gives more import from another country to support them**T47**Punctuation**None**136**, because sometimes country just can not produce fresh food for all population and it imports more from another country to support them.>>

In my opinion, countries should improve their <<economy**T30**Often_confused**None**8**economic>> <<from inside**T18**Absence_comp_colloc**None**6**inside>> by producing more food for themselves. I <<with the statement that**T39**Absence_comp_colloc**None**13**disagree that>> countries should aim to import as little as possible, because sometimes they <<have to**T52**lex_item_choice**None**3**can>> do this because of the climate or <<other**T20**lex_item_choice**None**7**another>> difficulties. Countries should support each <<other**T21**lex_part_choice**None**6**others>>.
