All of the large and powerful countries want to become number one in space exploration. To prove this it is enough to <<remember**T360**Verb_pattern**None**14**remember about>> <<the space race**T361**Articles**None**10**space race>> between <<the USA**T362**Articles**None**3**USA>> and <<the USSR**T363**Articles**None**4**USSR>> during The Cold War in the 20th century. However, space exploration asks for a lot of money. Many people think that, probably, it would be better to <<spend this money on**T364**Prepositional_verb**None**20**spend this money for>> more everyday problems.
In my opinion, g<<governments**T365**Spelling**None**10**goverments>>should put urgent problems first and pay much more attention to them than to space exploration. First of all, g<<governments**T366**Spelling**None**10**goverments>>need to look after t<<their**T367**Spelling**None**5**theis>>citizens, not after stars. They must build new roads, improve hospitals and e<<the educational system**T377**Articles**None**18**educational system>> If countries have money for spaceships but do not have g<<a good level**T378**Articles**None**10**high level>>of life, i<<their governments are bad**T368**Absence_comp_sent**None**32**it is a bad governmentgovernment>> Stars are wonderful b<<, but**T370**Punctuation**None**3**but>>m<<millions of people**T371**Prepositional_noun**None**15**millions people>>in the world live in poverty and cannot afford even their own h<<homes**T380**Noun_number**None**4**home>> Society problems should be solved before space exploration because spaceships and colonies on Mars would not be needed by anyone, if there are dying citizens who cannot a<<afford**T372**Spelling**None**6**affort>>healthcare.
Secondly, space exploration has no practical aim now. It is only science. It cannot improve or change li<<lives**T390**Noun_number**None**4**life>>f co<<countries**T373**Spelling**None**8**counties>>If so, why would go<<the government**T381**Articles**None**9**goverment>>aste citizens' money for this? For example, In<<The International Space Station**T383**Articles**None**27**International Space Station>>s a great project but it means nothing to everyday life. Some of mo<<the money**T384**Articles**None**5**money>>hould be spent fo<<on**T385**Prepositions**None**3**for>>pace but only for su<<the support**T386**Articles**None**7**support>>f science. At the same time it seems like for many countries space exploration is a question of de<<life or death**T387**lex_part_choice**None**14**death and life>>This fact is weird because it does not solve problems and wo<<will**T388**Agreement_errors**None**5**would>>ot in many years.
In conclusion, developing of science is imp<<an important part**T374**Articles**None**14**important part>> budgets. However, this part should not be made by cutting other parts, which are more crucial for society.

Spaceships can wait.
