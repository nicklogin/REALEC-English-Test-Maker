Nowadays many people download films and music from the internet because the do not want to pay for it. Musicians and producers suffer considerable losses as a consequences of it. Some people think that it is normal to use pirate copies. Their opponents assume that these illegal actions should be punished. I claim there must be punishment for illegal copying and sharing music and video materials.

In my opinion, people should be punished for distributing pirate copies. Firstly, people who worked on a particular project lose their profit because of it. Secondly, it is dishonest that people who make illegal copies of music and films start to distribute it and turn it into a business. They gather money from people who buy this copies inspite of the fact that they have not made any contribution into the product. What is more, musicians and film producers need money to develop their activity and to get more opportunities but it is impossible as far as the profit from their products is too low because of the pirate copies which people download from the Internet.

Some people disagree with this point of view. They believe that downloading illegal copies of films and music should not be punished at all. From their point of view, people are not so rich to pay for every film they want to watch and for every song they want to listen. Besides, people assume that companies or groups which produce films or music have enough money to go on creating new ideas.

To sum up, the problem under consideration is multiple-valued. So many men, so many minds. I am inclined to think that distribution of pirate copies and downloading files from the internet instead buying should be punished. However, different points of view have the right to exist.
