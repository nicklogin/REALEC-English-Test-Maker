The issue of using illegal drugs in sport elicts a lot of controversy nowadays. Some people believe, that cheating athlets should be prohibited from competing for the rest of their livesâ€™, orthers suppose that this period should be limited. This essay will discuss both points of view.
First point to be consider is that sportsmen, who are banned from competing for their whole life will hardly find another place in society. Sport is not just a profession or a hobby for athletes, it is the key point of their lives. It can be argued, that using drugs, a sportsman shows his desire for a good result rather than admiration for sport and such behavior should be punished. Any balanced view must take into account this alternative argument.
Looking at this issue from another point of view, a limited break in sport career will not necesseraly mean, that an athlet will stop using illegal drugs. Moreover, such a break will most likely make him or her to do so, in order to reach a high results again.
The last but not least is that unfortunately, these tests are not always accurate. Sometimes mistakes are possible. Furthermore, sport is not free from politics and sometimes the results of drug-tests are influenced by goverments. It is my strong believe, that to break somebody's life because of political issues is too cruel. To my mind, it'is a strong argument for a limited period.
In balance, I should say that there are strong arguments for both points of view. Nevetheless, it seems to me that arguments for a limited period outweight arguments against it. To prevent people from the sense of their life because of politics is rather cruel.
