The graph gives information about population size, fertility and morality in the United States for the period of 1750-2000.
The first graph, depicting population, in general terms, points out a steady growth of people from 1750 up to 2000. From 1750 year the number of people was very low, even equal to 0 and continued remaining stable up to 1800. After this period of time USA population started to go upward, where was observed a number of less than 50 million people, which surged to approximately 300 million for two hundred years.
The second graph, illustrates birth and death rates from 1700 to 2000. Birth rate, beginning from 1700-1800 was quite leveled, but in the 1850 death rate fall down steeply, accounting for 20 hundred people in contrast to 35 of birth rate. However, to the end of the period (in the 1950) birth rate went up sharply, outgone the death rate in 10 hundred people.
If comparing three graphs, there can be observed that population size of USA was much bigger than that of birth and death rates.
