From the following graph we can see that the amount of people of different ages using the major social networks differs greatly from network to network. The obvious outlier is LinkedIn, which tends to attract a more mature audience, with people over 30 years old being its major demographic. Only 22% of people aged 18-29 that use the Internet have a LinkedIn account, but that percentage rises to 31% among people aged 30-49 and 30% among 50-64. Facebook and Instagram have a similar tendency to be more attractive to a younger audience, however their numbers differ greatly, with Facebook dominating the market at 87% of people aged 18-29 using it, as well as 56% of people over 65, which is considerably less, but still extremely impressive compared to the other two. Instagram has a much sharper decline, with 53% of users among people aged 18-29 and only 25% among people aged 30-49 and even less further along.
