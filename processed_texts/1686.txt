Everybody cheats. Unfortunately, we can be faced with cheating every day, as it is a common occassion. Sport is not an exception. Cheating in sport takes form of using illegal drugs by sportsmen to increase their physical powers. This essay will discuss two points of view, whether athletes on forbidden drugs should be excluded from competition forever or for a certain period.
Some people believe that sport is not a field for deception. Achieving high results demands a lot of hardwork, concentration and pain. If a sportsman was caught on using chemicals, which are banned, he could not be considered as a real athlete. He loses all respect of sport community. Adherents of this point of view consider that if there was cheating, it can take place the other time.
On the other hand, there is another opinion that everybody can get a chance. Some of us are convinced that nobody is perfect, and even famous athletes can make a wrong choice. They remind us that there is an enormous pressure on competitions. Every athlete is determined to win. They are suppressed by the couches, family and even government. Therefore, illegal drugs are the way to calm the nerves and be sure of victory. Following this way of thought, people believe that it is too severe to end careers of sportsmen, who had been working hard all their lives to master their skills and who got caught of cheating the first time.
From my point of view, all athletes who got caught on using forbidden drugs should be banned only if it was their second time. Despite using drugs for the first time being a serious issue, it seems to me that one occasion should not bring athlete's career to the end.
To conclude, using drugs is considered as a grave form of cheating. However, sometimes it should not ruin one's previous labour and achievements.
