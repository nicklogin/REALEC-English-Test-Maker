Nowadays some people think that the best way <<to improve**T1**Infinitive_constr**None**13**for improving>> #DELETE#2#of <<the quality**T18**Articles**None**8**quantity>> of their lives is to import as little as possible and to eat the food that was produced only in their country. I am not agree with this <<statement**T5**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**state>>, #DELETE#7#because <<, in my opinion,**T7**Punctuation**None**13**in my opinion>> globalization is  a must for well-being of the whole world. 

Firstly, <<it is so**T8**Absence_explanation**None**5**it is>> because of the fact that <<a country**T9**Articles**None**7**country>> may not have a territory that would <<allow it**T10**Reflexive_verb**None**5**allow>> to grow food for <<its**T11**lex_item_choice**None**3**all>> population. For example, Monaco has a very small territory and a big number of people living there. So, the only way to have enough sources for all humans is to trade with other countries and to import products.

Secondly, <<contry's climate**T12**Articles**None**21**the countryâ€™s climate>> is the main factor for <<a good agricultural policy**T13**Articles**None**24**good agricultural policy>>. If the weather is good all over the year then it is not the problem to provide the population with food, because you can seed all the year. However, if it is a cold winter, you are not able to grow food all the time. The situation in northern countries such as Canada, Russia, Sweden is very similar to this argument. 

Finally, <<countries**T14**Noun_number**None**11**the country>> need to have <<very good and developed factories**T15**Articles**None**35**a very good and developed factories>> to make deliscious and high-quality food that people will enjoy<<. They**T16**Punctuation**None**6**, They>> <<need**T18**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**needs>> a lot of money and it is more expensive than buying food from other countries. 

To sum up, as for me, I do not believe that the isolation will help any country to become modern and reach.
