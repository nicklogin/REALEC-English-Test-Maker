There are many people that <<think**T1**lex_item_choice**None**5**count>> that countries should produce food only for <<their**T2**Ref_device**None**3**its>> <<populations**T3**Noun_number**None**10**population>> and try to import as less as they can. 

I am completely disagree with this statement, because nowadays many countries just cannot produce enough food, so they have to import <<it**T4**Ref_device**None**3**one>> from other countries. For instance, African’s and Arabic’s countries, due to their climat, it is impossible <<for**T5**Prepositions**None**2**to>> them <<to reject**T6**Infinitive_constr**None**6**reject>> <<other countries**T7**Possessive**None**17**other’s countries>> food. 

However, many people #DELETE#3#may call science as <<the solution**T9**Articles**None**8**solution>> for this problem, it means <<these**T10**Ref_device**None**5**those>> counties should use modern agricultural technics to provide food. Also, people <<, who support the idea of decreasing import,**T11**Non_defining**None**42**who support the idea of decreasing import,>> may say that #DELETE#20#it is dangerous then the amount of food depends on <<the external countries’ industry**T13**Articles**None**28**external countries’ industry>>. 

<<When talk about modern agricultural,**T15**Punctuation**None**38**When talking about modern agricultural>> <<it is**T16**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**it>> just hard to apply to <<African and Arabic**T17**Spelling**None**20**Africans and Arabics>> <<countries**T19**Noun_number**None**9**countries>> dependencies <<, it is**T18**Punctuation**None**5**it is>> not one-direction interaction, because <<African and Arab**T20**Spelling**None**20**Africans and Aabiccs>> countries which export food to them also <<depend on**T22**Prepositional_verb**None**11**depend from>> <<their**T23**Ref_device**None**4**they>> oil production<<. And**T24**Punctuation**None**5**, And>> it is not more <<a dependence**T26**Articles**None**10**dependence>>, but something like cooperation.

To sum up, there are no reasons to produce food only for countrie’s production and decrease import. It is <<the opposite**T32**Spelling**None**7**opposit>>, <<sharing**T29**Tense_choice**None**5**share>> and <<exchanging**T30**Tense_choice**None**8**exchange>> <<resourses**T31**Spelling**None**8**recouces>> between countries usually cause <<a positive effect**T32**Articles**None**15**positive effect>>.
