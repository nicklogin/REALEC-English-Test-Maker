The Internet <<is of special importance to**T319**Word_choice**None**22**has a special power on>> musicians and <<filmmakers**T1**Spelling**None**11**film-makers>>. Nowadays <<technology**T320**Articles**None**14**the technology>> <<allows stealing**T321**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**15**allows to steal>> their product, which means stealing money, so easily that almost any user can do it. It is a crime <<, and**T2**Punctuation**None**3**and>> pirates should be legally prosecuted.
It was made possible to exchange information freely and in great amounts. To produce this information costs a lot of effort and money <<to**T3**Prepositions**None**3**for>> creative people. A usual worker is paid for creating the product, so it would be fair if musicians and producers of films could <<be paid**T5**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**be>> as much as they deserve. Because of sharing files on the Internet they lose bigger money than ever: many people prefer enjoying free films at home <<to**T4**Prepositions**None**11**rather than>> paying for original <<recordings**T6**Often_confused**None**7**records>> or going to the cinema. <<Using**T323**lex_item_choice**None**6**Taking>> pirate copies is a theft, and it should not be left <<unpunished**T322**Word_choice**None**8**this way>>.
Another argument <<comes from**T324**lex_part_choice**None**7**is from>> <<the area**T337**Articles**None**6**a side>> of moral <<issues**T7**lex_item_choice**None**10**hazardness>>. <<Free-riding**T328**Articles**None**13**A free-riding>> <<has always been**T327**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**has always>> a problem for many generations. But in the past it was simpler to control free-riders: sharing something implied a real-life contact. Now <<virtual reality**T329**Articles**None**17**a virtual reality>> gives a broad <<range of**T10**Word_choice**None**9**space for>> possibilities not to buy something and use it without being punished. Music or films copied and shared on the Internet with one user <<or many**T330**Ref_device**None**11**and another>> <<make one feel that**T332**Confusion_of_structures**None**17**make it feel like>> ideas <<do not have to**T333**Modals**None**10**should not>> be <<paid for**T331**Prepositional_verb**None**4**paid>> at all. Such type of philosophy can <<eliminate**T334**lex_item_choice**None**11**exterminate>> any incentive to create something beautiful and share it.
Making pirate copies leads to huge money loss <<nowadays**T335**Word_choice**None**15**in current time>>, so it should be prohibited and punished. Giving free music and <<films**T11**Spelling**None**4**fims>> constantly forms a free-rider problem and certain beliefs<< that**T336**Defining**None**6**, that>> can become <<a moral hazard**T338**Articles**None**12**moral hazard>> in the future.
