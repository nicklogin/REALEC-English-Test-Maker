<<Nowadays**T1**Spelling**None**8**Nowaduys>>, there are a lot of different illegal pirate copies <<on**T2**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the Internet**T3**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. Some people believe that <<thieves**T4**Spelling**None**7**thiefes>> should be punished for illegal downloads and sharing music or films. <<In this essay i will discuss**T5**Ref_device**None**23**This essay will discuss>> about <<the actual problem**T7**Articles**None**14**actual problem>> in <<the modern world**T8**Articles**None**12**modern world>> and two different opinions about this cause.
One point of view <<is**T9**lex_item_choice**None**7**discuss>> about the private <<privilage**T11**Spelling**None**9**privelage>> and personal <<creation**T10**Spelling**None**8**creution>>. For authors<< whose plays are stolen**T12**Defining**None**25**, whose plays are stolen,>> <<it would be better**T13**Abs_comp_clause**None**15**would be better>> to compensate this <<illegal**T14**Spelling**None**8**illegale>> process. Undoubteadly the government will spend a huge amount of money for that <<spending**T15**Gerund_phrase**None**6**spends>>. But the justice for authors <<costs**T16**Agreement_errors**None**4**cost>> more. For instance, if someone <<steals**T17**Agreement_errors**None**5**steel>> a new album of favourite band it should be present as a purchase for authors. <<That would be great for both sides: the band will be sure that if something goes wrong, the government will compensate some money.**T22**Punctuation**None**129**That would be great for both sides: the band will be sure that if something goes wrong, the government will compensate some money>> <<The administration**T49**Articles**None**14**administration>> could catch <<thieves**T26**Spelling**None**6**thiefs>> and arrest them.
<<On the other hand, there is a law**T27**Confusion_of_structures**None**26**On the other hand is a law>> which will <<restrict**T31**lex_item_choice**None**6**arrest>> all illegal downloads in <<a particular country**T29**Articles**None**18**particular country>>. For example, if <<the government**T32**Articles**None**10**government>> catch one thief and <<arrest**T33**Tense_choice**None**8**arrested>> him for two weeks, all <<other**T34**Often_confused**None**7**another>> pirates will see the results of this illegal sharing. In that <<case**T35**Spelling**None**4**cuse>> many pirates could stop <<stealing**T36**lex_item_choice**None**8**thiefing>> and start <<getting interested**T37**Category_confusion**None**11**interesting>> what ever they want. Also, the administration could start banning all illegal sites. That would be much more useful in that situation. <<thieves**T38**Spelling**None**6**Thiefs>> couldn’t share their files <<, and**T39**Punctuation**None**3**and>> band <<wouldn't**T40**Tense_choice**None**5**won’t>> punish anyone.
<<To sum up,**T41**Punctuation**None**9**To sum up>> there are two different ways how to solve this <<problem**T42**Spelling**None**7**probles>>. <<In my personal opinion,**T43**Punctuation**None**22**In my personal opinion>> <<the government**T44**Articles**None**10**government>> should ban illegal sources and do not punish pirates. <<If the administration controls mass media,**T47**Punctuation**None**48**If the administration controlscontrol mass media>> this actual problem <<can**T49**Modals**None**5**could>> disappear.
