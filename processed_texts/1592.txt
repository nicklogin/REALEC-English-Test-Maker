<<A. Orlenko**T1**ADP**None**2**In>> today's modern world, people tend to rely on new technology, while old lifistyle goes away irrevocably. The popular belief is that improving the way of doing things, people forget and completely lose old <<traditions**T145**Noun_number**None**9**tradition>> and useful skills.
In my opinion, this <<is generally true**T146**Abs_comp_clause**None**14**generally true>> but not <<always.**T147**Punctuation**None**6**always>>
If it is <<undeniable that**T148**Punctuation**None**16**undeniable, that>> some experience of mankind, which was very helpful and even essential.
people in <<contemporary**T149**Spelling**None**11**contemprory>> world can hardly imagine <<their**T150**Spelling**None**4**ther>> lives without machines. Every day either a new gadget is invented or an old one is improved.
Different people appreciate new inventions differently. Some suppose that sophisticated gadgets are really useful and necessary, <<while**T152**Spelling**None**5**whale>> others find them absolutely <<awful**T153**Spelling**None**5**auful>> as they <<influence**T154**Spelling**None**9**infleonce>> people badly. As for me, I <<am pretty sure**T155**Abs_comp_clause**None**11**pretty sure>> that gadgets make people life easier.
