The <<Internet**T1**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> saves our lives every day. We can find everything there from information about <<any subject**T2**Determiners**None**7**subject>> <<to information about personal life**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**to personal life>> of our favorite actor, singer. Moreover, it <<has become**T4**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> very easy to download films from the <<Internet**T5**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> for free and <<not to go**T6**Negation**None**9**do not go>> to the cinema and spend your money.
There <<are**T7**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> two sides of this problem. <<Let us**T8**Spelling**None**6**Let is>> start with <<a point**T9**Articles**None**5**point>> <<that**T341**Conjunctions**None**5**where>> I agree with <<the statement**T10**Articles**None**9**statement>> that people who <<copy**T31**Tense_choice**None**7**copying>> films in the cinema and then download it <<at**T13**Prepositions**None**2**in>> different sites like <<Torrent**T15**Capitalisation**None**7**torrent>> <<, from which one can save it on their computer for free,**T342**Non_defining**None**55**, from which one can save it on their computer for free>> should be punished. Of course, it is bad for producers, singers and for <<groups**T16**Noun_number**None**5**group>> that <<produce**T348**lex_item_choice**None**5**cover>> the music#DELETE#25#, do some effects and etc. They <<have started**T17**Tense_choice**None**7**started>> this business to get money but when you download it for free they lose <<it**T346**Ref_device**None**4**them>>. The same situation <<happens if**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**if>> you work hard <<in**T350**Prepositions**None**2**on>> your job <<, and**T19**Punctuation**None**3**and>> someone <<comes**T20**Agreement_errors**None**4**come>> to you and <<steals**T21**Agreement_errors**None**5**steal>> your money. Overall, <<if you are punished,**T23**Punctuation**None**19**if you are punished>> you have to pay some big <<amount of money**T24**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**amount>> or go to prison.
<<On the other hand,**T31**lex_part_choice**None**17**On the other side>> people who <<steal**T352**Punctuation**None**7**“theft”>> music and films help everyone. Not everyone has money, <<and those who have too little**T353**Absence_explanation**None**4**they>> do not allow themselves to go to the cinema or buy discs with music. As for me, it really helps. I have <<a special application**T27**Articles**None**19**special application>> on my phone where I can <<download**T28**Spelling**None**7**downlod>> the music<< paying**T31**Punctuation**None**5**. Pay>> nothing or <<paying**T343**Lack_par_constr**None**3**pay>> 1000 rubles per month. If you <<skipped**T29**Spelling**None**6**skiped>> the movie that you really wanted to see, you will not go to the shop <<or**T357**Conjunctions**None**3**and>> buy <<disc; you**T358**Punctuation**None**8**disc you>> will <<borrow it from**T359**Word_choice**None**3**ask>> your friend <<, or**T30**Punctuation**None**2**or>> you can do it #DELETE#2#by yourself <<by downloading**T361**Confusion_of_structures**None**12**and download>> it on <<your computer**T362**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**computer>>
<<In conclusion,**T31**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> it can be said that people who download music and films without asking the authors should not be punished.
