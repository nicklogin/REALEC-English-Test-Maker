Sharing pirate copies of movies and music is a burning issue nowadays because people who made them do not get any money. It may seem that it is unfair and pirates should be punished but I do not think that it is the only solution. There are some reasons for my opinion.

At first, legal copes are mostly very expensive so users have not another choice exept download illegal ones. For examle, price of a popular game on the original disc may reach several thousands so teenagers can not afford to buy it just because they have not worked yet.

At second, as the territory of Russia is really large, there are a lot little towns where people can not get neccessary edition so they just download pirate copies. On the other side, there are a huge number of Internet-shops and it is rising gradually so this issue is going to be solved in several years.

To tell the truth, no one is scared of punishment because our legalation is not so developed to cover increasing quantity of problems connecting with the Internet so the solution of pirating problem may not be found in the laws, it should be controlled by morals and ideals.

To conclude, I would like to notice that solution of pirate issue should complex, spreading the legalation, morals, level of life. Only using comprehensive methods we make sharing and downloading pirate content disappear. Without these changes we will never see fair community without illegal sharing of creative products.
