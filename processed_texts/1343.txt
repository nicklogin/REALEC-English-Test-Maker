<<I am**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**3**I’m>> <<on the opinion**T2**Prepositions**None**14**of the opinion>> that sharing films and music on the <<Internet**T3**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> <<or downloading these files**T5**Absence_explanation**None**14**or downloading>> is <<a normal thing**T4**Articles**None**12**normal thing>> nowadays. Now some online-cinemas <<have found**T7**Tense_choice**None**5**found>> the way to make it legal and free – <<by adding advertisements before films**T9**Absence_explanation**None**14**by advertising>> #DELETE#9#promotion.
Firstly, I want to tell you that musicians and producers can earn money by other ways (for example, it can be concerts or permission for <<renting**T10**Category_confusion**None**4**rent>> movies). Secondly, I think that this is important #DELETE#5#thing for <<personal promotion**T12**Category_confusion**None**19**promotion of person>> – to make free music or films. It is significantly for producers, musicians, directors and <<other similar**T13**lex_item_choice**None**17**different similar>> professions – to make <<a personal brand**T14**lex_item_choice**None**9**self name>>, to <<become**T15**lex_item_choice**None**5**state>> famous in the world. Finally, it can be difficult to buy original products in most cities and towns in Russia (for example). I always <<watch**T16**lex_item_choice**None**4**show>> “The Simpsons” <<on**T17**Prepositions**None**2**by>> <<the pirate site**T18**Articles**None**11**pirate site>>, but in Russia we <<do not have original movie discs**T19**Negation**None**28**have no original movie discs>> and <<an official dubbing**T33**Articles**None**18**official translate>> in our language. We have no way to buy <<the official version**T22**Articles**None**16**official version>>! 
In conclusion, I want to tell you that <<it is**T23**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> not <<a bad thing to watch films on pirate sites**T33**Articles**None**9**bad thing>> and most producers <<do not lose**T33**Tense_choice**None**12**are not lose>> a lot of money by illegal pirate copies. They can make their money by other ways, and they do it! I know about “Hardcore Henry” film, producers of this movie got 14 millions of dollars, they earn these money only by <<selling the permission**T33**Articles**None**10**permission>> for <<renting**T30**Category_confusion**None**4**rent>> film in Russia and USA (10 millions!). So we see that pirate copies <<do not influence the huge amounts of money**T31**Negation**None**94**do not influenceinfluence the huge amount of moneythe huge amount of moneyhuge amount of money>>.
