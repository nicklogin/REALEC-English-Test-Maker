In the modern world the role of sports is getting very significant, as well as the use of illegal supportive medicines by professional sportsmen is becoming more widespread. There are considered to be two points of view on the banning of such sportsmen, who got caught on taking drugs to enhance their abilities.
On the one hand, some people think, that the punishment shouldn't be so crucial. Many people come with the opinion of banning such sportsmen from professional competition up to two years. This should be very adecuate punishment for that kind of sportsmen, who got caught for the first time. In that case that kind of restrictiont could prevent the further dopping scandales and not to crush the whole professional life of the spotsman.
On the other hand, there are a common opinion, that athletes, who use illegal drugs, should be banned for the rest of their lives. That kind of opinion, as for me, sounds too cruel. But to justify the competition, it should relate to that athlete, who was caught more than once. Otherwise, there is no point in the competition itself, when the human can't concquer on equal with others.
In my opinion, nowadays we have another case in this dopping stuff. Sometimes the political issues play a great role in orders of punishment, not looking on the societie's opinion. Recently, the commitee of world sports decides how they will punish one athelete or the whole team. That's why the main purpose is to reach the justice in the process of restrictions and then judge what this restriction will be.
