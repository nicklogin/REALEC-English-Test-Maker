Nowadays it is hard to imagine our lives without music, films or videos or any other media <<sources**T1**Spelling**None**7**sourses>>. However, it all needs money, so people <<have found**T2**Tense_choice**None**5**found>> a way to economize via creating illegal <<pirate**T3**Spelling**None**6**pirale>> copies. Some people think that there is nothing wrong in downloading pirate files. Others are sure that using copies, instead of buying the original discs, <<inspires**T4**Agreement_errors**None**7**inspire>> hackers to steal. That is why such actions are illegal as well, and people who download pirate copies should be punished.
From the one point of view, some measures should be taken to prevent pirate files from spreading. And the most profitable way to stop it is to influence potential clients, because there should be a demand for supply to exist. <<Consequently**T5**Spelling**None**11**Consequanly>>, if nobody downloads stolen files, nobody will steal.
From the other point of view, people have the right to download everything which might be downloaded. There are a lot of special programmes which help to secure files on the Internet. So if musicians and film producers want their files not to be copied, they should protect them better.
I personally think that it is too difficult to speak about originality <<in**T6**Prepositions**None**2**at>> the century of high technology and mass media. People use the Internet for their own aims <<, and**T7**Punctuation**None**3**and>> it is unfair to punish them for downloading something which is created for being downloaded.
To sum it up, even if the idea of punishing those<< who use pirate copies**T8**Defining**None**24**, who use pirate copies,>> is reasonable enough, it is too hard to make it real. There are <<millions of people**T9**Prepositions**None**15**millions people>> in the world who are used to free pirate files. It would be too difficult to control them all.
