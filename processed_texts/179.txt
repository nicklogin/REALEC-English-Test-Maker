Copyright legistation has appeared not so long ago but it <<arouses**T281**lex_item_choice**None**6**erases>> a lot of debates now <<as**T1**Conjunctions**None**5**being>> a very controversial issue. Some people think that illegal copying of music or films should be regarded as <<a theft**T2**Articles**None**5**theft>> and be punished <<the same way**T283**Redundant**None**15**in the same way>>. But it does not seem unreasonable to believe that copying has nothing in common with <<real theft**T3**Articles**None**14**the real theft>>.
The strongest <<argument**T4**Spelling**None**9**arguement>> in favour of this position is that such art works as songs, films and books should be spread around the world as <<widely**T282**Category_confusion**None**4**wide>> as <<possible**T12**Redundant_comp**None**14**it is possible>> instead of being restricted to copy. It is supposed that the Internet should <<provide people with an opportunity**T285**Prepositional_verb**None**29**provide people an opportunity>> to see what they cannot see live or to hear what they cannot hear in the <<concert hall**T6**Spelling**None**11**concerthall>>. Nevertheless, <<copyright legislation**T286**Articles**None**25**the copyright legislation>> does not <<help**T287**lex_item_choice**None**7**conduce>> films or songs of any time be <<recognized**T8**Spelling**None**11**recongnised>> in the whole world <<if they are not available without**T7**Absence_explanation**None**7**without>> #DELETE#8#charging any fee.
Although the idea of <<copying and sharing music and films freely**T289**Standard**None**42**freely copying and sharing music and films>> seems to be very attractive, <<it**T9**Capitalisation**None**2**It>> cannot be ignored that to create art is someoneâ€™s job and he or she earns for living this way. Pirate copies make them <<lose**T10**Spelling**None**5**loose>> their money regardless how much a producer or a musician earns.
<<Taking everything that was mentioned into account,**T12**Punctuation**None**49**Taking into account everything that was mentioned>> it can be concluded that despite the fact that copyright legislation is very important as it protects producers and musicians, it should not be so straightforward and regard copying as a crime. Measures should be taken to make laws concerning the copyright not so strict and harsh.
