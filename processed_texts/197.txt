<<Nowadays**T1**Spelling**None**7**Nowdays>> music and film production is highly developed. The huge investments <<are made in**T313**Word_choice**None**11**are made to>> <<creating that content**T2**Transitive**None**24**creating of that content>>. Some people do not want to pay for that content. When they get <<an illegal copy**T4**Articles**None**12**illegal copy>>, they <<steal money from**T316**Prepositional_verb**None**14**steal money of>> <<the creators**T317**Articles**None**8**creators>>. I think those people should be <<punished**T320**lex_item_choice**None**10**restricted>>.
First of all, when someone <<creates**T306**Agreement_errors**None**6**create>> some <<content**T5**Spelling**None**7**contant>>, that is his own <<property**T7**lex_item_choice**None**7**privicy>>. <<Then**T324**Punctuation**None**5**Then,>> that <<man**T322**Spelling**None**3**men>> should be <<rewarded**T326**lex_item_choice**None**8**regarded>> for his work. <<The money he will get will be used for creating new content.**T9**Punctuation**None**59**The money he will get will be used for creating new content>> <<For example,**T10**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> <<a gifted musician**T328**Articles**None**19**the gifted musician>> <<creates**T331**Lack_par_constr**None**7**created>> <<an album**T44**Articles**None**6**alboum>>, and his music is highly rated, people like it. <<In this case**T330**Linking_device**None**4**But,>> <<the author**T310**Articles**None**6**author>> <<does not**T44**Agreement_errors**None**5**donot>> get any money for his <<album**T14**Spelling**None**6**alboum>>, and he <<loses**T15**Agreement_errors**None**4**lose>> <<the incentive**T16**Articles**None**9**incentive>> to create <<the next part**T333**Articles**None**9**next part>>. <<People will be unable to listen to another album**T335**Punctuation**None**54**People will be unable to listen to another albumalbum,>> <<because**T20**Spelling**None**7**becouse>> they <<didn't**T21**Spelling**None**5**didâ€™t>> pay for <<the first album**T22**Articles**None**11**first album>> and just downloaded it for free.
<<Secondly, copying of information without payment is restricted by the law.**T26**Punctuation**None**73**Secondly, copying of information without payment is restricted by the law>> If people do not consider <<this**T343**Determiners**None**4**that>> law <<obligatory**T27**lex_item_choice**None**9**necessery>>, <<other laws**T29**Articles**None**14**the other laws>> will not <<make**T31**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> any <<sense**T30**Spelling**None**5**sence>> for them. For example, that will lead to anarchy and life will be worse. <<Moreover**T32**Spelling**None**9**More over>>, <<illegal**T33**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> coping stops <<the development**T44**Articles**None**11**development>> of culture. Musicians <<don't**T35**Spelling**None**4**dont>> <<want**T36**Spelling**None**4**wand>> to create <<anything**T37**Spelling**None**7**anythig>> <<because**T38**Spelling**None**7**becouse>> it will be stolen. <<Society will degrodate.**T39**Punctuation**None**22**Society will degrodate>>
To sum up, <<illegal**T40**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> coping of <<films**T41**Spelling**None**6**fillms>> and music #DELETE#9#and films <<poses**T44**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> <<a danger**T349**Articles**None**6**danger>> not only for creators <<, but**T311**Punctuation**None**3**but>> for consumers too. Also that stops <<the development**T351**Articles**None**11**development>> of our society<<, and**T44**Punctuation**None**5**. and>> causes its degradation.
