Nowadays, there is uncountable number of producers, who spend their money on making movies and much more musicans, who want to show their music to the whole world. They have lots of dificulties on their road. But the maine of them is internet piracy. Downloading illegal copies by ordinary people leeds producers and musicans to loosing grate amounts of money. Of course, grated number of them think that people, who doesn’d buy the original discs should be punished because they are thefs.

First of all, I should notice that intellectual property, such as movie or musical composition, is still a property, that belongs to the person who made it. That’s why creators have they rights to earn money from selling copies of their arts. And internet piracy is a theft, because hundred millions dollars, that creators can borrow, are lost and people gets this arts for free

But there is another opinion: if producers and musicans want their arts to be famous, especially music composition, then they have to share it everywere, including internet. Also I should add that in XXI century no one is buying discs, because gagets can’t support them. So, I suppose, musicans should earn their money on live-shows, concerts and merch, and film producers on cinema and advertisment. If you doesn’t alloud your art to be shown on the internet, you can’t get such fame and oportunity to earn money.

In conclusion, I want to say, that both opinions has they right to exist. But, I disagree with punishment for Internet piracy, because anyway it helps producers and musicans to make their arts famous and after that to earn money on concerts and live-shows.
