But they forget that these files are illegal copies, and creators of <<the originals**T46**Articles**None**13**original ones>> lose a lot of money because of <<speading these copies**T10**Absence_explanation**None**2**it>>. There were a lot of <<attempts**T11**lex_item_choice**None**7**tryings>> to find a way<< how**T12**Punctuation**None**5**, how>> to stop downloading of pirate copies <<on**T14**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the global Web**T13**Articles**None**10**global Web>>, but all of them were <<unsuccessful**T16**Category_confusion**None**13**unsuccesfully>>.
There is a <<popular**T17**lex_item_choice**None**4**huge>> opinion that sharing illegal copies of films and music should be punished<<,**T18**Punctuation**Dependent_change**1**.>> <<firstly**T19**Spelling**Dependent_change**7**Firstly>>, because of great financial <<losses**T20**Derivation**None**5**losts>> which it causes. Most people <<are sure**T21**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**sure>> that paying a huge amount of money to creators or <<locking those who use pirate copies in jail**T22**Absence_explanation**None**15**locking in jail>> for a long period will stop people from copying files. <<But**T23**Punctuation**None**4**But,>> it seems to me, this practice will be failed. First of all, there are millions of people <<who download**T24**Confusion_of_structures**None**15**who downloading>> illegal copies from the <<Web**T25**Capitalisation**None**3**web>> everyday. It is quite impossible to find and punish everyone. Even if government <<tried**T26**Tense_choice**None**9**would try>> to find just those people who download it, it seems to be <<unsuccessful**T27**Spelling**None**13**unsuccessfull>> too. <<My opinion is that**T28**Absence_comp_sent**None**15**My opinion that>> the best way <<to solve**T29**Confusion_of_structures**Parallel_construction**8**of solve>> this problem is <<to give**T30**Lack_par_constr**Parallel_construction**6**giving>> people an opportunity to have an access to films and music for <<a quite small fee**T46**Articles**None**20**quite little payment>>. <<Nowadays there is a lot of examples of how it works**T36**Standard**None**66**There is a lot of examples nowadays of how it worksof how it works>>. <<iTunes**T37**Spelling**None**6**ITunes>> or Netflix give an access to their users<< but**T38**Punctuation**None**5**, but>> ask them for a small annual or monthly fee. <<So**T39**Punctuation**None**3**So,>> <<an audience**T40**Articles**None**8**audience>> can watch films and serials, listen to music, and don’t have <<great losses**T43**Articles**None**14**a great losses>> <<of**T42**Prepositions**None**2**in>> money. Also, because of growing audience of <<these**T44**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> services, authors and creators <<save**T45**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> their money too.
In conclusion, there is no doubt that it’s important to stop sharing pirate versions of files on the Internet. But punishment is not the answer, and there are <<other**T47**Often_confused**None**7**another>> ways of solving <<this problem**T46**Determiners**None**9**a problem>>.
