It is cimmonly believed that all around the world small local businesses are being replaced with large, multinational brand.
However, some people consider that this development is not outweigh the drawbacks.
First of all, this process does not allow the small companies to exist or to work properly. Obviously, It is immensely challeging to create a local business, because the bigger companies have much more opprtunities and as usual destroy small ones.Therefore, there are less and less those who want to star their own local business.
this prosess dimolishs the all opportunities to do it. Neverthe less, the goverments provides special policy to protect local business so they can not disappear at all.
On the other hand, the development of large, multinational brand provides really wide range of products.
Moreover, it's hardly feasible to imagine that something that you bought in that company is not made by high-qualified workers because it has really amasing quantity. So if large companies stop working, dozens o humans will be without really wonderful, fasionable and well-maked products.
Finally, i'd like to say that the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages.
As small local shops and companies are not preferable by the vast majority of people.
