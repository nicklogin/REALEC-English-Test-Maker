There has been a dispute on the topic<< whether**T8**Punctuation**None**9**, whether>> humanity should spend money on social problems instead of exploring <<space**T10**Articles**None**9**the space>>. Some people believe that environmental issues and poverty are more important, but is it really so?
Well, I personally believe that t<<space expeditions**T309**Articles**None**21**the space expeditions>>and researches a<<do not stand**T1**Tense_choice**None**16**are not standing>>in the way of solving everyday problems of the society.
It is common knowledge that governments of#DELETE#14# such states that have space programs often do<<go to**T12**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> lot of ex<<expense**T3**Spelling**None**8**expences>>n<<for**T13**Prepositions**None**2**on>>uilding spacecrafts and supporting space re<<research**T11**Category_confusion**None**11**researching>>cientists.

Moreover, the important thing is that not only sta#DELETE#7#tes' governments do space explorations. There are individual companies that are<<specialise**T18**Voice**None**15**are specialised>> <<in**T19**Prepositions**None**2**on>>olving what people know about the outer space. One of these companies is SpaceX dev<<founded**T311**lex_item_choice**None**9**developed>> Elon Mask. This company hav<<has**T6**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>>ne dos<<dozens**T20**Spelling**None**6**dosens>> experiments on landing a space rocket and has plans to make Mars a place where people can live.

All in all, most people believe that it is useful to learn about how univ<<the universe**T315**Articles**None**8**universe>>ks or just explore new worlds, but all of these things can give humanity a chance to find other races or resources that can <<cannot**T22**Compound_word**None**7**can not>>found on Eart<<the Earth**T23**Articles**None**5**Earth>>e <<Science**T24**Articles**None**11**The science>>the engine that makes people develop and this engine should never be stopped.
