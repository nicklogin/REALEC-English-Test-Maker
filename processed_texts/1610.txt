This essay is <<going**T276**Spelling**None**5**goint>> to <<describe**T277**Spelling**None**8**discribe>> health <<problems**T278**Noun_number**Dependent_change**7**problem>> and <<their**T279**Ref_device**Dependent_change**3**its>> probable solution.
First of all, the heart problem is a danger of people who <<have**T280**Tense_form**None**3**has>> sedentary lifestyle. It is <<obviously**T281**Spelling**None**9**obliously>> that computers and other technologies are <<required**T282**Voice**None**7**require>> to be nearly table or other places.
