In our generations, the <<unfair**T9**Derivation**None**7**unfairy>> <<use**T10**Category_confusion**None**5**usage>> of illegal drugs by <<professional**T35**Prepositions**None**14**professionally>> athletes is becoming more <<widespread than**T36**Punctuation**None**16**widespread, than>> in the XX century. There is <<a dispute**T27**Articles**None**7**dispute>> <<among**T28**Prepositions**None**7**between>> people about punishment for <<those**T29**Determiners**None**5**these>> <<sportsmen**T22**Punctuation**None**11**sportsmens,>> who used it. Some argue that there must be <<a ban**T38**Articles**None**3**ban>> for them for a limited <<period; however,**T32**Punctuation**None**16**period, however,>> <<others**T33**Agreement_errors**None**5**other>> think that ban should be for the rest of their lives. I agree with <<the opinion**T34**Articles**None**7**opinion>>, which is connected with limited period of <<ban; however,**T37**Articles**None**13**ban, however,>> I will discuss both <<positions**T39**Noun_number**None**8**position>> in this essay.
Firstly, it is <<correct**T40**Category_confusion**None**9**correctly>> to say that all <<professional**T41**Category_confusion**None**14**professionally>> athletes have such a great <<responsibility**T42**Category_confusion**None**11**responsible>> for all of their actions, and all of these actions <<provoke**T43**Word_choice**None**4**have>> a <<reaction**T44**Agreement_errors**None**9**reactions>>. For example, for illegal action must be <<a reaction**T45**Articles**None**8**reaction>> from <<the association of athletes**T22**Articles**None**20**athletes association>><< ; however,**T46**Punctuation**None**10**, however,>> all <<cases**T47**Word_choice**None**7**happens>> should be <<analyzed**T48**Voice**None**9**analazing>> <<individually**T51**Word_choice**None**21**in the individual way>>, because all of people are unique. Nonetheless, some may argue that all <<acts**T52**Noun_number**None**3**act>> must be punished <<equally**T53**Suffix**None**6**equaly>>, but they <<do not**T54**Spelling**None**7**don not>> think about <<unique**T55**Derivation**None**6**uniqal>> causes of this <<use**T56**Category_confusion**None**5**usage>> of illegal drugs by someone.
Secondly, all professional athletes <<have connected**T22**Tense_choice**None**13**are connected>> their life with their kind of <<sport and**T59**Punctuation**None**10**sport, and>> their trainings. For example, somebody <<has been training**T60**Tense_form**None**9**trainings>> <<for about 25 years**T61**Prepositions**None**14**about 25 years>> and <<has made**T62**Absence_comp_colloc**None**3**has>> only one mistake in life, <<when**T63**Conjunctions**None**4**then>> illegal drugs were used. Some people may argue that it is cause for the ban for the rest of life. however they <<do not**T25**Spelling**None**7**don not>> think about all traumas, time or power, which are connected with this <<athlete**T26**Punctuation**None**6**athlet>>. I think that this kind of punishment for <<first**T23**Numerals**None**4**once>> <<first usage**T24**Redundant**None**10**time usage>> of illegal drugs is very cruel.
In conclusion, the spread of the <<use**T11**Category_confusion**None**5**usage>> of illegal drugs by <<sportsmen**T6**Noun_number**None**10**sportsmens>> is <<a crucial problem**T7**Articles**None**17**a crucial problem>> nowadays. People have various opinions about punishment for these athletes, somebody <<thinks**T12**Agreement_errors**None**5**think>> that it must be limited and <<others**T13**Agreement_errors**None**5**other>> think that <<such sportsmen**T14**Ref_device**None**2**it>> must <<be banned**T15**Category_confusion**None**6**be ban>> for the rest of <<their life**T16**Ref_device**None**4**life>>. I think that all cases are <<unique**T2**Derivation**None**6**uniqal>> and there can be different <<periods**T3**Noun_number**None**6**period>> of <<ban; however,**T5**Punctuation**None**13**ban, however,>> it must be <<stricter**T17**Word_choice**None**6**harder>> for <<the second**T18**Numerals**None**5**twice>> <<and**T19**Conjunctions**None**2**or>> <<subsequent**T20**Word_choice**None**4**more>> <<times**T21**Noun_number**None**4**time>> <<of using**T22**Prepositions**None**5**using>>.
