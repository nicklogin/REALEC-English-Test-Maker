It is clear that musicians and film producers become victims of <<modern technologies with easy access**T1**Standard**None**31**modern easy access technologies>>. Downloading your favourite film for free or getting a new music album is obviously easy but <<it is an illegal way**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**14**an illegal way>> and <<it leads**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**leads>> to a serious problems. 
How can we deal with this problem? I personally think that people who share <<pirate copies of original**T6**lex_item_choice**None**7**illegal>> music and film files are <<thieves**T11**Spelling**None**8**theviers>>. For example, lets take a look at worldwide news, the company <<Pirate bay**T7**Spelling**None**11**“Pirate bay>> <<have been speading**T49**Tense_choice**None**19**have been spreading>> <<films, books, music for free**T10**Category_confusion**None**24**free films, books, music>>, nowadays the owner of that company is in jail because of illegal sharing copies. <<It is**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**4**It’s>> a great example of <<a bad outcome**T13**Articles**None**11**bad outcome>>. Firstly, we need to support artists, by buying <<a film, CD or DVD**T14**Word_order**None**17**a film or CD, DVD>> we support people who do their job and#DELETE#7#, hence, <<as a result,**T16**Punctuation**None**11**as a result>> <<we do not support crime business and do not help it to grow**T15**Verb_Inf**None**46**not supporting, helping crime business to grow>>. To prevent the <<process**T18**lex_item_choice**None**4**work>> of  lillegal pirate <<copying**T19**Spelling**None**6**coping>> some companies <<have started releasing**T20**Tense_choice**None**17**started releasing>> #DELETE#2#an original <<CDs**T39**Spelling**None**4**CD’s>> only at <<authetical stories**T23**Articles**None**21**the authentic stories>> and some <<have decided**T21**Tense_choice**None**7**decided>> to fight with counterfeit by putting << holographic**T25**Spelling**None**11**galagraghic>> <<stickers**T26**Noun_number**None**7**sticker>> <<on**T50**Prepositions**None**2**in>> production. The fight with counterfeit is crucial, <<if there is any ways to cut off pirates,**T31**Punctuation**None**40**if there is any wayway to cut-of pirates>> we need to support it by <<buying**T51**Spelling**None**5**buing>> original copies. In Russia we have a <<plenty**T32**Spelling**None**6**planty>> amount of groups and people <<that**T33**Ref_device**None**3**who>> fight with such problems. It is important not to only critisize the pirates but to support the authors by <<buying**T34**Spelling**None**5**buing>> real <<CDs**T40**Spelling**None**4**CD’s>>, investing personal money to <<authors**T35**Noun_number**None**6**author>>. 
All in all, the whole problem is <<acute**T36**Spelling**None**6**accute>> and up to date #DELETE#1#-, partly because these days <<in the era of the Internet**T38**Punctuation**None**22**in the era of Internet>> people replace <<CDs**T41**Spelling**None**4**CD’s>> with <<mp3s**T42**Spelling**None**5**mp3’s>> <<, but**T43**Punctuation**None**3**but>> <<, frankly speaking**T44**Punctuation**None**17**frankly speaking,>> I came to the conclusion that we have to fight with all the pirate counterfeit in the most effective ways as #DELETE#2#it possible. It may seem an oldie <<, but**T46**Punctuation**None**3**but>> <<if you pay for every author's job,**T47**Punctuation**None**33**if you pay for every author's job>> the world will <<repay**T49**lex_item_choice**None**5**chair>>.
