All over the world there is a great variety of crimes happening every day and there is no doubt that the rate of crime is increasing dramatically.According to the estimates, particularly the younger generations who commit a crime is on the rise.
In this essay I will try to explain the reasons for the e<<enhancement**T10**Spelling**None**12**enchancement>>of offence rate and offer some solutions.
To begin with, I sould say that in most countries some youngsters can't find a good job.
In some deprieved countries the government is not able to generate job<<workplaces**T11**Compound_word**None**10**job places>>r residents and when people can't find any duty to do they try to get money by other ways such as crime. They sho<<should**T12**Spelling**None**7**shoould>>ep their family with all the essentials and urgent things but they don't have money for that.
Thereby, people and especially the young try to make a fortune with illegal things like drug abuse or burglary and offences.

What is more, the teenagers are too prone to commit a crime because of their friends who may inffluence on them.
Furthemore, some teens don't last their education due to some problems such as family issues. Instead of being at schoold<<school**T13**Spelling**None**7**schoold>>ander during the day in streets with their peers and when they do not have money to buy what they want , teens think about robbery or other staling<<stealing**T9**Spelling**None**7**staling>>es.
These all facts lead to commiting a crime.


There are possible solutions to tackle with<<tackle this problem**T8**Redundant**None**24**tackle with this problem>>ment and parents should do accurate thing for youngsters. The government has to create job places <<workplaces**T7**Compound_word**None**10**job places>>g people can do something to earn money. In terms of parent's duty they must be friend of t<<friends**T5**Noun_number**None**6**friend>>hildren and assist their kids to solve their problmes an<<problems**T6**Spelling**None**8**problmes>> stand by them. At schools teachers also should try to help students when it comes to different issues.
