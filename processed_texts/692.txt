The recent upsurge of crimes has provoked a serious discussion about means of slowing this tendency down. Many people believe that the most effective way is to increase prison sentences; others claim there are better alternatives. From my perspective, I would rather agree with the second group.
On the one hand, making criminals sitting in cells for a longer time might have its benefits. Firstly, people may become more afraid of such serious consequences of their i<<illegal**T3**Spelling**None**7**illigal>>activity. This fact may become a strong remedy for the problem. Moreover, this new rule might reduce the r<<repetitive**T4**Spelling**None**10**repetetive>>crimes because it is highly unlikely for people who h<<have spent**T7**Tense_form**None**10**have spend>>e<<an enormous amount**T8**Articles**None**15**enormous amount>>of time in prison to m<<commit**T9**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>>crimes again.
On the other hand, I be<<believe**T14**Spelling**None**7**beleive>>t is more effective to el<<eliminate**T1**Spelling**None**9**eleminate>>he problem from its root. First of all, due to better education and proper life circumstances the amount of criminals will decline. Schools should develop such qualities as high morality and humanity in children which may result in their future lifeviews. So people with such views will not be able to<<to commit a crime**T10**Redundant_comp**None**33**to commit a crime because of them>>Good economics and level of life will also reduce the need of ma<<committing**T11**lex_item_choice**None**6**making>>rimes. Secondly, I be<<believe**T12**Spelling**None**7**beleive>>overnment should develop high level of citizen co<<consciousness**T13**Spelling**None**12**consiousness>>n people, what also may affect positevely on a discussed problem.
In conclusion, I would say that longer prison sentences, benefical as they are, will not be the best solution to high level of criminality. It is more effective to develop inner con<<conscience**T6**lex_item_choice**None**12**consiousness>>d provide people with proper education and means to live honestly.
