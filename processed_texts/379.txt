The bar chart represents data showing what social networks online adults in the USA prefer to use depending on their age group.

The graph clearly shows that Facebook is the most popular network among people of all ages. People of age from 18 to 29 use it much more frequently than any other presented social network (the percentage accounts for 87%). The similar tendency can be observed in usage of Facebook by people of 30 to 49 years old: the per cent of those using Facebook (73%) is nearly three times bigger th<<than**T2**Often_confused**None**4**then>>f those using Instagram (25%). The figures showing how many of them use LinkedIn are again quite low (31%).

People aged from 50 to 64 tend to use Facebook more often than other networks (63%). The per cent of them using LinkedIn is halved comparing to Facebook and is 30%. A considerably smaller per cent of people of this age use Instagram which is 11%. The same can be said about the people of 65 years old and older: only 6% of those use Instagram. This is pretty explicable as Instagram is a relatively new network. It is worth mentioning that the percentages of people aged from 30 to 49 and from 50 to 64 using LinkedIn are almost equal (31% and 30%).
