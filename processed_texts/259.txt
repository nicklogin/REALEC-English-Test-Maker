<<The modern world**T1**Articles**None**12**Modern world>> has created an <<countless**T2**Formational_affixes**None**10**uncounting>> number of different kinds of entertainment <<, and**T3**Punctuation**None**3**and>> music and film products are among them. However, some people believe they don’t have to pay for it because they can download these files. Personally I am sure that such thieves should be punished, but there is still <<another idea**T5**Articles**Dependent_change**15**an another idea>> of too high prices exists.
First of all, I must say that musicians and film producers spend much money while creating their art products. The price includes the time authors had to spend to find an idea, the time and other kind of resources they had to spend to reach the aim of starting their project and money to record and sell everything that musicians and producers have made. Moreover, artists spend years and years to become those people they are and to be able to create something extraordinary. That is why people who steal the results of such <<enourmous work**T7**Articles**None**17**an enourmous work>> should be punished. Finally, illegal copying of discs is punished by the law (however, it is too difficult to find internet “pirates”).
<<On the other hand**T8**lex_part_choice**None**17**On the other hand>>, although I believe it is unfair to steal the property of other owners, the price of discs is too high. As a result, people who cannot afford it have to download pirate copies. Furthermore, it should be said that the disc costs almost nothing <<, whereas to buy a film,**T10**Punctuation**None**21**whereas to buy a film>> people have to pay hundreds of rubbles. It is much better to have a rest and visit <<a cinema**T11**Articles**None**5**cinem>>a using <<this**T12**Agreement_errors**None**5**these>> money. That is why I think authors of music and film art may be guilty of losing their money because of illegal downloading.
In conclusion, I <<would**T13**Spelling**None**6**woudld>> like to say that I am 75% sure that a theft should be followed by punishment, but at the same time I am 25% sure that it is unfair to ask <<for such a high price**T14**Prepositions**None**17**such a high price>>.
