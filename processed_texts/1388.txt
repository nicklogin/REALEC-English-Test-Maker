A lot of people are sure that modern <<technologies**T1**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>, which are becoming more and more popular, may be <<the cause**T2**Articles**None**5**cause>> for <<the rising**T3**Articles**None**6**rising>> of <<health problems**T5**lex_item_choice**None**33**the numbers of problems in health>>.

Overall, <<this**T6**Capitalisation**None**4**This>> statment appeared not very far, but soon became rather popular <<in**T7**Prepositions**None**7**between>> <<society**T8**lex_item_choice**None**6**social>>. Many people, including researchers, believe that different types of technology affect on human health and such <<diseases**T9**lex_item_choice**None**7**illness>> like cancer appeared because of <<them**T10**Ref_device**None**5**their>>. <<As**T11**Spelling**None**2**Us>> for me, I think that <<point of view**T12**lex_item_choice**None**7**opinion>> <<cannot**T13**Spelling**None**7**can not>> be absolutely wrong. I am sure that modern <<technologies**T14**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> have some influence on our life and health. For instance, there are <<many**T16**lex_item_choice**None**8**a lot of>> <<situations**T15**Noun_number**None**9**situation>> when people have <<a headache**T50**Articles**None**7**headack>> because of phones, computers and other. Also, it is <<easy**T19**lex_item_choice**None**8**possible>> to notice that <<in**T22**Prepositions**None**7**between>> young people there are many boys and girls with not <<a very good eyesight**T21**Articles**None**18**very good eyesight>>. It <<means**T23**Tense_form**None**7**is mean>> that despite <<the usefulness**T24**Articles**None**10**usefulness>> of <<different**T25**Category_confusion**None**10**difference>> <<gadgets**T26**Spelling**None**7**gafgets>>, they are able to bring some <<damage**T27**lex_item_choice**None**4**harm>> for health.

 On the other hand, I am not sure that all of <<our**T28**lex_item_choice**None**2**us>> <<problems with healt**T30**Prepositions**None**18**problems in health>> <<go**T31**Voice**None**8**are goes>> from <<technologies**T32**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>. Overall, <<people**T33**lex_item_choice**None**5**human>> have not reduced <<diseases**T34**lex_item_choice**None**7**illness>> <<before**T35**Spelling**None**6**be for>> the widespread using of gadgets. In contrast, I believe that a lot of modern <<technologies**T36**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> <<are**T37**lex_item_choice**None**6**can be>> able to help to solve any <<health**T38**Category_confusion**None**7**healthy>> problem. For example, there are a lot of <<scientists**T39**Noun_number**None**9**scientist>> who #DELETE#8#nowadays have <<a crucial research**T41**Articles**None**16**crucial research>> about cancer and another important <<diseases**T42**lex_item_choice**None**7**illness>>.

In general, it is possible to say, that it is very important to use modern <<technologies**T44**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> #DELETE#16#the we have more right, because despite their useful <<functions**T45**Noun_number**None**8**function>>, they may be not very good for peopleâ€™s life. However, new <<technologies**T46**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> <<can**T48**lex_item_choice**None**11**are able to>> give us <<an opportunity**T47**Articles**None**11**opportunity>> to go on the next step in reducing different crucial issues, like <<health problems**T49**Confusion_of_structures**None**19**problems in healthy>>. So, I believe that people can use modern <<technologies**T50**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> more useful.
