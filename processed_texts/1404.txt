The <<diagram**T1**Spelling**None**6**giaram>> charts illustrate the <<proportions**T32**Noun_number**None**6**number>> of goods <<transported by**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**by>> two <<transportation**T5**Often_confused**None**10**transports>> <<systems**T6**Noun_number**None**6**system>>: rail and road in different European countries.

On the first diagram we can see that the <<proportion**T7**lex_item_choice**None**6**number>> of metals was the biggest <<, it**T32**Ref_device**None**5**there>> was 35 percent. But <<these**T10**Ref_device**None**8**the same>> goods have significant decrease <<in the transportation by road**T11**Absence_explanation**None**7**by road>> <<, there**T12**Punctuation**None**5**there>> was 11%. Also, the <<proportion**T13**lex_item_choice**None**6**number>> of machinery <<decreased**T14**Voice**None**13**was decreased>> <<by 10 percent**T15**Prepositions**None**13**on 10 percent>> by rail and it became 2 percent. <<However,**T16**Punctuation**None**7**However>> <<chemicals**T17**Noun_number**None**8**chemical>> and manufactured goods remained unchanged between <<the rail and road transportations**T18**lex_item_choice**None**33**good transported by rail and road>>. <<The chemicals' proportion**T19**Absence_explanation**None**8**Chemical>> <<changed**T32**Voice**None**13**was increased>> from 11 percent to 16 percent. And manufactured goods <<increased**T22**Voice**None**13**was increased>> from 25 percent to 28 percent. <<Moreover,**T23**Punctuation**None**8**Moreover>> the percentage of food <<products**T24**Noun_number**None**7**product>> <<significantly increased**T25**Voice**None**27**was significantly increased>> <<by 29%**T27**Prepositions**None**6**on 29%>> from <<rail to road charts**T28**Absence_explanation**None**12**rail to road>> and it became 30 per cent. The diagram charts represent the system and how it <<influenced**T30**Transitive**None**17**was influenced on>> <<the transported goods**T32**Word_order**None**17**goods transported>>.
