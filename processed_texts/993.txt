I agree musicians and film producers lose huge amount of money every year from illegal pirat copies. Many peoples copying and share pirat films, music, clips in the internet. Some peoples download original files and buyy discs in “Disc markets”.

But I dont know why people dont downloods original version music, films clips in the Internet: Why? In Internet many original version films. I dont love pirate copies, it is not normal. It’is not original, it is cheap version. Yuck!

People must learning download original products in internent, than buying pirates version on the “Disc market’s”. People very stupid now.

In additionol some producers lost money every year from angry pirate disc’s.

But people very clear. I support “Clear peoples”, becouse it is cool idea downlooding films, music, clips files and, build pirate version for other stupid people.

I know 4 boys. They have big studio, “BiG PIRATES STUDIO”. Furthermore this boy every every day “make money”. In they studio have “SALE DAY”, and younger people bough this pairotes discs with love films, clips, music bands,  and nore.

This boys very rich and clever. They know over city. This “Pirates studio” very famous between social groups.
