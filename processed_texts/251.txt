One of the issues, discussed nowadays, is the spreading of pirate copies of music and films on the <<Internet**T1**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. It is widely considered that such copying is illegal and should be punished. Still, <<there**T2**Spelling**None**3**the>> are some opposing points of view, that should be taken into account.
On the one hand, enormous amounts of money are not only spent by musicians and film producers on making media product, but also lost from pirate copying. In other words, media-makers don’t get as much money as they deserve for selling their product, but also <<bear**T3**lex_item_choice**None**6**suffer>> high costs of production. These costs should be at least partly covered by the price paid by consumers. Otherwise, such uncontrolled copying can lead to crisis in media industry. That means<< that**T4**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<the quantity and quality**T5**Articles**None**20**quantity and quality>> of media products would <<be reduced**T6**Voice**None**6**reduce>> if only rich media-producers could afford to create <<a unit**T7**Articles**None**4**unit>> of media. For this reason, it is better to punish people<< who share and download pirate copies**T8**Defining**None**38**, who share and download pirate copies>>.
On the other hand, media-makers make a lot of money for presentation of their media-products at a public places (like concerts, cinemas etc). Still, many people don’t earn enough money to spend them on pieces of culture. Unfortunately, <<the majorities of households**T11**Possessive**None**38**the majoritiesmajorities of households>> income is only enough to buy <<goods**T12**Noun_number**None**4**good>> of <<the first need**T13**Articles**None**10**first need>>, like food and <<clothes**T14**Derivation**None**6**cloths>>. If free downloading is strictly <<forbidden**T15**Spelling**None**8**forbiden>>, the cultural degradation of the society <<may begin**T16**Verb_Bare_Inf**None**9**may began>>. People, especially young <<ones**T17**Noun_number**None**3**one>>, need an access to free media products in order to discover the world, life and their personality.
To conclude, I consider that pirate copying should not be punished, as cultural development <<of**T18**Spelling**None**1**f>> the society must <<be a priority**T19**lex_part_choice**None**14**be in priority>> before some amount of money <<is lost**T20**Verb_part**None**4**lost>> by another media producer.
