The graphs illustrate the comparisons of the temperature in two countries with radically different <<climates**T1**Noun_number**None**7**climate>>. On these graphs <<maximal and minimal temperatures during the year are fixed**T2**Word_order**None**58**are fixed maximal and minimal temperatures during the year>>. 

Generally speaking, <<the indicators**T4**Articles**None**10**indicators>> of maximum and minimum situate closely to each other, it means that over the period of one month <<the temperature**T5**Articles**None**11**temperature>> <<remains**T6**Agreement_errors**None**6**remain>> almost steady. As for <<the weather**T7**Articles**None**7**weather>> in Yakutsk, it always changes. The hotest time in the year is July, but the coldest <<periods**T8**Noun_number**Dependent_change**6**period>> <<are**T9**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> December and January. <<The datas**T10**Articles**None**5**Datas>> of Rio de Janeiro look differently. <<The temperature**T11**Articles**None**11**Temperature>> in Brazil <<remains**T12**Agreement_errors**None**6**remain>> stable with some fluctuations<< within whole year**T13**Punctuation**None**19**, within whole year>>. <<A more detailed view**T14**Articles**None**18**More detailed view>> reveals that <<the peak**T18**Spelling**None**4**pick>> of temperature in Russia is about 25*C, whereas in Rio the highest point is near to 30*C. However, <<there are much more differences between the minimal indicators in these countries**T17**Confusion_of_structures**None**65**difference between minimal indicators in this countries much more>>. In Yakutsk <<the temperature decrease**T18**Articles**None**11**temperature>> decrease to approximately â€“ 40*C, but in Rio de Janeiro it is never less than 17*C.
