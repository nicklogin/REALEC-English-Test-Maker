Nowadays, it is a huge problem for the film and music industries that many people use their products <<, such as songs, films, serials,**T2**Punctuation**None**29**such as songs, films, serials>> <<illegaly**T3**Category_confusion**None**7**illegal>> just by downloading these files from special sites. Some people think that there should be a law which <<prohibits**T4**lex_item_choice**None**8**punishes>> the illegal copying of music and films.
I partly agree with this point of view. On the one hand, musicians and film makers spend a lot of time and money on producing something interesting and unusual for the auditory. Creators as all other workers should have some salary for their work. It can be gathered by buying music <<on**T5**Spelling**None**2**en>> CDs and films to the <<cinema**T6**Spelling**None**6**cenema>> centres. <<But because of the power of Internet and programmers who can find such songs and films,**T7**Punctuation**None**86**But because of the power of Internet and programmers who can find such songs and films>> the musicians and film <<producers**T8**Spelling**None**8**produces>> <<lose**T9**Spelling**None**5**loose>> the ability to get some money for their work and <<sleepless**T10**Category_confusion**None**9**sleepness>> nights in office. It means that programmers and people who download files are <<on**T11**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the side of <<a criminal**T12**Articles**None**8**criminal>> <<, and**T13**Punctuation**None**3**and>> they should be punished for that.
On the other hand, there a lot of people who can not allow themselves to buy legal music and films because of their high price. Sources with intertainment content require huge payment per month. In Apple music, iTunes, Google music almost all music is too expensive that people decide not to buy it but, maybe, buy goods for family instead of <<a new song**T14**Articles**None**8**new song>>. What is more, tickets in the <<cinemas**T15**Spelling**None**7**cenemas>> also <<are**T16**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> too expensive for ordinary people. <<Maybe because of these facts,**T17**Punctuation**None**28**Maybe because of these facts>> people choose not to buy <<an original copy**T18**Articles**None**13**original copy>> but to <<download it**T19**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**download>> for free.
<<I personally think that copying and sharing is a theft but not so awful like killing people.**T20**Punctuation**None**89**I personally think that copying and sharing is a theft but not so awful as killing people>> Music and film <<producers**T21**Spelling**None**8**produces>> should adjust a price (make it lower) for products of this industry in order to solve this problem of illegal copying.
