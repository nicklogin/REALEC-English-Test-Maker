There is a popular point of view that nowadays there are more crimes committed by teenagers.

To my mind, that st<<statement**T1**Spelling**None**10**statenment>>s partly true. I see it as a result of lack of morality in our everyday life. Due to the fact that teens do not see a good example of be<<behaviour**T2**Spelling**None**8**behavour>>they start to act as "cool" and "bad guys" from movies. Thus, they pretend to be worse than they actually are. The second reason may be the social status of their family. It is not a surprise that a poor person may steal so<<someone's**T3**Spelling**None**9**someone`s>>allet to buy some food for himself or for his familly. These circumstances shall also be taken into account. The third reason is<<concerns**T4**Voice**None**12**is concerned>>he parents of such deviant teenagers. I be<<believe**T12**Spelling**None**6**belive>>hat they do not pay en<<enough attention**T6**Redundant**None**19**enough of attention>>o what their children do in their spare time and to what they are keen on. Sometimes teens just wa<<want to attract**T13**Absence_explanation**None**4**want>>ore attention to themselves and do everything not to be ignored.

To solve the problem of teen<<teenagers**T7**Spelling**None**10**teenagers`>>minality parents and teachers have to work together. I may give some pieces of advice to them. Firstly, parents shall control what their children watch in t<<on the Internet**T14**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>>on the TV to reduce the bad influence. Moreover, teachers may show good films such as "One flight over the cock<<cockoo's**T8**Spelling**None**8**cockoo`s>>t" in school to educate the teens. Besi<<Besides**T9**lex_item_choice**None**6**Beside>>rents shall give a good example of how to behave to their children. You can not blame your children for being rude if you are also rude. Sometimes young people need more love from their parents and it can be helped just by being nice to them. Finally, teachers shall help<<help teenagers to become**T15**Verb_Inf**None**23**help teenagers becoming>>ter and not just punish them for every mistake that they make.

To sum up, the problem of teenag<<teenagers**T10**Spelling**None**11**teenagers`s>>nality comes from different places. The te<<Teenagers**T11**Articles**None**13**The teenagers>>ot only ones to blame. To be honest, I would <<want**T16**lex_item_choice**None**10**would like>>ociety to assist deviant teens with socializing. I hope that one day there will be less criminals among the young people.
