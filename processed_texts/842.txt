It is considered among a wealth of people that today youngsters do more crime actions than they used to. It is rather challenging and thought-provoking issue which should be taken into account by parents and teachers.

I suppose that an abundance of factors can cause this problem. Firstly, many children receive poor attention from their parents today be<<, because**T3**Punctuation**None**7**because>>oth parents usually work full time no#DELETE#8#wadays. They would like to earn money, however, they forget about attention and care which their child needs.

Children and teenagers are getting used to cruelty and violence through el<<computer**T6**lex_item_choice**None**9**electonic>>ames. The boundaries between games and reality begin to blur. That is why they transfer actions from games into real life.
