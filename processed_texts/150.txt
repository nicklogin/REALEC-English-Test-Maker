More and more young people are #DELETE#8#stunding on the slippery slope of crime. They <<do not**T2**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don't>> want to earn money by themselves, thinking that <<it is**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**3**its>> easier to rob a person or even kill him or her for money. Parents and teachers should prevent it by promoting and establishing <<the right values**T4**Articles**None**12**right values>> among children and teenagers. Adults should also encourage <<the young generation**T5**Articles**None**16**young generation>> to build a successful career.
It is very hard for young people to find their place in the modern world. And the thought that they can get money <<without working**T6**Gerund_phrase**None**12**without work>> seems very appealing to them. So, instead of studying at #DELETE#3#the schools and universities, they start, for example, selling drugs.
This lack of motivation to live a decent life <<stems from**T8**lex_item_choice**None**13**boils down to>> #DELETE#1#a <<imporper**T9**Prefix**None**10**not proper>> <<their impoper upbringing**T11**lex_item_choice**None**27**raising them as a children.>> And this is <<their parents' mistake**T13**Possessive**None**26**a mistake of their parents>> #DELETE#13#and children. Parents and teachers should explain why it is morally wrong to lead a life of crime. They should spend more time on bringing them up and teaching them the right values.
Adults should also <<help the young generation build**T14**Verb_object_bare**None**34**help the young generation to build>> a career. There would be no incentives to commit crimes, if earning money by a decent work was as easy as earning money by <<committing illegal acts**T20**Inappropriate_register**None**21**doing illegal things.>> Of course, that cannot be reached, but we should <<strive to achieve that**T16**Absence_comp_colloc**None**15**strive to that.>> Parents and teachers should encourage young people in their endeavors and <<not discourage**T17**Redundant**None**17**not to discourage>> them from reaching their dreams. 
It is very important to determine the causes of #DELETE#3#the increased crime rate among young people, so we can find a better solution to the problem.
