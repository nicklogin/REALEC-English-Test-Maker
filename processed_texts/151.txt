In this graph wesee percentage of online adults in the USA who use Facebook, Instagram and Linked In.
Obviously Facebook is most popular in eachof the age categories more than half of online adults use this Social Network, and only 13% of 18-29 category - most active in Internet don't use it. In Instagram by contrast we don't much olter auditory, majority of users, 53% is under so, and we may see the huge drop in the next age categories. But LinkedIn network for work show us other tendency: middle-aged adults more active than youngest adults, moreover percentage of younges and oldest categories are equial
So here we have an obvious pattern and can describe Facebook as must-have network to communicate with relatives and know latest news, Instagram which only used by young people between themselves for fun. And the LinkedIn with serious job-searching content which may be too serious for young category  but very actual for active workers.
