There is no doubt that honest competition <<in**T1**Spelling**None**2**is>> sport has become an urgent issue in recent years. Some people claim that usage of illegal drugs has to be punished for a fixed period of time, while others tend to think that a dishonest athlete has no right to compete without any time <<limits**T5**Spelling**None**7**limints>>. <<In this essay,**T2**Punctuation**None**13**In this essay>> both views will be examined carefully.
First of all, usage of illegal drugs is not a crime and sometimes <<it is**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**is>> not even a choice. Some medicaments that treat certain diseases simply coincide with those that are illegal. An athlete may not have been aware of this fact. <<In such cases,**T7**Punctuation**None**13**In such cases>> a ban from professional competing for a year or two seems to be acceptable. One should also keep in mind that this is not a serious crime and not letting to compete forever might be a too severe punishment. As long as an athlete can prove that not all of his/her achievements <<have depended**T8**Tense_choice**None**6**depend>> on using illegal drugs, he/she must not be punished forever.
On the other hand, dishonesty in competition provokes many controvercies. The honour of an athlete cannot be overestimated, since it takes origin from the Ancient Olympic times. This is a solid ground of a professional competition. Provided that every participant sweared to compete honestly, the everlasting ban does not seem to be an unfair punishment. It also has to be mentioned that such restrictment concerns only a professional career of a sportsmen, it does not cover amateur sphere, so the sport and even some sort of competition <<remain**T9**Agreement_errors**None**7**remains>> available for an athlete.
To conclude, I would like to state that while usage of illegal drugs <<concerns**T4**Tense_form**None**9**concernes>> serious ethic and moral aspects, such as honour and honesty, it is crucial to remember that each case has its special conditions and punishment should go in conjunction with all of them. <<In spite of this,**T10**Punctuation**None**16**In spite of this>> there are other people who claim that dishonest competition has no excuses and has to be punished forever.
