Nowadays there are a lot of disputes over <<advantages and disadvantages**T2**lex_item_choice**None**13**pros and cons>> of illegal music and <<film**T18**Coherence**None**5**music>> copying. Some people believe that all the content on the Internet should be free and <<available**T3**Spelling**None**9**avialible>> to everyone, while their opponents argue that illegal copying can be <<regarded**T19**lex_item_choice**None**7**claimed>> as a theft or at least as a kind of crime.
Actually, the opinion that pirate copying should be punished is really widespread around the world. People who support that position usually provide three main arguments. Firstly, illegal copying affects the amount of money that people of art earn every day. It <<reduces**T26**Spelling**None**6**reduse>> their income so people become less motivated to work <<in**T20**Prepositions**None**2**at>> the sphere of arts. Secondly, it is bad for the <<state economies**T9**lex_item_choice**None**21**governments economies>> because <<illegal sharing**T6**Articles**None**19**the illegal sharing>> of that content cannot be <<taxed**T7**Category_confusion**None**7**taxated>>. Thirdly, these illegal actions can undermine the <<ethics**T21**lex_item_choice**None**10**moral side>> of modern societies. It means that nowadays some people start to think that something “illegal” can sometimes be a good (or normal) thing. It happens because people <<come across**T22**lex_item_choice**None**4**face>> illegal <<copying**T23**lex_item_choice**None**9**spreading>> almost every day <<, which**T14**Coordinate**None**4**what>> makes <<the process of pirating**T16**Ref_device**None**2**it>> normal for them, therefore <<governments**T10**Articles**None**15**the governments>> want to stop pirate copying <<immediately**T11**Spelling**None**10**immediatly>>.
However, there is an opposite point of view on this issue. Some people think that every person in the world should be able to find <<any content**T24**lex_item_choice**None**15**all the content>> he or <<she**T12**Category_confusion**None**3**her>> needs for free. Advocates of this opinion say that some people just cannot <<afford to buy**T13**Verb_Inf**None**13**afford buying>> films and music while they need it to increase their levels of culture and education.
In my opinion, every work should be rewarded so it is not fair that film producers, actors <<or**T25**Conjunctions**None**3**and>> musicians <<lose**T17**Spelling**None**5**loose>> some part of their money because of pirate copies. However, I believe that <<all educational movies**T26**Articles**None**26**all the educational movies>> and pieces of art should be free as it is important for the level of culture worldwide.
