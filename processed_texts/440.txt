Nowadays some people suggest a system which will provide a guaranteed monthly sum of money for everyone. This sum will not depend on any other income you receive and will be the same for everyone. However, can advantages of this system outweigh the disadvantages?
In my opinion, such system has more disadvantages that advantages for two reasons. Firstly, this system will not lead to significant changes in lives of middle-class and upper-class. For example, people who earned a lot of money from elsewhere will continue to earn their money, but this system will just give them an additional income. Other people, who do not earn much money, will also have an additional income, but this will not change their position in the society. We can see that the situation will remain the same for ordinary people, but the rich will get richer. In addition to this argument, it is obvious that prices will grow with the introducing of this system, so it will not make people’s lives much better, but will just spend government’s money.
Secondly, this system can damage the interest in finding a job. If people earn money doing nothing, why should they work? This problem will definitely occur with this system. The level of unemployment will grow dramatically but the main problem will be that people will become too lazy to work and will not be willing to find a job. This will damage the economy.
In conclusion, I would like to say that this system may have some advantages as it gives people more income and makes their lives a bit better. However, its drawbacks will bring more problems than advantages benefits.
