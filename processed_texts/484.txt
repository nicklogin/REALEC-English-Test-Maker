There is a tendency that people prefer American and British films to their local ones. There are some reasons for this, among them is <<the lack**T346**Articles**None**4**lack>> of governmental financial support.

There is a proverb in Latin "panem et circenses" th<<which says that people need food and shows**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**39**, which says people need food and shows>> that is still true nowadays. British and especially American films are far more spectacular than any other movies (there is only one probable ex<<exception**T1**Spelling**None**8**exeption>> Indian Bo<<Bollywood**T2**Spelling**None**8**Bolywood>> For people it is much more interesting to watch some action movie with guns, cars and explosions li<<, something like**T20**Punctuation**None**4**like>>ast and Furious. Fortunately, today we can find more films with deep meaning and ones that can be very inspiring, but general tendency shows that simple action movies are the most popular. They are so exciting due to expensive special effects, consequently, it is difficult to do<<make**T348**Often_confused**None**2**do>>t<<them**T10**Ref_device**None**2**it>>ithout money.

Secondly, one can produce a good movie easier when there is a fi<<financial support**T14**Articles**None**19**a financial support>>m gove<<the government**T15**Articles**None**10**government>>nius directors and scen<<script writers**T16**lex_item_choice**None**10**scenarists>>oubtedly exis<<exist in other countries**T17**Absence_explanation**None**5**exist>> they cannot do anything because of lack<<the lack of money**T11**Articles**None**13**lack of money>>lywood is a stable financial system but, for instance, in Russia it is extremely hard to find a fi<<financial support**T18**Articles**None**19**a financial support>> a non-standard movie even if you are famous like Renata Litvinova. Russian government give<<gives**T19**Agreement_errors**None**4**give>>ancial support but unfortunately this system doesn't work well yet. The key problem is the evaluation of qual<<the quality of films**T3**Articles**None**16**quality of films>>be supported. The government should probably give<<not give more money**T4**Standard**None**19**give not more money>>t to m<<support more valuable films**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**22**to more valuable films>>tead of giving it to most<<more**T7**Comparative_adj**None**4**most>>ous directors with standard plots.

Taking everything into account, it could be said that the key problems are tastes<<the tastes**T350**Articles**None**6**tastes>>ople preferring expensive simple movies with much action and th<<, and**T20**Punctuation**None**3**and>>overnment that should support really valuable local films instead of popular meaningless movies.
