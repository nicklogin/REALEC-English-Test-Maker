Modern technologies <<have changed**T1**Tense_choice**None**7**changes>> our life, it <<has become**T2**Tense_choice**None**7**becames>> faster and easier with them, but new problems appear and <<a significant part**T3**Articles**None**16**significant part>> of them <<is**T4**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> related to health. This essay states some examples of that diseases, explains the reasons of their appearance and <<gives**T5**Agreement_errors**None**4**give>> <<a recommendation**T6**Articles**None**14**recommendation>> how to decrease the negative influence of modern technology. 

To begin this talk about <<the problems**T7**Articles**None**8**problems>> caused by technologies, the ecology must be <<taken into account**T8**lex_item_choice**None**8**reminded>>. Today science has plenty of studies how to improve ecology and care about it, but harmful technologies <<are still used**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**still used>> <<, and**T11**Punctuation**Dependent_change**3**and>> <<they appear**T10**Absence_comp_sent**Dependent_change**6**appear>> again. <<Also,**T12**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> modern gadgets <<harm**T13**lex_item_choice**None**11**are weaking>> <<humans' eyes**T14**Articles**None**16**the human’s eyes>>, headphones – their hearing, microwaves, which are <<produced**T16**lex_item_choice**None**5**going>> <<by**T17**Prepositions**None**4**from>> every electronic machine, destroy <<the neuro system and cardio system**T18**Articles**None**30**neuro system and cardio system>> of our body. Technologies also <<set**T21**Agreement_errors**None**4**sets>> modern lifestyle, <<which**T22**Spelling**None**5**whice>> <<is**T23**lex_item_choice**None**7**remains>> sitting <<while working**T24**Confusion_of_structures**None**4**work>> or running fast and <<eating**T25**Tense_choice**None**3**eat>> unhealthy food<<. Of course**T26**Punctuation**None**12**, Of course,>> cars are one of  the #DELETE#4#from prospects of modern technology, and they often <<become**T29**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> <<the reason**T30**Articles**None**8**a reason>> of <<deaths**T31**Spelling**None**5**deads>> in car encidents. 

In that case the reasonable question “what can we do?” must be answered. I think the positive effect of modernization is less than <<negative effects described above**T32**Standard**None**32**described above negative effects>>. Not only <<the physical health**T34**Articles**None**15**physical health>> <<is**T33**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> weakened, our principles and values <<have been**T35**Tense_choice**None**4**were>> changed and cursed. We must return to our traditions, and <<whan**T36**Conjunctions**None**5**which>> is most significant – to our religion. It is a spiritual state, it is that <<common**T37**lex_item_choice**None**6**united>> thing, which we must protect, because if we <<lose**T38**Conditionals**None**4**lost>> it, our society will be defeated. 

To sum up, we could not <<evolve**T39**lex_item_choice**None**10**developing>> without problems and it is too difficult to reduce <<them**T40**Ref_device**None**3**it,>> so we should stop and go back to traditions and to <<the church**T41**Articles**None**6**church>>. It is not the only correct decision, but it should work if we <<are scared**T42**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**scared>> to <<develop**T43**Tense_choice**None**10**developing>> <<side by side with**T44**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**by side>> negative effects which could appear.
