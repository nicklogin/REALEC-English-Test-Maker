The diagram illustrates alterations in development of the print and eBook market in several countries in two periods (2014 and 2018).
The most noticeable feature of the data is that development of print market in all countries (<<except**T1**lex_item_choice**None**8**excluded>> Germany) will become lower by 2018; whereas eBook trade <<increases**T2**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**8**increase>> slowly, but surely. Although, it is clearly seen that USA has the <<highest**T4**Superlative_adj**None**9**most high>> percentage (10,5) in print market among other countries.
It can be observed, that in 3 countries the amount of money for <<printed**T5**Category_confusion**None**5**print>> book market is <<getting**T6**Tense_form**None**3**get>> lower. In <<the USA**T7**Articles**None**3**USA>> this number will fall from 10,5 to 8,5 billion dollars by 2018. It is interesting that percentage of money which <<are spent**T8**Voice**None**7**spended>> on print books in <<Germany**T9**Capitalisation**None**7**germany>> leveled off for all time. In <<China**T10**Capitalisation**None**5**china>> this number remained fairly stable (from 4,8 to 4,2), like as in UK (from 2,6 to 2).
Money spending for eBook market will soar in <<the USA**T11**Articles**None**3**USA>> (from 5,5 billion dollars to 8,5), but in other countries these changes are not very significant (Germany 1 â€“ 1;5 billion dollars), China: from 0,5 to 1; and <<the UK**T12**Articles**None**2**UK>> from 1,8 to 2,3.)
It can be <<seen**T13**Tense_form**None**6**seemed>>, that the amount of money <<spendings**T14**Noun_number**None**8**spending>> for development the print and eBook market in <<the USA**T15**Articles**None**3**USA>> is <<higher**T16**Comparative_adj**None**11**more higher>> in other countries (10,5 and 5,5 in 2014; 7,5 and 8,5 in 2018), so, <<the USA**T17**Articles**None**3**USA>> <<stands**T18**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**stand>> <<on**T20**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the top of all discripts.
