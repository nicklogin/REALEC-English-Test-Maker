There is an opinion that countries <<should not**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn’t>> produce the food for import and do it only for <<its own population**T2**Absence_explanation**None**14**own population>>. I think, there are more disadvantages than benefits of this idea. Firstly, some products like bananas and qiwi cannot be grown by the natural way in countries such as Canada or Russia. Of course, this food <<is**T3**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> very popular. Therefore a large quality of it must be imported. The second reason against this opinion is economic processes. It is <<an important**T4**Articles**None**18**the important part>> of economy of a lot of countries. It would be deteriorated, if <<the import**T5**Articles**None**6**import>> stopped. This process gives a lot of money to <<the governments**T6**Articles**None**11**governments>> of countries that they can <<spend on**T7**Prepositional_verb**None**9**spend for>> improving <<the quality**T8**Articles**None**9**a quality>> of life of their <<populations**T9**Noun_number**None**10**population>>. <<That is**T10**Inappropriate_register**None**6**That’s>> why I disagree with this statement. Of course, there are some advantages of this politic, but there are numerous disadvantages. Import is <<an importatnt part**T12**Articles**None**19**important from part>> of economy.
