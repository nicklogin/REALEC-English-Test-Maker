Lets consider an issue#DELETE#1#, that nowadays more crimes are being committed by young people than ever before; think of reasons for <<that,**T2**Punctuation**None**4**that>> and possible solutions to the problem.
The main reason for that can be spread of Internet and similar technologies, development of virtual reality where things are less controlled than in the real world.
Firstly, we should notice, that nowadays young people have access to much larger amounts of information than ever before. That results in fact, that they can easily get lot of know-how of committing crimes and, moreover, can be influenced by criminals, who <<want**T3**Agreement_errors**None**5**wants>> to achieve their own purposes by doing dirty <<things**T4**lex_part_choice**None**5**thing>> with <<someone else's**T5**Absence_comp_colloc**None**15**someone’s other>> hands. It became easier for young people to get in <<wrong" companies**T6**Articles**None**21**the “wrong” companies>>, to contact criminals and be influenced by some stories and <<promises**T7**Spelling**None**8**promices>> of <<a better life**T8**Articles**None**11**better life>>. Real examples can be found in different groups in Vkontakte, where criminal HRs are working.
Consequently, we should mention another reason for that – lack#DELETE#1#, or inadequate amount of control. Government, public services are still unfamiliar with <<the Internet**T28**Articles**None**8**internet>>, it is often <<hard**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**uneasy>> for old people to learn how to use <<its full potential**T13**Redundant_comp**None**21**its in full potential>>. Examples of it are in families too – children usually know much more about <<computers**T15**lex_part_choice**None**8**computer>> then their parents. The <<latter**T16**Often_confused**None**4**last>> can physically control, if their son is at home at night, but miss many connections that he makes <<on the Internet**T20**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>> and <<especially**T21**Spelling**None**10**expecially>> in social networks.
As a summary, I would like to offer several solutions to that problem – parents should care more about social activity of their child <<on the Internet**T24**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>> and most of all – about his contacts there. If he chats with strange <<40-year-old**T25**Derivation**None**12**40 years old>> man – that’s a bad signal. If he visits <<prohibited**T26**lex_item_choice**None**10**restricted>> forums via TOR – that is a very bad signal <<, too**T27**Punctuation**None**3**too>>. Police should also pay more attention to what is happening <<on the Internet**T28**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>> – many crimes, if not all, have their roots there.
