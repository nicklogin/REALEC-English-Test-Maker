 Some people think that countries need to make food only for their <<citizens**T1**Noun_number**None**7**citizen>> and <<do not**T2**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> import food for other countries. I disagree with that opinion. I think that countries should produce more <<food**T3**Noun_number**None**5**foods>> and import it. 

Firstly, I think that import #DELETE#2#it is always <<an advantage**T5**Articles**None**9**advantage>>. #DELETE#29#Because, for the proced food, other countries pay some money to <<the country**T7**Articles**None**7**country>> which sells that food. Money is always benefit for <<a country**T33**Articles**None**7**contrie>>, due to that <<the more money a country has**T10**Confusion_of_structures**None**23**much money countrie has>>, the more improvements it can make. For instance, government can improve roads, build new houses for people or new medical centres, but <<to do that**T11**lex_item_choice**None**9**for these>> government <<needs**T12**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> money, and it can get it from <<importing**T13**Category_confusion**None**6**import>> food.

Secondly, all countries have different <<climats**T14**Noun_number**None**6**climat>> and different opportunities to produce some food. For example, in Russia it would be difficult to <<grow**T15**Category_confusion**None**6**growth>> bananas. So <<it is**T16**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**it>> <<easier**T17**Comparative_adj**None**11**most easier>> to export from other countries. However, if all countries <<do not**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> import foods, some countries stay without some food, and it is awful. People need various food, because from different food you can get more vitamins than from one type of food. <<Also,**T19**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> some countries <<are not**T20**Voice**None**5**don’t>> located near the <<sea**T21**Spelling**None**3**sed>>, so they <<would not**T22**Inappropriate_register**None**7**would’t>> have fish, if all <<countries**T23**Spelling**None**8**contrues>> import as little as possible. Some people say that fish is <<a very useful product**T24**Articles**None**19**very useful product>>, and without fish some people can <<become ill**T25**lex_item_choice**None**8**have ill>>. Also, if something happened, <<like**T26**Spelling**None**4**live>> <<a big fire**T27**Articles**None**8**big fire>> which <<destroys**T28**Agreement_errors**None**7**destroy>> forest and many fields, countries which make more food than their own population eats, always have food, which it <<cannot**T29**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> import and use in difficult <<situations**T30**Noun_number**None**9**situation>>. But if countries produce not enough food, then people can <<dye**T31**Tense_choice**None**5**dying>> if many fields would be destroyed. 

To sum up, I want to say that countries should produce food not only for their own people but <<for**T32**Prepositions**None**4**from>> import. Because all countries would have different food, and it is important for <<citizens**T33**Possessive**None**7**citizen>> health. Besides, countries would get much money due to they import food.
