It is a well-known fact that with the time developing more and more crimes are committed by teenagers. In this essay possible causes and solutions will be described.
The first reason for this could be that, unfortunately, nowadays we have a lot of movies and computer games where people misbehave and do wrong things. I am sure that this fact influences children's mind and make them to break law. For example, last year there was an accident with a boy who killed his father and as it was known after, he did it only because he saw it in a movie. Fortunately, there is a solution for this problem. Adults, especially teachers and parents, should look carefully after their children's way of entertaining: what they watch, what games they play etc.
The following cause for this is domestic violence. It is not a secret that nowadays much more families start to beat their "lovely" children. After that kids become more violence and cruel. For this situation everything depends on parents, so the solution is warm and grateful relationships among the family members. Moreover, I think that teachers at schools should also give lessons on the topic about behavior in the family and society on the whole. For instance, in my school we had such lessons where we could watch some social advertisements about violent children and their awful and even scaring families and it influenced our minds, we did not want to become as they were.
To sum up, I would like to say that children's behavior is exactly depends on adults and what measures they take.
