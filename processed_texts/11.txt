Musicians and filmmakers lose a lot of money every year because of pirate industry. <<The question**T1**lex_item_choice**None**11**The problem>> is <<if**T2**lex_item_choice**None**2**it>> it is <<a theft**T3**Articles**None**9**the theft>> and <<should it be punished or not**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**18**be punished or not>>.
<<Personally, I think**T5**Standard**None**20**I, personally, think>> that copying and sharing music or films on the internet <<are**T37**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> <<a kind of theft**T6**Articles**None**13**kind of theft>>. Firstly, all people need to protect <<the law**T12**Articles**None**3**law>> and <<obey it**T11**lex_item_choice**None**11**be under it>>, <<Modern authorship system**T65**Capitalisation**Dependent_change**35**the modern rules of author’s rights>> <<prevents**T65**Agreement_errors**None**11**try to stop>> #DELETE#2#it <<copying and sharing the content**T65**Absence_explanation**None**21**(copying and sharing)>>, that is why people who copy films and music are <<thieves**T8**lex_item_choice**None**6**thefts>>. Secondly, musicians and film producers <<spend**T9**Tense_choice**None**5**spent>> a lot of money and time to <<create**T22**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> their films and <<music compositions**T10**lex_item_choice**None**6**audios>>, and when they do not <<earn**T23**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> money from <<selling**T24**lex_item_choice**None**5**using>> it <<to**T25**Prepositions**None**2**by>> other people <<, it**T26**Punctuation**None**2**it>> is <<not fair**T27**lex_item_choice**None**10**dishonesty>>. Thirdly, people who copy and share films and old music <<do**T65**Tense_choice**None**4**made>> it only for <<money;**T30**Punctuation**None**6**money,>> <<it is as if**T33**lex_item_choice**None**13**it looks like>> <<they have stolen**T31**lex_item_choice**None**5**theft>> from <<your**T32**Pronouns**None**3**you>> house in order to sell it on the black market.
<<But**T34**Punctuation**None**4**But,>> there is <<an opposite opinion**T35**Articles**None**16**opposite opinion>>, that copying and sharing are not theft. To begin with, people who copy and share films and audios are like Robin Hoods of <<the modern world**T38**Articles**None**12**modern world>>, because usually producers and musicians are rich, and they do not lose a lot while their audios and movies <<are uploaded**T65**Tense_choice**None**4**sent>> <<on**T41**Prepositions**None**2**to>> <<the internet**T42**Articles**None**8**internet>>, but poor people <<can**T43**Tense_choice**None**5**could>> <<use it for free instead**T44**Absence_explanation**None**6**use it>>. Moreover, the internet is <<an "alternative" world**T47**Articles**None**26**a free “alternative” world>> where not all laws are acting, there is <<free information**T49**Articles**None**18**a free information>> about everything in the world there <<, and**T48**Punctuation**None**3**and>> music and films #DELETE#3#are <<should also be free**T51**Standard**None**19**also should be free>>.
In conclusion, I would like to <<say**T52**Punctuation**None**4**say,>> that despite two opposite <<opinions**T53**Spelling**None**9**oppinions>> the position of people who say that copying and sharing <<are**T54**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> <<a theft**T55**Articles**None**9**the theft>> is more <<reasoned**T56**lex_item_choice**None**5**clear>> because in order to live in <<a free society**T59**Articles**None**12**free society>>, with <<an opportunity**T58**Articles**None**11**opportunity>> to have affair wages you need to <<obey the law**T60**lex_item_choice**None**16**be under the law>>, and <<the law**T61**Articles**None**3**law>> <<says**T63**Punctuation**None**5**said,>> that it is <<a kind of theft**T65**Articles**None**12**kind of foul>>.
