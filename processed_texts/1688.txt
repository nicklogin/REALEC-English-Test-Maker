Nowadays a lot of people are sure that professional sportsmen who have taken illegal drugs are to be banned for a <<certain**T1**lex_item_choice**None**8**concrete>> period of time. However, <<others**T14**Agreement_errors**None**5**other>> think that such athletes must be dismissed forever. This essay will discuss both points of view.
I can say without any hesitation that professional sportsmen, caught <<while**T15**Prepositions**None**4**with>> taking illegal drugs, should not be banned for <<their**T16**Determiners**None**1**a>> whole career. Firstly, a lot of professional athletes are really young and the end of their career may look like the end of their lives. Sportsmen are the people<< who dedicate all their time,**T12**Punctuation**None**28**, who devote all their time,>> all their skills and all their life to <<practicing sports**T17**Word_choice**None**9**trainings>>. If they are banned forever, they <<will not**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**5**won't>> be able to do something instead of sport. Secondly, banning for a limited period of time will, from my point of view, help sportsmen to realize their mistake. Banning from competing <<professionally**T8**Spelling**None**14**frofessionally>> for athletes is like <<imprisonment**T9**Word_choice**None**17**sending to prison>> for ordinary people. The main idea of it is to <<rehabilitate**T10**Derivation**None**11**reabelatize>>, to correct the mistake. Finally, sportsmen <<may even not be aware**T7**Voice**None**21**may even not be aware>> of the fact that they are taking illegal drugs. For instance, it happened with Maria Sharapova. She was just taking medicine including banned meldony to <<be cured**T18**Voice**None**4**cure>>. She <<did not**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn't>> know that it was <<not legal**T19**lex_item_choice**None**6**banned>>. As the result, she was banned for 2 years.
Nevertheless, some people suppose that professonal athletes who have taken illegal drugs ought to be banned for the rest of their lives. They say that such sportsmen <<ruin**T4**Spelling**None**3**run>> the spirit and honor of competing. What is more, such people believe that it is <<dishonest**T5**Derivation**None**10**dishonored>> to their <<opponents**T20**Noun_number**None**8**opponent>>. Cheating athletes must be banned forever to set a good example to other sportsmen.
In conclusion, I should <<again stress**T21**Standard**None**12**stress again>> that I am in favor of banning athletes from competing professionally for a certain period of time. However, the issue of punishment for taking illegal drugs is rather controversial and I do not think that there will be a 100% agreement with one of represented points of view.
