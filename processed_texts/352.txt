Nowadays a lot of <<discussions**T1**Noun_number**None**10**discussion>> <<are**T10**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> given to the issue of sport. Some people believe that watching sports is useless, while others cannot imagine their life without it. There are two sides of one coin and in this essay <<i**T11**Capitalisation**None**1**i>> <<am going to**T12**Tense_choice**None**4**will>> give my personal opinion towards this topic. The thing is that there are people, who are not into sports. They <<neither**T2**Conjunctions**None**13**do not either>> participate in it, nor <<watch**T3**Lack_par_constr**None**8**watching>> it. <<There are**T4**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**There>> also those who just prefer not to waste their time watching sports events, no matter on TV or live, for the reason that they like to play sport games themselves. Some people say that watching sports is immensely boring and they hardly fall asleep, while watching it. Despite the fact that there are those who do not see any sense in sports, there is a huge number of people, who are keen on sport and who cannot live without it. For example, football fans, who roar on the stadiums, supporting their team. Such people see the sense of their life in sport, for them watching sports is like a breath of fresh air. There are also a lot of people who watch sports just for fun, they turn on the TV <<on**T5**Spelling**None**3**ion>> <<a**T6**Articles**None**3**the>> sport channel just to have a rest from everyday routine and relax. As for myself, <<i**T7**Capitalisation**None**1**i>> cannot say that watching sports is a waste of time, as I am crazy about sport since childhood. It is an unforgettable feeling when the team which you root for scores the goal, or when tennis player whom you support wins the match. <<In my personal point of view,**T9**Punctuation**None**28**In my personal point of view>> people, who hate watching sports events are strange, for the reason that I cannot imagine my life without it.
