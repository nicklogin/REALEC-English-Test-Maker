This essay will be about <<the negative influence**T5**Articles**None**20**a negative influence>> of modern technology on human health. 

<<From**T6**Prepositions**None**2**In>> my point of view, new innovations can be very harmful for <<people**T7**lex_item_choice**None**5**human>>. To begin with, sitting for a long time in your telephone or computer can be very dangerous for eyes. Scientists believe that <<spending**T8**Tense_choice**None**5**spend>> <<a lot of time**T9**lex_item_choice**None**4**long>> time watching TV, playing computer games or chatting online in telephone can be harmful for human vision.

There are a lot of biomedical technologies in modern world that can safe people from different diseases.
