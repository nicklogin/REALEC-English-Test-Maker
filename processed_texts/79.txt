Nowadays a lot of people like to download  music or films <<for free**T1**lex_item_choice**None**6**freely>> from the Internet. However, others think that <<it**T2**Often_confused**None**4**this>> is a crime <<, and**T3**Punctuation**None**3**and>> these people should answer #DELETE#14#before the law for their actions.
The first point of view suggests that <<downloading**T5**Spelling**None**11**doenloading>> music or films <<for free**T6**lex_item_choice**None**6**freely>> is <<a normal thing**T7**Articles**None**12**normal thing>>. Their first argument is that they don’t want to spend their money <<on**T8**Spelling**None**2**or>> things<< that**T10**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they can get without paying e.g. music, films. The second argument is that <<often**T12**Suffix**None**7**oftenly>> one can find in the internet things<< that**T14**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> one can’t buy, for example, old publications or old films and music, etc. #DELETE#3#the <<Last**T16**Capitalisation**None**4**last>> argument is that sometimes one <<needs**T17**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> to get something <<immediately**T19**lex_item_choice**None**9**right now>>, but can’t buy it in shops or <<on**T18**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet. Working on your course work, you might need documental films, but <<often**T20**Suffix**None**7**oftenly>> they are not for sale.
The second group of people <<disagrees**T21**Agreement_errors**None**8**disagree>> with it. Firstly, they argue that musicians and film-makers spend a lot of money on their products <<, and**T22**Punctuation**None**3**and>> it’s <<unfair**T23**lex_item_choice**None**9**unjustice>> not to pay for it. For example, a lot of singers nowadays ask their fans to buy legal copies of new albums or download it from official websites for <<free**T24**Spelling**None**3**fee>>. Secondly, they say that it’s <<a crime**T25**lex_item_choice**None**7**a exome>>, because there is a law about protection of author’s rights in <<a wide range**T26**Articles**None**14**the wide range>> of countries. As one know, there’re a lot of precedents, when singer or film-maker won the processes against websites, where their products could be downloaded freely.
To sum up, the society is divided <<in**T28**Prepositions**None**2**on>> two <<groups**T30**lex_item_choice**None**8**sections>> <<because of**T29**Prepositions**None**5**about>> this issue: the first one says that downloading things <<for free**T31**lex_item_choice**None**6**freely>> shouldn’t be charged <<badly**T32**Category_confusion**None**3**bad>>, however, the second one argues that it is amoral and illegal and it should be <<persecuted**T33**lex_item_choice**None**8**punished>>. Unfortunately, this question <<is still being discussed**T35**lex_item_choice**None**18**is still debatable>>.
