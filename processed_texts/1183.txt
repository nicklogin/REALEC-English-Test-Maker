Today a lot of people discuss the controversial dilemma of food transitioning. Many <<different**T1**Spelling**None**7**dispect>> arguments has been said for positive and negative sides of view. I will examine some of <<these**T2**Ref_device**None**4**this>> arguments and give my own opinion â€“ should countries share and sell their food to each other or not.

First of all, it is obvious that <<the export**T3**Articles**None**6**export>> of nourishment and another needs has good influence on developing <<the economy**T4**Articles**None**7**economy>> of every country, <<they relationships, friendly policy**T5**Punctuation**None**35**their relationships friendly policy>> and so on. This is how <<the world**T7**Articles**None**5**world>> developed in <<the first place**T8**Articles**None**13**a first place>>. The second benefit of producing food not only for your own population, but for others too is that it works both ways, therefore people will eat more kinds of meals, they will have <<the better**T9**lex_item_choice**None**4**more>> variety of food on their tables, more vitamins, try new taste <<experiences**T10**Noun_number**None**10**experience>>. 

The breakdowns of food selling outside the country exist too. For instance, with products (fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, etc) diseases spread. Without food moving between countries there will be more isolation and many lives will be saved. <<The next disadvantage**T11**Articles**None**17**Next disadvantage>> of importing food a lot is that government <<need to support**T12**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**13**needs support>> its own fermers by giving them more places on markets, so it should be partly free from oversed sellers. 

Considering all views on this problem, I believe that the <<main point**T13**lex_item_choice**None**5**topic>> is right. Countries should build their <<policy of**T14**Prepositions**None**9**policy in>> import and export carefully, so their economy would stay unharmed and could develop properly.
