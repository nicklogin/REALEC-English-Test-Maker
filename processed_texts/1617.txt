The charts show <<which**T200**lex_item_choice**None**4**what>> goods were transported by rail and by road in Eastern <<European**T201**Suffix**None**6**Europe>> countries in 2008.
As can be seen from the charts, the main difference <<concerns**T202**Tense_form**None**7**concern>> metals and food products. 35% of metals <<were transported**T204**Tense_choice**None**15**are transported>> by rail, which almost three times more than by road. On the opposite, food products <<tended**T205**Tense_choice**None**4**tend>> to be transported by road mostly, and the difference <<was**T206**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> <<similar to that**T207**lex_item_choice**None**4**like>> in the previous case - 30% against 11%. As for <<chemicals**T208**Articles**None**13**the chemicals>> and manufactured goods, the difference <<was**T210**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> insignificant: the same rates for the rail and the road transportation, which are 16% and 28% (<<respectively**T209**lex_item_choice**None**11**accordingly>> for mentioned goods). Non-metallic minerals <<were transported**T211**Tense_choice**None**15**are transported>> by road mostly: only one third of them <<was**T213**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> transported by rail. The one more discernible particularity of <<goods**T214**Countable_uncountable**None**4**good>> transportation in Eastern Europe in 2008 <<was connected**T215**lex_item_choice**None**6**refers>> to machinery goods. Only 2% of them <<were**T216**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> transported by road, while 12% - by rail.
<<In conclusion,**T217**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> it <<is worth noting**T218**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**is worth>> that particularities and means of transport for transportation very often depend on goods and their characteristics.
