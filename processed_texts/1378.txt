Nowadays many people <<claim**T1**lex_item_choice**None**8**maintain>> that the worldwide usage of modern technology affects people’s health in a negative way: causing a number of problems.

Obviously, there are a lot of diseases caused by computer technologies <<that are deeply involved**T2**Absence_explanation**None**15**deeply involved>> in our lives. These technologies might have a bad impact on a person’s eyes, heart, <<the quality**T3**Articles**None**7**quality>> of sleep and a number of other organs and vital processes. On the one hand, such difficulties could be solved by prohibiting the computer technologies in <<daily**T4**lex_item_choice**None**8**everyday>> life (banning the production of Bluetooth-supporting lightning, doors and pots). Moreover, using computers and digital screens for the <<educational**T5**lex_item_choice**None**8**learning>> <<purpose**T6**lex_item_choice**None**7**process>> could be banned too. However, such a solution might stop the technological progress and make our lives less comfortable.

So, on the other hand, the <<technologies**T7**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> might be accepted and considered as a part of modern everyday life and <<they should be made**T8**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**made>> more eco-friendly. That could be reached by using solar energy and <<demostrating**T9**Gerund_phrase**None**11**demonstrate>> all the data on a retina-screen, which is less harmful for eyes. Nevertheless, it is impossible to reconstruct all the aspects of our modern life without using as much technology as today, so it would be much easier to make <<technologies**T10**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> more healthy, and at the same time continue to develop its technical characteristics. 

In conclusion, I would like to say that the widespread use of modern technology has a huge disadvantages which <<affect**T11**Tense_choice**None**12**is affecting>> the users’ health in a harmful way, however, there is a variety of disputable solutions of this problem that could be taken into <<the consideration**T12**Articles**None**13**consideration>> by ordinary people and by huge concerns <<managing**T13**Spelling**None**8**managins>> the rechines production as well.
