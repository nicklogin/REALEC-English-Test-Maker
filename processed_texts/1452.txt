I agree with that position. <<I think that**T1**Punctuation**None**13**I think, that>> this strategy can <<help to upgrade**T2**Prepositions**None**12**help upgrade>> <<the economical situation**T3**Articles**None**20**economical situation>> in some countries. But I have one disagreement. As for me, any country must produce the food for import and not in small values, cause it <<helps**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**support>> <<the nation to get**T5**Standard**None**17**to the nation get>> more money. Let me talk about it.

Firstly, yeah, <<it is**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> very wonderful to produce products that their own population eats. This thing must split all of #DELETE#2#of countries. <<It is not interesting when**T10**Punctuation**None**27**It is not interesting, when>> you can eat everything everywhere. All nations will be different. By the way, we can place some markets of cafes with international food, but reduce their own. And countries can reduce <<the amount of money spent**T11**lex_item_choice**None**14**spending money>> on ‘unpopular’ food in <<a current place**T12**Articles**None**13**current place>>.

In other way of thinking, countries must not produce the food only for their population. Everyone must produce products for import, cause <<it is so comfortable**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**17**it so comfortable>> and cool to get money from other <<nations that are**T14**Defining**None**17**nations, that are>> <<interested**T15**Voice**None**11**interesting>> in <<the kitchen**T16**Articles**None**9**‘kitchen’>> of <<their**T17**Pronouns**None**4**your>> homeside. But <<the amount**T18**lex_item_choice**None**5**count>> of that food must be normal, not little, not huge. That move <<helps us to upgrade**T19**Prepositions**None**16**helps us upgrade>> <<the economical situation**T20**Articles**None**20**economical situation>> in any country. It <<helps**T21**Agreement_errors**None**4**help>> to upgrade life level <<for some nations**T22**Prepositions**None**15**in some nations>> in Africa and in south America.

As clearly seen, <<this statement is not so correct**T23**Absence_comp_sent**None**29**this statement not so correct>>, as for me. And <<I think that**T24**Punctuation**None**13**I think, that>> there is #DELETE#7#kind of <<an interesting idea**T25**Articles**None**16**interesting idea>>, but <<I will**T27**Inappropriate_register**None**4**I’ll>> correct some ‘mistakes’ there. It is so interesting to split countries in that way, but <<we must understand that**T28**Punctuation**None**24**we must understand, that>> import – <<a huge part**T30**Articles**None**13**one huge part>> of any country and everyone must keep it <<in mind**T31**Spelling**None**7**on mide>>.
