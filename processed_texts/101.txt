The industry of entertainment has a lot of problems with people who use illegal ways to copy films or songs. There is a popular opinion that such pirate activities should be prohibited and a strict punishment for this crime should be <<imposed**T32**lex_item_choice**None**7**created>>.
Modern technologies <<have really developed to the extent when**T27**Tense_choice**None**20**are really developed>><< with**T35**Punctuation**None**6**. With>> <<their help**T36**Confusion_of_structures**None**16**the help of them>> people can do everything on the internet and such progress <<causes**T1**Agreement_errors**None**5**cause>> <<huge problems**T2**Articles**None**15**a huge problems>> for <<creators of films or songs**T3**Articles**None**25**a films or songs creators>>. First of all, musicians and producers do not get their money and have a lot of <<losses**T4**lex_item_choice**None**5**costs>>. If creators lose money, they <<will not have**T5**Tense_choice**None**14**would not have>> an opportunity to pay #DELETE#3#for <<the actors**T7**Articles**None**6**actors>> and other people<< who**T37**Defining**None**5**, who>> were involved in the process of <<making a film, clip or song**T38**Standard**None**25**film, clip or song making>>. <<Secondly**T8**Category_confusion**None**9**Secondary>>, investors are not interested in <<projects**T11**lex_item_choice**None**10**activities>><< where**T10**Defining**None**7**, where>> they <<invest**T39**lex_item_choice**None**3**pay>> <<huge amounts**T9**Articles**None**14**a huge amounts>> of money and other people just “steal” their production and money. Investors prefer to <<avoid**T12**Spelling**None**6**avoied>> such spheras where pirates can use special programmes and steal everything so <<easily**T13**Category_confusion**None**4**easy>>.
Another <<significant**T14**Spelling**None**11**significand>> reason why pirates are dangerous for <<the industry of entertainment**T15**Articles**None**25**industry of entertainment>> and producers or <<musicians**T16**Spelling**None**9**musitions>> is that actors or singers <<are not motivated**T17**Voice**None**19**do not be motivated>> to take part in activities <<from**T41**Prepositions**None**5**after>> <<which**T18**lex_item_choice**None**4**that>> they will not get <<famous**T19**lex_item_choice**None**16**respect, glorial>>. Pirates usually copy <<films**T20**Noun_number**None**4**film>> or songs in a bad <<quality;**T21**Punctuation**None**8**quality.>> because of this <<the work of singers or actors cannot be recognised as good,**T22**Confusion_of_structures**None**61**other cannot recognised as good the work of singers or actors>> and <<they**T23**Spelling**None**3**tne>> do not want to work in this situation.
To sum up, pirates are really <<dangerous**T26**Spelling**None**10**dangerouse>> to film producers and song creators<<,**T28**Punctuation**Dependent_change**1**.>> <<and**T29**Capitalisation**Dependent_change**3**And>> their <<activities**T27**Spelling**None**8**activits>> should be punished.
