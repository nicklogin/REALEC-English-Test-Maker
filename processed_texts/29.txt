One of the widely discussed issues nowadays <<is**T2**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>>: <<making**T3**lex_item_choice**None**5**doing>> pirate copies <<of**T4**Prepositions**None**2**on>> music and films. #DELETE#2#In <<These**T6**Capitalisation**None**5**these>> days <<spending time on different websites on the Internet**T7**Standard**None**52**the Internet and spending time on different websites>> <<has**T11**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> become an essential part <<of**T12**Prepositions**None**2**in>> our life. There are two different <<points of view**T13**Absence_comp_colloc**None**6**points>> <<on**T14**Prepositions**None**2**of>> <<downloading films or music illegally**T96**Standard**None**34**illegal downloading films or music>> and importance of punishment for them. In this essay <<will be explained**T17**Tense_choice**None**15**will be explain>> some reasons of agreement or disagreement with this problem and will be given some examples for better evidence.
Firstly, it can be noted that musicians and film producers have author’s patent on their <<products**T18**Noun_number**None**7**product>> because it <<were**T19**Agreement_errors**None**3**was>> their <<innovations**T20**Noun_number**None**10**innovation>>. <<Consequently,**T21**Category_confusion**None**15**In consequences>> they lose a lot of money from illegal pirate copies. It is wrong because people must have <<salaries**T23**Noun_number**None**8**a salary>> from their <<jobs**T22**Noun_number**None**3**job>>. A good <<illustration**T24**lex_item_choice**None**4**case>> of it is a typical situation on <<a factory**T25**Articles**None**11**the factory>> <<, where**T96**Punctuation**None**5**where>> every worker <<has**T28**lex_item_choice**None**4**want>> to <<receive**T29**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> <<salary**T30**Articles**None**8**a salary>> <<, because**T31**Punctuation**None**7**because>> he or she <<goes to the factory every day**T33**Standard**None**29**every day goes to the factory>> and <<does**T34**Agreement_errors**None**2**do>> <<his**T35**Agreement_errors**None**5**their>> <<job**T36**lex_item_choice**None**4**work>>. <<Considering this point of view,**T38**Punctuation**None**30**Considering this point of view>> <<we can understand**T39**Voice**None**20**it can be understood>> <<, why**T40**Punctuation**None**3**why>> people who <<make**T43**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> illegal pirate copies should be punished.
On the other hand, there are some reasons why people disagree with punishing #DELETE#3#for people <<who**T42**Conjunctions**None**5**which>> <<make**T44**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> illegal pirate copies. It can be proved by financial opportunities of <<the majority of population**T46**Prepositional_noun**None**23**the majority population>> in the <<major**T47**lex_item_choice**None**6**“lion”>> part of countries <<of**T48**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the whole world. For instance, <<a citizen**T49**Articles**None**7**citizen>> from <<Eastern European’s countries**T50**Articles**None**32**the Eastern European’s countries>> has <<a salary of only 150 or 200 dollars**T54**Prepositions**None**32**a salary only 150 or 200 dollars>> per <<month**T53**Noun_number**None**6**months>>. <<At the same time**T55**Absence_comp_colloc**None**13**The same time>>, people <<want to spend**T56**Verb_Inf**None**16**want to spending>> their free time <<in a more interesting way**T57**Absence_explanation**None**16**more interesting>> and try to relax with music or film. Unfortunately, <<an original disk**T58**Articles**None**13**original disk>> with music or film <<costs**T59**Tense_choice**None**9**have cost>> about 15-20 dollars #DELETE#8#per disk. In this situation people don’t have any <<opportunities to buy**T61**Prepositional_noun**None**21**opportunities for buy>> <<an original disk**T63**Articles**None**13**original disk>>. <<As a result**T64**Prepositions**None**9**In result>>, it can be seen that we have <<a demand for**T66**Prepositional_noun**None**11**a demand on>> music/film from poor people and we <<have to support**T68**Verb_Inf**None**12**have support>> <<downloading all that you want on the Internet for free**T69**Standard**None**54**for free downloading all that you want on the Internet>>.
<<Taking everything mentioned above into account,**T75**Punctuation**None**46**Taking everything mentioned above into account>> I <<want to point out**T76**Verb_Inf**None**14**want point out>> that <<the problem of illegal pirate copies**T79**Prepositional_noun**None**38**the problem with illegal pirate copies>> <<needs**T80**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> to have <<another**T81**lex_item_choice**None**5**other>> solution, because punishment <<will only provoke**T82**Standard**None**17**only will provoke>> to find new ways <<of downloading favourite films or music for free**T84**Standard**None**44**of free downloading favourite films or music>>. Also, <<to my mind**T88**lex_item_choice**None**10**in my view>>, I <<absolutely**T87**Category_confusion**None**8**absolute>> disagree with <<punishing people**T89**Prepositions**None**20**punishing for people>> who don’t have any <<opportunities to buy**T90**Prepositional_noun**None**24**opportunities for buying>> <<an original disk**T92**Articles**None**13**original disk>>. Government <<needs**T93**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> to find a new <<solution**T94**lex_item_choice**None**8**decision>>, for example, some charity payments #DELETE#13#or subsidiary.
