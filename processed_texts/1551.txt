The chart illustrates the improvement of book industry in the USA, Germany, China and the UK between 2014 and 2018. It demonstrates that through the years eBooks become more and more popular.
The first table, that depicts the situation in the United States, shows the biggest interest to the electronic books (in 2014 it was only 5,5% and in 2018 it will be 8,5%). As for other countries, the change is not so dramatic. For instance, in Germany and China the number of eBooks has grown only for 0,5%, in the United Kingdom the rise is almost 1%. So, the USA is considered to be the most progressive country in the sphere of electronic devices.
It is quite interesting and even suprising that the market of printed books looks stable. Germany will have the same percentage in 2018 as it has in 2014, China and UK will have a small fall (from 4,8% to 4,2% in China and from 2,6% to 2% in the UK): In the USA the decline is more contrast: from 10,5% to 7,5%. These statistics lead to the fact that people have not stopped reading simple paper books.
To sum up, the developing trend on eBooks can be seen in all four countries. It is caused by the century of technologies and their influence on the society.
