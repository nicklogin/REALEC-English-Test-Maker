Nowadays space exploration has become a very controversial topic. The government tends to spend <<a huge amount**T1**Articles**None**11**huge amount>> of money on bulding new space stations and ships. Some people do not understand the point of this and claim that there are better ways to spend this money. I agree with them but only to a certain extent. In my opinion, it is true that the government should not forget that its main goal is to make people happier and somehow improve their well-being. For example, the government has to think about homeless people, poverty, water pollution, other environmental problems and so on. However, << don't think that it is possible to solve these problems completely one day**T2**Standard**None**76**I don't think that it is possible one day to solve these problems completely>>. That is why, in my opinion, it is important not to stop our development and somehow try to go ahead, to learn something new about this world. Space exploration is a perfect chance for people to work, make new discoveries and evolve. Who knows, maybe in #DELETE#3#the future we will thank our government for the amount of money they spend on this. Of course, countries should not overestimate their income and pay attention to the way the space exploration they are working on influence the lives of people. If <<the population**T3**Articles**None**10**population>> is poor, than space exploration is probably not the best idea right now and the government should concentrate on <<the other things**T5**Articles**None**12**other things>>. To my mind, space exploration is something that rich and powerful countries <<should be thinking**T6**Tense_choice**None**12**should think>> about. In conclusion, <<I would like to add that space exploration is very essential part of our life,**T7**Punctuation**None**77**I would like to add that space exploration is very essential part of our life>> but it needs careful consideration because of the fact that the government has a lot of other things to worry about and if it puts too much effort into the space industry, it might have a huge number of negative consequences for population.
