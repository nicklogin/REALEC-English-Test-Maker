Drugs in sports <<are**T1**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> always a problem. Life of a sportsman nowadays is always lived on the limits of human abilities, so a proper treatment to a sportsman's body including drugs and medicamental treatment is highly neccessary.
Here I think one faces the first problem and this problem is what drugs are illegal and what drugs are not. This line sometimes almost vanishes in our highly medicated world. So I guess this ambivalence is a nice argument for those who <<are in favor**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**in favor>> of limited ban for doping in sport. It is worth saying that apart for the sportsmen themselves, sport industry consists of billions of people, highly professional medical staff included, so it's not so often a sportsman's choice to choose drugs he takes. And <<since**T4**Spelling**None**5**snice>> it's not his or her competence how can he be responsible for it?
The other main issue in the problem of illegal drugs is, of course, ethics. Sport is a highly ethical activity with an entire set of regulating rules existing in order to "keep the game clean". Public opinion on sport also plays a role here: people believe that while sport is all about health and honesty there is no place for drugs and cheating at all. It gives a good ground for the proponents of permanent ban of sportsmen for illegal drugs. Though it can be harsh, this argument has a strong ethical base.
In my view, ban of a sportsman for a limited period of time for the use of illegal drugs in sports is the best option. People in sport nowadays will take drugs anyway just due to the industry requirements. It's also on industry to decide whether a new drug is illegal or not. So the striking question here is how can we blame a man for what he is given while he doesn't make a choice on it?
