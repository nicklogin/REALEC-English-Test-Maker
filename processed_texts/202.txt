However, in other countries there <<were**T11**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> some of them.

Latin America <<had**T18**Tense_choice**None**3**has>> the same <<tendency**T19**lex_item_choice**None**10**tendention>>. Its unemployment rate <<fell**T20**Tense_choice**None**10**has fallen>> too, but just by 1%.

Overall, in some countries this rate <<was**T26**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> stable, in others – growing or falling. <<The most important question**T266**Absence_comp_sent**None**18**The most important>> is what <<caused**T28**Tense_choice**None**10**has caused>> these changes.
