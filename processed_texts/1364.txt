Nowadays it is often discussed that using modern technology a lot causes <<the increase**T2**Articles**None**11**an increase>> of various health problems, but there are some ways to reduce <<them**T3**Ref_device**None**2**it>>.

It is a well known fact that in <<today's**T4**Spelling**None**6**todays>> world people use gadgets a lot. Computers and cell phones became necessary things for almost all of us, so that we use them more often than any other things and this is very harmful for our eyes. Sitting in front of the computer during work day and then spending time looking at phone screens makes our eyes very stressed. Moreover, it causes <<a pain**T5**Articles**None**4**pain>> in <<the back**T6**Articles**None**4**back>>. Moreover, <<nowadays**T7**lex_item_choice**None**5**today>> most people use cars and walk on foot <<not so often**T8**lex_item_choice**None**11**very little>><< which**T9**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> also leads to physical weakness and sometimes even to obesity.

However, <<there are**T10**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**there>> always some ways to reduce the harmful <<influence**T11**lex_item_choice**None**6**impact>> of technologies. For instance, it is obvious that <<those**T12**Ref_device**None**4**ones>> who spend a lot of time working on <<a computer**T13**Articles**None**8**computer>> should <<not to forget**T14**lex_item_choice**None**8**remember>> to <<have**T15**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> a rest regularly, #DELETE#2#as even 5-10 minutes of eye-exercises <<can help**T17**Modals**None**5**helps>> to avoid eye stress<< which**T18**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> can <<lead to**T19**lex_item_choice**None**9**result in>> <<a short-sight**T20**Articles**None**11**short-sight>>. <<Furthermore**T21**Spelling**None**10**Furthemore>>, it is always better to <<go by**T22**Prepositions**None**5**go on>> foot. Spending spare time by walking in the park is also much more healthier than chatting in socias <<medias**T23**lex_item_choice**None**4**nets>>. In addition, we need to do some sport in order to keep in shape and avoid such problem as obesity. Besides, only physical activity <<can help us**T26**Absence_explanation**None**5**helps>> to have a better mood and feel full of evergy.

Taking everything into account, I would like to point out that even though the unreasonable and not <<wise**T26**Spelling**None**4**wize>> use of modern technologies can cause health problems, to avoid them and stay healthy
