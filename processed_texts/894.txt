Today more and more professional athletes take drugs to show better results <<in**T29**Prepositions**None**2**on>> their competitions. Some people believe that there is no need for a very strict punishment for it: the sportsmen should not be allowed to compete for 2 years. Others <<suppose**T1**Tense_form**None**11**are suppose>> that punishment for such cheating should be less mild: such athletes might not compete for the rest of their lives. So, the first opinion <<implies**T8**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> that <<such an unfair method**T9**Articles**None**18**such unfair method>> of winning the games is not something criminal. They <<suppose**T2**Tense**None**11**are suppose>> that everyone has <<his or her**T10**Ref_device**None**3**its>> own right <<to make a mistake**T11**Absence_comp_colloc**None**11**for mistake>>. For example, somebody can be too young to understand <<he or she**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> is <<going**T13**lex_item_choice**None**5**doing>> a wrong way using the illegal drugs, but after a ban for 2 years <<he**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> will understand that <<one**T15**Ref_device**None**2**he>> should not do such things. The second opinion is that <<cheating**T7**Gerund_phrase**None**12**the cheating>> in professional sports is cruel and it should be punished very <<severely**T32**lex_item_choice**None**6**strong>>. If one <<has**T3**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> cheated, <<he**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> should not have a chance to take part in professional sport anymore. <<Moreover,**T32**Punctuation**None**12**Nevertheless>> it is not very democratic, it will be a good way to preserve unfair competition. As for me, I totally agree with the first opinion. <<However,**T5**Punctuation**None**7**However>> the use of illegal drugs in athletics is awful, it is just a mistake that can be forgotten if the athlete <<does not break**T30**Agreement_errors**None**15**does not breaks>> the law anymore. We all do <<wrong things**T20**Articles**None**16**the wrong things>> in our lives<<, and athletes are not an exception**T22**Confusion_of_structures**None**16**; so do athletes>>. <<The matter is,**T23**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**The matter>> if one <<admits**T25**lex_item_choice**None**7**accepts>> <<one's**T24**Ref_device**None**4**ones>> mistakes <<he or she**T31**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**and>> then <<does**T26**Tense_choice**None**5**doing>> <<the right thing**T27**Absence_explanation**None**5**right>>. To conclude, the athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned for sure, but they need <<a chance**T6**Articles**None**10**the chance>> to <<improve their reputaton**T28**lex_item_choice**None**25**make their reputaton good>> again after the punishment <<period.**T32**Punctuation**None**6**period>>
