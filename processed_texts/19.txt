It is argued that free sharing and <<copying**T1**lex_item_choice**None**4**copy>> #DELETE#2#of music and films <<on**T3**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet does a lot of harm to <<people**T4**Articles**None**10**the people>> who produce this content and those who enjoy it <<, and**T5**Punctuation**None**3**and>> those who do not want to <<pay for it**T17**Absence_explanation**None**3**pay>> must be considered #DELETE#2#as criminals. <<Personally,**T7**Punctuation**None**10**Personally>> I disagree with that claim and I hold <<an opinion**T8**Articles**None**11**the opinion>> that punishment is not an effective solution to the named problem.
<<Undoubtedly**T9**Spelling**None**10**Undoubtely>>, there are some reasons for punishing people who do not pay for the content. To begin with, musicians and producers lose money they <<deserve**T10**Tense_choice**None**8**deserved>> and it leads to <<the lack of motivation**T11**Articles**None**18**lack of motivation>> to create new films and music tracks. Additionally, money payed <<by**T16**Prepositions**None**3**for>> art producers are investments in future projects. Finally, losing such amounts of money hurts not only creators, but also the government budget which has its own profit from the taxes.
Nevertheless, punishing for copying and sharing music and videos seems to be <<a bad idea**T12**Articles**None**8**bad idea>>. Firstly, free products of art <<provide**T13**Agreement_errors**None**8**provides>> cultural development of <<population**T18**Articles**None**14**the population>>. It is irrational and even unfair to punish those who are aimed at self-development <<, but**T19**Punctuation**None**3**but>> do not have money for it. <<These people**T20**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**11**This person>> can be <<children**T21**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**7**a child>>, <<students**T22**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**9**a student>> or just <<people**T23**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**8**somebody>> with financial problems. Secondly, people who are able to pay will pay if they <<adored**T24**Tense_choice**None**5**adore>> the content and they want to <<give thanks**T25**lex_item_choice**None**15**say some thanks>> to those who created it. Thirdly, the Internet is <<an informational field**T27**Articles**None**23**the informational field>> <<, which**T28**Punctuation**None**5**which>> is difficult to control by the law, so punishing will be technically difficult to implement.
To sum up, punishing for sharing and copying objects of art can satisfy those who produce them, but <<can also influence**T29**Standard**None**18**also can influence>> on cultural development in <<a negative way**T14**Articles**None**12**negative way>>.
