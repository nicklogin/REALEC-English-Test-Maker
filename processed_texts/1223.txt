A lot of people like to eat vey different food from other countries, but there are some of them who think<< that**T1**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> their own countries should produce food for their own population and import not so much of it. 

As for me, I <<cannot**T2**Inappropriate_register**None**5**canâ€™t>> agree with this statement. I think, that all countries should produce <<food**T3**Articles**None**8**the food>> as for their population <<and**T4**Spelling**None**2**ad>> for import <<to**T5**Prepositions**None**2**in>> different countries as much as possible. Firstly, not every country stands in <<a good economical situation**T6**Articles**None**25**good economical situation>>, so, they should increase <<the import of**T28**Prepositions**None**6**import>> food or something else abroad, and sell it for <<for the prices that are bigger**T10**Word_order**None**12**bigger price>> <<than**T11**Often_confused**None**4**then>> in their own countries. Secondly, there are some countries<< which**T12**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> produce not so many <<kinds**T13**Noun_number**None**4**kind>> of food or <<do**T14**Agreement_errors**None**4**does>> not produce it. So, how such <<countries**T15**Articles**None**11**a countries>> can <<stay**T16**lex_item_choice**None**5**stand>> not in crysis, that is why more developed countries must share their food product with others. It <<can help**T17**Modals**None**9**will help>> both countries: <<those that import**T18**Absence_explanation**None**12**which import>> will earn money, while <<others**T19**lex_item_choice**None**7**another>> can buy food and <<feed**T20**lex_item_choice**None**7**decided>> their own people,. 

Thirdly, it is really comfortable, because you can eat what you want, you just need to go to the supermarket and buy, <<for example,**T21**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> strawberries in winter, which were imported from Thailand or somewhere else. In addition, it is right to help less developed countries, because your country can <<export**T22**lex_item_choice**None**11**import them>> food, when they can produce and import something useful for <<their**T23**Ref_device**None**4**your>> country.

In conclusion, I would like to say<< that**T24**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> every human has their own opinion, but governments have to make <<the right decisions**T25**Articles**None**15**right decisions>><< which**T26**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> will help their countries to make <<the economical situation more stable**T27**Standard**None**29**a stable economical situation>>. That is why many countries should import food as much as <<possible.**T28**Punctuation**None**8**possible>>
