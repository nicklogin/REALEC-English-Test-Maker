Many of us <<say**T1**Agreement_errors**None**4**says>><< that**T2**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<our**T3**Ref_device**None**5**their>> country should <<produce food**T4**Absence_explanation**None**7**produce>> <<only**T5**lex_item_choice**None**3**all>> for <<every**T7**lex_item_choice**None**4**each>> <<man**T6**Noun_number**None**3**men>> or women<< who lives on this territory**T8**Defining**None**28**, who live on this territory>>. These people believe<< that**T9**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<government should use food import**T10**Standard**None**33**food import government should use>> as little as possible. <<An ideal country**T11**Articles**None**13**Ideal country>> for these people <<is**T12**Agreement_errors**None**6**it are>> may cities and manufactories<< with**T13**Punctuation**None**6**, with>> <<developed**T15**Category_confusion**None**10**developing>> #DELETE#4#each <<products**T16**Noun_number**None**7**product>> of our everyday ration for breakfast and dinner. In this essay <<I talk**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**talk>> about both sides of this topic.

Of course, <<the situation**T19**Articles**None**9**situation>> when people eat products that <<have been produced**T20**Voice**None**8**produced>> on own plantations is good for the <<prices**T22**lex_item_choice**None**5**costs>> of <<these**T21**Ref_device**None**4**this>> items. People do not pay more, because in this situation <<prices**T23**lex_item_choice**None**5**costa>> <<do not include**T24**Tense_form**None**11**not include>> #DELETE#7#pay for delivery and many other taxs. Moreover, <<the life**T56**Spelling**None**4**live>> without import products helps people in these countries <<to be**T27**Infinitive_constr**None**2**be>> <<sure**T28**Articles**None**6**a sure>> in <<the next day**T29**Articles**None**8**next day>>. Of course, these factors <<show**T30**lex_item_choice**None**4**says>><< that**T31**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<this model is**T32**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**this model>> good for all countries in the world.

However, many countries do not have some resources on their territory. For example, many countries do not have oil or gas. But many of these countries have rice, salt, sugar, vegetables or other products. It is the basis of international economic. If countries <<did not exchange**T33**Conditionals**None**17**will not exchange>> resources, then <<lives**T35**Noun_number**None**4**life>> <<of each of us**T37**Prepositions**None**10**each of us>> <<would be**T38**Conditionals**None**7**will be>> bad and <<depressed**T39**lex_item_choice**None**5**worry>>. Because <<the process**T40**Articles**None**7**process>> of <<changing**T41**Category_confusion**None**6**change>> <<the resources**T42**Articles**None**9**resources>> is one of the most <<importanr process**T43**Absence_explanation**None**9**important>> for <<every**T44**lex_item_choice**None**4**each>> government. 

I think<< that**T45**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> our everyday life now is better <<than**T46**Often_confused**None**4**then>> life in <<countries**T47**Noun_number**None**7**country>> without <<a good economic structure**T48**Articles**None**23**good economic structure>>. Of course, it is good<< when**T49**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> all of your ration <<grows**T50**Tense_choice**None**7**growing>> on your garden, but my opinion <<is that**T51**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**is>> in modern world it is not possible. I think<< that**T52**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<every**T53**lex_item_choice**None**4**each>> country should use <<both**T54**lex_item_choice**None**2**as>> own products <<and**T55**Spelling**None**2**as>> <<imported**T56**Category_confusion**None**6**import>> resources.
