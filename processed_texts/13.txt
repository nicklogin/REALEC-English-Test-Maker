There is <<a point of view**T1**Articles**None**13**point of view>>, that musicians and film producers suffer from pirate <<copying**T3**Spelling**None**7**copping>> of <<their songs and films**T4**Absence_explanation**None**15**songs and films>>, so they lose a lot of money. For some people downloading music and films is a theft<< that**T69**Often_confused**None**7**, which>> must be punished. 
<<On the one hand,**T7**Punctuation**None**15**On the one hand>> it is a <<real**T8**Category_confusion**None**6**really>> problem, because people always download music and films <<for free**T9**Prepositions**None**4**free>> for a long time. The film or composition <<could be done**T10**lex_item_choice**None**8**was done>> in 1990 #DELETE#4#year, for example, but people are <<listening to it**T12**Prepositional_verb**None**12**listening it>> <<for free**T13**Prepositions**None**4**free>> for latest years. Musicians and producers <<spend**T14**lex_item_choice**None**7**involve>> a lot of money <<on**T15**Prepositions**None**3**for>> their compositions, so they need to make money again by selling films or music disks in special shops. The main <<part**T17**lex_item_choice**None**4**role>> <<play**T16**Agreement_errors**None**5**plays>> <<authors' rights**T18**lex_item_choice**None**10**own rights>> and <<property rights**T19**Standard**None**18**rights of property>>. <<A musician**T20**Articles**None**8**Musician>> or <<a producer**T21**Articles**None**8**producer>> makes <<images,**T23**Punctuation**None**7**images.>> <<an interesting film**T24**Articles**None**21**some interesting film>> or beautiful music, so it is <<his**T26**Absence_explanation**None**3**his>> <<creation**T25**lex_item_choice**None**4**mind>> and <<he**T27**Absence_explanation**None**2**he>> <<must be given money for it**T28**Absence_explanation**None**19**must be given money>>. And people who take it from <<an author**T29**Articles**None**6**author>> without permission really make <<a theft**T30**Articles**None**5**theft>>.
<<On the other hand,**T31**Punctuation**None**17**On the other hand>> musicians and producers make money from concerts and <<films' screenings**T32**lex_item_choice**None**12**seeing films>> in the cinema, so they have enough money for <<a pleasant and comfortable surviving**T33**Articles**None**34**pleasant and comfortable surviving>>. <<Music**T36**Articles**None**9**The music>> and films were free <<on**T35**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the internet for a long time, so now people really cannot imagine life without it. <<Watching**T45**lex_item_choice**None**6**Seeing>> films and <<listening to music**T37**Prepositional_verb**None**15**listening music>> is a good chance to improve your <<skills**T38**Spelling**None**6**shills>> or <<knowledge**T39**lex_item_choice**None**4**mind>>. <<For example,**T40**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> some <<Russian**T41**Capitalisation**None**7**russian>> people like to <<watch**T44**lex_item_choice**None**3**see>> original <<English**T42**Capitalisation**None**7**english>> or <<French**T43**Capitalisation**None**6**french>> films because of studying languages. Another argument is that buying all new films or <<music disks**T46**Noun_number**None**10**music disk>> is too expensive. There are a lot of new films and some people have <<no**T47**Category_confusion**None**3**not>> money to buy <<it -**T48**Punctuation**None**3**it.>> <<for example,**T69**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> poor people or children, who <<don't have**T51**lex_item_choice**None**11**are without>> parents and have no money to do it. But they may download some films or music or watch it <<online**T52**Spelling**None**7**on-line>> <<on**T53**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the internet.  <<From this point of view,**T54**Linking_device**None**13**For this mind>> <<uploading free copies of films**T55**Absence_explanation**None**10**free films>> <<is**T56**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> not a theft, because it helps to develop people’s <<knowledge**T57**lex_item_choice**None**4**mind>>.
It is likely to think #DELETE#10#for people that <<using free music and films**T59**Absence_explanation**None**20**free music and films>> <<on**T60**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the internet is a better way than <<buying**T61**Category_confusion**None**3**buy>> it. <<According to this opinion,**T69**Punctuation**None**16**For this opinion>> <<downloading illegal copies of films or music**T64**Transitive**None**47**downloading of illegal copies of films or music>> should not be punished because of <<it's**T67**Noun_attribute**None**2**it>> help and pleasant <<influence on**T68**Prepositional_noun**None**13**influence for>> people’s <<lives**T69**Spelling**None**5**lifes>>.
