It has been discussed for centuries whether criminals have to stay in prisons as long as possible in order to hamper their illegal actions or there are other ways to achieve this goal in every state. This essay argues that jail is not a decision of this problem; however, both <<views**T24**Spelling**None**6**viewes>> are considered.

First of all, the main way to prevent some society members from criminal deeds is education, because it affects a person's consciousness at first. To put it more precisely, if a human is to<<taught**T8**Derivation**None**6**tought>>hat crimes, murders and other types of illegal actions entail only pu<<punishment,**T12**Punctuation**None**10**punishment>>hey can one day be persuaded by th<<these**T13**Determiners**None**4**this>>ropositions. For instance, today many prisoners who have comitted crimes are to<<taught**T14**Derivation**None**6**tought>>y professional psychologists and the majority of them really changes their li<<lifestyle**T15**Compound_word**None**10**life style>>Secondly, the punishment of<<for**T16**Prepositions**None**2**of>>rimes could be toughened up in order to keep at bay some da<<individuals who are dangerous for society's safety**T17**Standard**None**42**dangerous for society's safety individuals>>For intstance, in the USA no<<not**T21**Spelling**None**2**no>>he long-term isolation (because a <<in this case a person**T20**Standard**None**21**a person in this case>>ealizes that he or she will inevitably leave a <<jail**T11**Articles**None**6**a jail>>n the future) but the highest form of punishment - ki<<death sentence**T19**lex_item_choice**None**4**kill>> mo<<motivates**T18**Tense_form**None**8**motivate>>eople not to commit such deeds. It could be also added that the purpose of reduction crimes should affect not only ed<<education**T22**Category_confusion**None**11**educational>>nd law systems but also all social sp<<spheres**T9**Spelling**None**7**spehres>>here inadequate or craving for money people are under control and observation. One convincing example is special places where criminals can realize their in<<intentions**T23**Derivation**None**10**intensions>>ot in a harmful way; for example, they can, being under control of doctors and policemen, take care about seniors or children.
On the other hand, prison in <<is**T1**Spelling**None**2**in>>e best teacher to convince a criminal of his or her mistakes. As it is widely known, a person who is prisoned fac<<faces**T3**Tense_form**None**4**face>>lot of obstacles such as pressure of other criminals, abuse, deficiency of food which could be taken by more popular and strong pri<<convicts**T10**lex_item_choice**None**13**prisoned ones>>o set an example, many cri<<criminals**T4**Spelling**None**10**criminalas>>ending at least a quarter of life in jail and suffering an infinite number of problems try to live a completely different life when they are free. Moreover, the fear of a long isolation from loved ones or family members and a singnificant lack of communication, what to a certain ext<<extent**T5**Spelling**None**6**extant>>fects persons' mind, can persuade criminals to abandon the type of satisfying their financial or other needs.

To sum up, moder<<modern**T6**Spelling**None**5**moder>>ety is highly concerned about criminals' destiny and the problem of crimes reduction and mane <<many**T7**Spelling**None**4**mane>>ures are taken in this field. But I strongly believe that prison cannot provide society members' safety without additional attempts to improve this situation in many life spheres.
