Nowadays a lot of music files and films are downloaded on the <<Internet**T1**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. Because of it many musicians and film producers lose huge <<amount**T2**Often_confused**None**6**number>> of money. Some people believe that man who <<downloads**T3**Agreement_errors**None**8**download>> these files is a <<thief**T4**Spelling**None**4**thif>> and should be punished. But others claim that it is normal nowadays.
I agree that downloading films and music on the <<Internet**T5**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> instead of <<buying**T6**Spelling**None**5**buing>> it is <<illegal**T7**Spelling**None**7**illigal>>. Producers and musicians invest a lot of money and <<effort**T8**lex_item_choice**None**5**force>> <<in**T9**Prepositions**None**3**for>> it. It is their job <<, and**T10**Punctuation**None**3**and>> it is unnormal that they cannot get money from sales <<of their disks**T11**Prepositions**None**11**their disks>>. Moreover, <<stealing**T12**Spelling**None**8**stolling>> on the <<Internet**T13**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> can <<lead**T14**lex_item_choice**None**7**conduct>> to <<stealing**T15**Spelling**None**8**stolling>> in real life. Children can think that it is usual to get something without paying. Maybe punishing can change this <<wrong**T16**lex_item_choice**None**6**filthy>> situation. <<Why do some people get money for their labour and others do not?**T17**Abs_comp_clause**None**58**Why some people get money for their labour and others not?>>
On the other hand, sometimes prices for films, music and other files <<are**T18**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> really huge. <<If i want to watch a film,**T20**Punctuation**None**25**If I want to watch a film>> I must have money. But <<if i do not have it,**T22**Punctuation**None**19**if I do not have it>> I can lose a lot of information (in situation with films) and <<it can influence me and my relations with other people badly**T23**Standard**None**60**it can badly influence me and my relations with other people>>. Moreover, it is possible that people do it because they do not know for what exactly they pay. I mean, it is quite strange to pay money for film which will be closen after ten minutes.
In addition, I believe that, on the one hand, coping and sharing music and films on the <<Internet**T25**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> should be punished (but not hard) because of <<efforts**T26**lex_item_choice**None**6**forces>> and souls which were expended on creating films and music. But <<, one the other hand,**T27**Punctuation**None**18**on the other hand,>> punishing <<can have**T28**Verb_Bare_Inf**None**7**can has>> <<a bad influence**T29**Articles**None**13**bad influence>> on fans and their love to art.
To sum up, it is not easy to choose one side. But I agree with people <<who are against**T30**Abs_comp_clause**None**11**who against>> the punishing because it has more disadvantages than advantages.
