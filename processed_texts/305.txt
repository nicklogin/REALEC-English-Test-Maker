Illegal pirate copies <<are**T1**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> a large problem of our life. Most of people don’t want to pay for pleasures. The <<government**T2**Spelling**None**9**goverment>> and different producers try to solve this problem situation, but it is not too easy, because of big numbers of copies and <<a large number**T3**Articles**None**12**large number>> of people<< who use it**T4**Defining**None**12**, who use it>>.
I agree with the statement<< that**T5**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> copying and sharing, music or films on the <<Internet**T7**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> is <<a theft**T8**Articles**None**5**theft>>. First of all, to make <<films**T9**Spelling**None**5**firms>> or songs is a profession, and all work should be paid. Everyone get money from job, and producers also should get it. Although, it is not honest<< when**T10**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> someone buy original discs or songs, for example, on app <<store**T11**Spelling**None**4**stor>>, when other people get it for free. Everyone should pay, not only a few per cent of users. Moreover, it is not right<< when**T12**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> someone<< who sells pirate copies**T13**Defining**None**25**, who sells pirate copies>> get money from it.
However, I don’t agree with the statement<< that**T14**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> people<< who download these files**T15**Defining**None**26**, who download these files>> should be punished. In my opinion, <<government**T16**Spelling**None**9**goverment>> should punish sellers, not users. Although, I believe<< that**T17**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> it is necessary to give people <<an opportunity**T18**Articles**None**11**opportunity>> to buy music and films <<easily**T19**Category_confusion**None**4**easy>> and <<cheaply**T20**Category_confusion**None**5**cheap>>.
In the conclusion, I can say<< that**T21**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> I’m sure<< that**T22**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<government**T23**Spelling**None**9**goverment>> should explain people<< that**T24**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they have to pay for pleasure. When everyone <<understands**T25**Agreement_errors**None**10**understand>> it – <<there**T26**Spelling**None**4**ther>> won’t be a problem.
