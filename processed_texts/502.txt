<<Nowadays**T1**Punctuation**None**9**Nowadays,>> a lot of scientists work on <<space exploration problems**T5**Noun_number**None**29**the space exploration problem>>. Governments of many countries spend enormous amount of money on relevant researches, whereas a lot of other problems, such as poverty, hunger or environmental issues are still not solved. So, it is not surprising that many people think that spending money on space exploration is pointless and it would be better to work on solving more urgent problems in society.

I believe that it is a <<quite a fair**T6**Standard**None**12**a quite fair>>pinion. Firstly, it is not smart to spend a huge part of country's budget on space exploration when the economic situation in your country is not very stable. For example, in the last three years Russia di<<carried out**T7**lex_item_choice**None**3**did>> few unsuccessful experiments with cargo spacecrafts (one of them was "Progress"). These failures cost mi<<billions**T8**Numerals**None**9**milliards>>nd it is hard not to get angry when you think about possibility of spending th<<this money**T9**Countable_uncountable**None**11**these money>>n improving medicine or education in Russia. Secondly, the fast progress in this field of researches is not possible without common technical progress, so, spending a huge amount of money on in<<it**T10**Spelling**None**2**in>>ust makes no big sense for countries, << which**T11**Punctuation**None**7**, which>>a<<do not have**T12**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**have not>>o#DELETE#2# impressive background an<<nor**T14**lex_item_choice**None**7**and not>>ell-developed technical industry. It is sad, but I am talking about Russia again: in my opinion, the country, << which imports most of the technical products**T3**Defining**None**47**, which imports most of the technical products,>>ust is no<<unable**T15**Prefix**None**8**not able>>o be tr<<a truly successful space power**T16**Articles**None**28**truly successful space power>>
However, it is hard to say that we do not need space exploration at all. It is well known that natural resources are not endl<<infinite**T17**lex_item_choice**None**7**endless>> one of the possible deci<<solutions to**T18**lex_item_choice**None**12**decisions of>>s problem is colonization of other planets. So, it is smart to start thinking about it right now. But, in my opinion, only the countries with stable economic situation can allow and have to allo#DELETE#19#w themselves to spend big money on such researches and experiments: for example, I think that at this moment Elon Musk is one of the most important people for the humanity because of his space projects.

All in all, humanity obviously needs space exploration, but it is important to set priorities wisely and not think about space too much when your country has anothe<<other**T2**Often_confused**None**7**another>>t problems.
