Despite always having an interest in the outer space, people have received an opportunity to explore it just recently. Space exploration requires plenty of money and some people think that <<this**T1**Pronouns**None**4**that>> is the reasonable price to pay, while others disagree and claim that there are problems on the Earth that need money, too.
To my mind, space exporation costs us way too much. Before exploring the outer space, we should deal with the issues on our planet firstly. For instance, the problem of w<<the world hunger**T2**Articles**None**12**world hunger>>remains unsolved to this day and money should be spent on the people who starve,<< because lives of millions of people are valuable**T3**Punctuation**None**50**, because lives of millions of people are valuable>> More than that, there are also many issues related to the state of the planet itself. Even if we could conquer another planet, we would not be able to live there. This is why we should be more focused o<<on**T4**Prepositions**None**2**of>>resolving enviromental problems. The Earth is our home and we should take care of it.
However, other people claim that space exploration is very important and it is definitely useful for humanity. Firstly, they say that in#DELETE#8# space th<<in outer space there can be found many different materials that can be used by people**T6**Standard**None**85**there can be found many different materials in outer space that can be used by people>>Secondly, some of them suppose that there is life in outer space and space exploration could help us encounter aliens, which could be very exciting.
To sum up, there are different points of view on this issue but I would say that disadvantages of spending money on space exploration outweigh its advatages. There are many problems to resolve that are more urgent right now.
