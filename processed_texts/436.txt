The growing crime rates are the topic of ubiquitous concern nowadays, and the situation is only aggravated by the fact that more and more young individuals are being engaged in this malicious process. But what are the reasons of this tendency and what, more importantly, can be done, to prevent it from future exacerbation? These are the questions to discuss.

Firstly, the increasing level of juvenile deliquency can be explained by the amount of freedom, granted to people in general. Less severe gun control policies and the abolition of capital punishment in many states question the authority of the government for the common people. And young people are more perceptive to this rebellious spirit.
Secondly, the proportion of the youngsters does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the crime. So the increase in question may show not the rise in murders, but in rather less serious mischiefs, like, for instance, smoking in public places. And the growing proportion of the young people here can be explained by the absence of true crime in the eyes of young criminals, which, so to say, legalize such actions.

What about the measures to be taken, these are mostly the duty of parents and teachers. They ought to show their own respect to law by their own example and teach the importance of other people's life and property, as no one can guarantee one's own safety.

All in all, we should not jump the gun and blame violent films and videogames for the growing juvenile deliquency, as it is mainly the guilt of the system and people's nature, that nudges the youngsters towards mischief. But solutions do exist and measures can be taken to slow down this downward movement.
