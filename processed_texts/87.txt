Nowadays, when <<everyone**T1**Spelling**None**9**every one>> has the Internet connection, it’s easy to download any music or films that you want and don’t pay anything. Such people are <<pirates**T2**Spelling**None**6**pirats>> <<, and**T3**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<I fully agree**T4**Tense_form**None**15**I’m fully agree>> with the point of view that <<pirates**T5**Articles**None**10**the pirats>> should be punished.
First of all, <<musicians**T7**Articles**None**13**the musicians>> and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year from illegal pirate copies. That’s why the quality of music and films is decreasing. Because <<artists**T8**Articles**None**11**the artists>> don’t get #DELETE#3#one full amount of money, they <<won't be able to use**T10**Tense_choice**None**12**couldn’t use>> it to make better music or films, they <<won't have**T11**Tense_choice**None**10**don’t have>> any <<guarantee**T12**lex_item_choice**None**9**evidences>> that their next work wouldn’t be downloaded from the Internet for free.
Secondly, it’s <<obvious**T13**Category_confusion**None**9**obviously>><< that**T14**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> every work should be paid off. For example, we pay for <<food**T16**Articles**None**8**the food>> in the supermarket or for <<any other material thing**T15**Articles**None**28**the any other material thing>>. But it’s hard to pay for something that you can’t feel in your hand. But, as for me, <<here**T17**lex_item_choice**None**5**there>> <<applies**T18**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> the same logic <<, and**T19**Punctuation**None**3**and>> people don’t download <<a film**T20**Articles**None**8**the film>>, for example, they steal it, like they can steal a fruit in the supermarket.
Thirdly, when we buy an illegal copy of <<a product**T21**Articles**None**11**the product>>, we don’t get <<full emotions**T22**Articles**None**17**the full emotions>>, because #DELETE#2#of such copies have <<a bad quality**T24**Articles**None**15**the bad quality>>, not so beautiful print, for example, and many other things. Moreover, I think<< that**T25**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> buying one pirate copy of <<a music disk**T52**Absence_explanation**None**9**the music>> or film we don’t make a special connection between the artist and the consumer.
And last, but not <<the least**T29**Articles**None**5**least>>, #DELETE#7#is that <<illegal pirate copies**T31**Articles**None**25**the illegal pirate copies>> aren’t good for <<economics**T32**lex_item_choice**None**11**the economy>> of <<countries**T33**Articles**None**13**the countries>>. Buying <<a legal copy**T35**Articles**None**14**the legal copy>>, you pay a special fee, which can be used, for example, <<for developing social systems**T36**Absence_explanation**None**18**for social systems>> of the country. Stealing <<music**T38**Articles**None**9**the music>> you <<do**T39**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> bad things <<not only for the artists, but also for the other citizens**T40**Absence_explanation**None**43**for the artists, but for the other citizens>> of the country #DELETE#3#too. 
All in all, <<pirates**T42**Articles**None**10**the pirats>> should be punished, because they are stealing <<products**T46**Noun_number**None**11**the product>> like <<goods**T44**lex_item_choice**None**10**some thing>> in <<a shop**T45**Articles**None**8**the shop>>. They are just <<typical**T47**Spelling**None**7**tipical>> <<thieves**T48**Noun_number**None**5**thief>> #DELETE#3#who who are <<destroying**T53**Spelling**None**9**destroing>> the <<economics**T50**lex_item_choice**None**7**economy>> of the country and don’t get <<a full spectrum of emotions**T51**Articles**None**29**the full spectrum of emotions>> from <<amazing works**T52**Articles**None**17**the amazing works>> of musicians and film producers.
