Many people think that distributing of pirate copies in the Internet should be stopped. I absolutely agree with this statement.

First of all, every writer, singer, actor and other content maker tries to create a unique product. And the official release of this product is pivotal pare of the process for the author. I am convinced that every work should has its award. But people who share illegal copies do not understand this. Consequently, musicians and film producers suffer huge losses from this illegal actions.

Secondly, I think that distribution of pirate copies can hurm the author. For example, fans of Twilight saga hacked computer of the author, Stephanie Mayer and and shared in the Internet her book. But the book was not been finished. And Stephanie decided to stop working with it. Fans made pleas and asked her to finish but she was really sad.

There are people who say that the Internet is an open space and nowadays we do not need to pay, for music and films. But they should know that there are many websites where users can find and download content for money. It means that internet pirates share for money music and films that they did not produce. I think it is illegal actions and for this theft they can be arrested.

All things considered, I want to say that sharing of illegal pirate copies in the Internet must be stopped. People must pay for music and films, because it is the result of someone's work that should have a money award.
