There is an opinion in society that it should be a punishment for people who consume illegal pirate copies and helps thieves make more money. I disagree with this statement for a series of reasons.

Firstly, nowadays people can make a decision pay for an entertainment content or not. These circumstances provide an opportunity not give a lot of money for something you maybe will not like at all.

Secondly, expose to lack of laws copying and sharing music on the Internet continues to grow, It is not costumer’s fault that special governement organizations can not protect the online information. It is evident that people who downloads pirate content are just users, they do not make a crime like producers of illegal copies.

However, there is an opposite point of view. Some people argue that if people will know about certain consequances of their doings like punishment, they will stop downloading illegal information. It probably a good idea for future experience but it requires a huge government spendings and new technologies to know who hacks the sources or break the law.

So, the only way to stop the crimes with author’s rights is to create a better system to regulate producing pirate copies.

In conclusion, money should not be such important for musicians and film producers because their masterpieces were made to bring beauty to the world, it should be more precious for an artist than making money.

So punishment for Internet users will not lead to decreasing of pirate content and increasing in artists savings.
