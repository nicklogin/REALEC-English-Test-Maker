Nowadays crime statistics shows sad results. The number of the crimes committed by youngsters reached the highest peak. Some people claim that it is a fault of modern parents. But I can argue that the causes are tied with education system.
Modern parents are mostly millenials. They spend a lot of time on job. High necessity to build the career makes people spend less time on their families. As a result, parents often entertain their kids with the help of TV, games and internet sources, which don't provide good content with adequate and useful information. Therefore, advocates of this opinion claim that this trend created the whole generation with ubnormal values and unadequate perception of the world, what is straight reason of crimes.
From my point of view, first of all crimes show that child has problems with socializing and understanding of social norms. It is meaningful function of school to teach students the fundamentals of normal behavior in society. Nowadays education system is more interested in high scores and ability of students to solve difficult tasks. But math is not the most important thing in the world. So school should provide more attention to personalities of it's students and teach them how to communicate with others; how to be responsible for your actions. School also should teach to respect other people and be tolerate.
In conclusion I want to highlight that education should be more proper. Because school is not only responsible for knowledge, but also over lives.
