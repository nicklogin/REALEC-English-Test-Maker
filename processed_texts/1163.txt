The <<governments**T2**Noun_number**None**10**government>> #DELETE#16#of the countries concider that they only need to produce the products which their population eats, and should aim to import less. And I want to discuss #DELETE#5#about it in <<this**T4**Ref_device**None**4**that>> essay.

I believe that <<it is**T5**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> really important to use products which <<are made**T6**Voice**None**4**make>> in your country. <<It is**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**4**It’s>> not just about food, but about some electronic, cars and <<something**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**4**smth>> else. For example, in the USSR <<there was**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**was>> <<an indeal situation**T10**Articles**None**19**the ideal situation>>. There <<was**T11**Agreement_errors**None**4**were>> not import, but people were happy and they <<did not feel**T12**Tense_choice**None**13**were not feel>> <<the deficit**T13**Articles**None**7**deficit>>. People of our country made all products and food by <<themselves**T14**Spelling**None**9**themselvs>>. And that is why the USSR was the greatest country in the world with ideal economic. But there were some technologies which the soviet <<workers**T15**Noun_number**None**6**worker>> <<did not**T16**lex_item_choice**None**6**wasn’t>> learn. That is why we import some food from <<other countries**T17**Articles**None**19**the other countries>>. 

But in Russia the situation is <<different**T18**lex_item_choice**None**4**else>>. We import almost every product. Our fields <<are**T19**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> empty. Our country <<takes the biggest place**T20**lex_item_choice**None**20**has the biggest size>>, but we <<do not**T21**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> use it. Because of that a lot of people, who work in the USSR on the fields, <<do not have**T22**Inappropriate_register**None**7**haven’t>> <<a job**T23**Articles**None**3**job>> now. But <<people**T24**lex_item_choice**None**10**population>> need food and the <<only**T25**lex_item_choice**None**6**lonely>> method to get food is <<to buy**T26**Infinitive_constr**None**3**buy>> it from other countries. <<Exactly,**T27**Punctuation**None**7**Exactly>> that is why a lot of people <<do not have**T28**Inappropriate_register**None**7**haven’t>> <<a job**T29**Articles**None**3**job>> and <<Russian**T30**Category_confusion**None**10**the Russia>> <<economic is**T31**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**economic>> on the bottom. But if the government <<will do**T32**Conditionals**None**2**do>> something to change it, do something to less impor, our economic will get the second <<chance**T33**lex_item_choice**None**4**life>>. 

<<To sum up,**T34**Punctuation**None**9**To sum up>> I want to say that <<it is**T35**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> very important to produce products that <<the population eats itself**T36**Confusion_of_structures**None**25**their own population eats>>. <<It can**T37**lex_item_choice**None**4**It’s>> save the economic of <<the country**T38**Articles**None**7**country>> and create <<work places**T39**Articles**None**15**the work places>> for people.
