It is a popular <<opinion**T290**Punctuation**None**8**opinion,>> that nowadays widespread use of modern technology has a bad impact on people's health. In this essay I will try to prove my agreement with this statement.

What is more, users of modern technology often suffer from <<insomnia**T296**lex_item_choice**None**9**sleepless>>. Besides, active using of different gadgets can cause proplems with eyes.
Nevertheless, there are some ways which can help to reduce or avoid these health problems.

It is <<noteworthy**T307**Punctuation**None**10**noteworth,>> that people can totally change their city life and go to the country. This action would radically prevent them from using of highly-technological gadgets.
To sum it all up, it should be said that it is a choice of everyone either to reduce the using of the results of modern technologies and try to save <<the health**T308**Articles**None**6**health>> or not.
