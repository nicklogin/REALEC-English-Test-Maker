There are many different arguments for and against illegal sharing files. As for me, of <<course**T1**Spelling**None**5**cause>>, it is not totally right, but I think people should not be strictly punished for copying without <<a licence**T30**Articles**None**7**lisence>>.
<<Firstly,**T32**Punctuation**None**7**Firstly>> not all people have enough money to efford a <<Blu-Ray**T4**Spelling**None**7**Bly-ray>> DVD, <<a subscription**T6**Articles**None**12**subscription>> to <<Netflix**T5**Spelling**None**7**Netflex>> but they still want to watch movies and listen to music they like. I think that musicians and <<TV-producers**T7**Spelling**None**11**TV-produers>> should give an option to the person to pay money or not, because this way they will be more generous to their fans. <<The famous Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky publishes his books in millions of copies, and he gives an opportunity to download it from the Internet for free.**T10**Punctuation**None**157**The famous Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky publishes his books in millions of copies , and he gives an opportunity to download it from the Internet for free>> In one of his <<interviews**T12**Noun_number**None**9**interview>> he said he wanted to <<let everyboby read**T13**Verb_object_bare**None**21**let everybody to read>> it <<, and**T14**Punctuation**None**3**and>> the appreciation of this work is worth much more than money. <<Actually,**T33**Punctuation**None**8**Actually>> people still would buy a paper book after reading<< electronic**T16**Punctuation**None**12**. electronic>><<an electronic version**T15**Articles**None**18**electronic version>> if they really liked it and enjoyed reading. <<The same thing is with music:**T30**Abs_comp_clause**None**25**The same thing with music>> <<if the song really touches your soul,**T19**Punctuation**None**36**if the song really touches your soul>> most people prefer to pay for a high-quality song. <<So there is no need to punish people who let us try some movies and music and then decide if we want it to buy.**T26**Punctuation**None**110**So there is no need to punish people who let us try some movies and music and then decide if we want it to buy>> 
Secondly, some educational movies should be avaliable <<for**T27**Prepositions**Dependent_change**2**to>> <<watching**T28**Gerund_phrase**Dependent_change**5**watch>> them for free, because forcing people to pay for basic knowledge of world leads to the uneducated nations and global problems – so at least Discovery and National Geographic programs should not take <<a fee**T29**Articles**None**3**fee>>.
<<It’s not a secret for everybody that companies lose lots of money because of illegal sharing of their files but I don’t think it’s a crucial question for them .**T31**Punctuation**None**158**It’s not a secret for everybody that companies lose lots of money because of illegal sharing of their files but I don’t think it’s a crucial question for them>> So copywriters should not be punished for their actions.
