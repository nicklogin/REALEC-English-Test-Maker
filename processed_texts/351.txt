Two bar charts given illustrate the <<percentage**T8**Often_confused**None**6**number>> of white and non-white people among ordinary people and prisoners in the UK and in the USA <<in 2015**T7**Redundant_comp**None**31**in the period of one year, 2015>>. It can be clearly seen from the chart that in the UK, the number of white people <<outweighs**T3**Tense_form**None**8**outweigh>> both in general population and in prison, <<in comparison to**T4**lex_part_choice**None**16**by comparison to>> the USA, where in general population the number of white people was significantly higher, than non-white. <<As for**T5**Linking_device**None**12**According to>> the prisoners in the USA, there were 33 percents of white people, which is 34 percents smaller than the number of non-white people. In the UK the vast majority of prisoners were white people as well as among general population. There were only 12 percents of non-white people in general population in the UK, whereas the number of non-white people in the USA was considerably higher, <<consisting 36 percent**T10**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**36 percent>>. Vast majority of those who were in gail in the USA was non-white people, by contrast to the UK, where there were only 26 percents of non-white prisoners.
Overall, it is obvious that the statistics in two countries was different.
