<<Nowadays**T1**Spelling**None**7**Nowaday>>, <<some people**T2**Absence_explanation**None**6**people>> have an opinion that some gadgets can be <<the problem**T3**Articles**None**9**a problem>> of <<increasing**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**growing>> health problems. 

First of all, <<one of the problems**T6**Word_order**None**23**the one of the problems>><< which new technology can cause**T5**Defining**None**32**, which new technology can cause>> is <<bad**T7**lex_item_choice**None**3**low>> eyesight. People always look <<in**T8**Prepositions**None**4**into>> their smartphones and computers because #DELETE#10#a constant modern lifestyle <<requires**T10**Voice**None**11**is required>> <<this**T11**Ref_device**None**4**that>> behaviour. Everyone has a lot of work<< which can be done only using computers**T12**Defining**None**40**, which can be done only using computers>>: some researches, projects. Most people usually start their day #DELETE#4#with checking <<news**T15**Articles**None**8**the news>> and social medias. This <<daily**T16**lex_item_choice**None**8**everyday>> routine <<turns into**T17**lex_item_choice**None**7**becomes>> a standard. The next problem is <<the absence of**T18**lex_item_choice**None**11**a less of a>> sport activities. It <<is caused**T20**Voice**None**6**caused>> by technologies <<, too**T19**Punctuation**None**3**too>>.  People  do not <<go**T21**lex_item_choice**None**3**get>> out #DELETE#10#of a house because they have <<everything they need**T23**lex_item_choice**None**10**all things>> for <<a proper life**T24**Articles**None**11**proper life>>.

For example, it is a fact, that a person<< who is walking at least thirty minutes a day**T40**Defining**None**50**, who is walking at least thirty minutes in a day,>> <<is**T41**Tense_choice**None**7**will be>> more productive <<at**T42**Prepositions**None**4**in a>> work. All #DELETE#2#of people <<depend on**T44**Prepositional_verb**None**9**depend in>> technology, so, the main solution <<for**T45**Prepositions**None**2**of>> <<health problems**T46**Articles**None**19**the health problems>> is to reduce the <<amount of time**T47**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**time>> #DELETE#2#of using gadgets. 

In conclusion, modern technology is an important part of peopleâ€™s life and <<they**T49**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**it>> <<help us**T59**Transitive**None**5**helps>> in many ways, tackle many problems and do <<our life**T52**Absence_explanation**None**4**life>> more easy.
