The given graph illustrates how the population of the United States was changing during 250 years.
In 1750 there were less than o<<one million people**T8**Numerals**None**21**one million of people>>in U<<the USA**T2**Articles**None**3**USA>> During n<<the next**T9**Articles**None**4**next>>fifty years, the number of people increased slightly, but still remained o<<at**T10**Prepositions**None**2**on>>approximately s<<the same level.**T1**Articles**None**10**same level>> Till 1800 t<<birth rate**T17**Articles**None**14**the birth rate>>exceeded t<<death rate**T18**Articles**None**14**the death rate>>o<<at**T11**Prepositions**None**2**on>>s<<the same level.**T3**Articles**None**11**same level.>>In 1800 t<<birth rate**T19**lex_item_choice**None**18**the level of birth>>declined slightly, while t<<death rate**T14**lex_item_choice**None**18**the level of death>>dropped dramatically. The population reached 25 million in 1850, when the difference between birth rate and death rate was the m<<largest**T20**lex_item_choice**None**15**most remarkable>> This year was followed by a sudden g<<growth**T12**Category_confusion**None**4**grow>>of population, there already were 8<<80 million people**T13**Numerals**None**21**80 millions of people>>in 1900. This year birth rate still declined, but death rate started to fluctuate. In the first half of 2<<the 20th century**T15**Articles**None**12**20th century>>the population surged by 150 million. For next fifty years t<<birth rate**T4**lex_item_choice**None**18**the level of birth>>bounced back, the n<<population number**T22**Absence_comp_colloc**None**6**number>>changed remarkably and reached its peak in 2000 with approximately 300 million.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the number of citizens in US<<the USA**T16**Articles**None**3**USA>>ncreased moderately for 150 years and grew fast in 20th century, but we should mention that fo<<throughout**T23**Prepositions**None**3**for>>ll th<<these years**T24**Agreement_errors**None**10**this years>>h<<birth rate**T25**Articles**None**14**the birth rate>>xceeded th<<death rate**T26**Articles**None**14**the death rate>>which helped the gr<<growth**T5**Category_confusion**None**4**grow>>
