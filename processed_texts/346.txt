Nowadays small local businesses face one of the most important problems <<which is**T17**Ref_device**None**7**such as>> their replacement by big <<companies**T1**Spelling**None**9**componies>> <<,**T18**Redundant_comp**None**9**which are>> renowned for <<their**T2**Agreement_errors**None**3**its>> <<names and brands**T3**Noun_number**None**14**name and brand>>. I strongly believe that there are more disadvantages rather than advantages.
First of all, it is important to point out that big companies with multinational brands make their goods really expensive, the prices rocket but the quality stays at the same level while small componies are able to sell t<<things**T4**Articles**None**10**the things>>of good quality and t<<prices**T6**Articles**None**10**the prices>>are not so high. This will help n<<less wealthy**T5**Prefix**None**11**not wealthy>>people to have an opportunity to buy such things.
Moreover, multinational co<<companies**T7**Spelling**None**9**componies>>re not eager to come up with new ideas. They have a famous brand and th<<customers**T20**Articles**None**13**the customers>>ho are eager to buy their goods while small local shops can give th<<buyers**T8**Articles**None**10**the buyers>> lot of new and original goods and ma<<make**T25**Redundant**None**7**make up>>omething new and extraordinary. There are a lot of similar things (clothes/shoes) in big famous shops which are worn by a lot of people everywhere. Sometimes people are em<<embarrassed**T19**Spelling**None**10**embarassed>>hen they meet people in the same clothes or trainers.
However, there are some disadvantages. For example, shop ass<<assistants**T9**Spelling**None**10**assistents>>e rea<<extremely**T21**lex_item_choice**None**6**really>>lite in mul<<shops belonging to multinational companies**T10**Absence_explanation**None**23**multinational companies>>hey are always ready to hel<<help**T11**Spelling**None**4**hels>>ients, to offer tea<<some tea or coffee**T12**Determiners**None**13**tea or coffee>>hey can<<are never**T22**Absence_explanation**None**8**can't be>>de and<<or**T26**Conjunctions**None**3**and>>ressive. There are underlaying causes why. The main cause is that such com<<companies**T13**Spelling**None**9**componies>>ve nam<<a good name**T16**Articles**None**9**good name>>d they just can't afford to spoil all<<their image**T27**Redundant_comp**None**36**all good comments of their customers>>ll in all, it is important to point out that although there are pros<<cons, pros**T28**suggestion**None**10**pros, cons>>number them. Small local businesses have to be developed and the government should tackle this problem and to t<<take**T16**Lack_par_constr**None**7**to take>>sures like introducing more taxes for big companies or some restrictions for them.
