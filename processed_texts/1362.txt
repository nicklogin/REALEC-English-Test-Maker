It is <<acceptable**T1**Category_confusion**None**8**accepted>> to think that <<the using**T2**Articles**None**5**using>> of modern technologies is the reason of <<the increasing**T49**Articles**None**6**rising>> amount of deseases. Moreover, there are some health problems and <<there are solutions that lead to decreasing the number of such  diseases**T5**Absence_comp_sent**None**63**solutions that lead to decreasing the number of such a diseases>><<diseases**T7**Articles**None**11**a deseases.>> 
Generally speaking, the majority of health problems concerned to modern <<technologies**T9**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> can develop due to overusing <<them**T11**Ref_device**None**8**that one>>. It is clear that technologies exist for <<quite a long time**T13**Standard**None**17**a quite long time>> and could not be as damaging as <<the first ones**T12**Articles**None**10**first ones>>. For example, monitors #DELETE#12#of computers became more healthy and have <<less impact**T15**Articles**None**13**a less impact>> on eyes <<than**T16**Often_confused**None**4**then>> they had in the end of the 20th century. Nevertheless, <<techniques**T17**Spelling**None**10**technicues>> <<develop**T18**Voice**None**13**are developed>>, <<scientists**T19**Spelling**None**11**sciencitist>> research and <<deal**T21**lex_item_choice**None**4**work>> with all problems they face, so it is not smart to deny results of their <<work**T22**lex_item_choice**None**7**actions>>. 
However, people still have health problems <<when they use modern technologies**T23**Absence_explanation**None**25**using modern technologies>> and they need to <<tackle them**T49**Transitive**None**6**tackle>> or avoid <<them**T26**Ref_device**None**2**it>>. The successful example of avoiding the <<problem**T27**Noun_number**None**8**problems>> of sleeping is <<using phones, laptops or computers twho hours at least before going to bed**T29**Standard**None**90**using phones, laptops or computers the last time before going to bed in two hours at least>>. <<Consequently**T30**Spelling**None**15**Consequencently>>, people who had insomnia before #DELETE#17#this new behavior noticed that #DELETE#5#later their <<sleep**T33**Category_confusion**None**8**sleeping>> became <<steady**T34**Category_confusion**None**5**stead>> and calm. Moreover, <<decreasing**T35**Gerund_phrase**None**13**decreasing of>> <<the time**T36**Articles**None**4**time>> spent on reading news in the Internet, for example, can help people who <<have been**T49**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> too anxious or nervous for a long period of time. As a result, they can spend <<their**T39**Spelling**None**3**the>> free time to relax and eventually <<their stress level decreases**T40**Confusion_of_structures**None**27**decrease their stress level>>.
In <<conclusion**T41**Articles**None**12**a conclusion>>, people still have some health issues due to using some sorts of modern technologies, in spite of the fact that <<they**T42**Ref_device**None**9**this ones>> are more safe nowadays. #DELETE#16#It is clear that <<It**T44**Capitalisation**Dependent_change**2**it>> is a complex problem which may not have <<a perfect solution**T46**Articles**None**20**any perfect solution>>, but it will be good to do at least <<some of these actions**T48**Absence_comp_colloc**None**16**of these actions>> that can help people to cope with the majority #DELETE#10#widespread of problems.
