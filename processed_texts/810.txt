Nowadays there are a lot of arguments about impact of large buisnesses on small.
One people think that a large bisnesses replace local, but others don't believe in this.
In my view benefits of caurse outwaigt the disadvantages. Firsly, a big buiseness is always good. We live in a huge city whith the great number of population and we need to live with comfortable.For example, nowadays we have a lot of supermarkets, big shops and it made our shopping more comfortable. We can find all things or products that we need in one place and dont waste our time.
In favour of this statement is that in big places there were a lot of parkings places for people with cars or a lot of entertaiment places for children. Perents always can leave their children there and go to shopping.
The argument against big buisnesses is that local bisnesses have a lot of benifits. For example small buisnedd such as a small shop on the street have not a lot of people and if you need you can go there and buy what you need very quickly and save your time.Usually in such shops the products are more fresh. It is very grate for our health. To sum up, I want to say that as a proverb goes "How many people, so many minds". I think that small buisness is good, but big is better. We need to depend our cities, contries and today we have a great opportunity to do it.
