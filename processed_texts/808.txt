Today more and more young people commit crimes. This fact may transform a young society to a dangerous environment.
The problem is the absence of the moral education among the young people. If they commit crimes, they can be risen in unlucky families. The good solution for this problem is the control of social or state institutions of the attitude to these children in families. The social worker can see if the parents of a child rise him or her in good condition. Otherwise social workers can help a child to develop in more suitable conditions. The dark side of this solution is the true life that can not be so fair to you and sometimes these children stay in bad families and tempted to commit crimes.
The second solutions to the problem of rocketing of crimes by young people is the moral help and education in the schools. Young children should be able to go to a free school psycologist which can be a good secret conversationalist and help with problems or say what and how is better to do.The disadvantage of it is the misunderstanding of the specialist, that is why the cause of the conversations may be dramatical. A child can make decisions on his or her own for example, by disappearing from the family, making suicidal actions, start or continue commiting crimes.
All in all, the problem of commiting crimes by the young people is one of the serious social problem that should not be ignored.
