Some part of humanity thinks that countries should import to other countries a minimum part of food which <<is produced**T1**Voice**None**8**produces>> in this <<country.**T2**Punctuation**None**8**country,>> And <<the amount of food should be equal to the**T3**lex_item_choice**None**38**the food should be the same value with>> food which population needs. I am disagree with this statement and I will try to explain why. 

First of all, there are some countries in the world which <<cannot**T4**Spelling**None**7**can not>> produce as much food as <<its**T5**Spelling**None**5**it is>> population needs. <<So**T6**Spelling**None**2**SO>> other countries can help such countries and <<its**T7**Spelling**None**4**it’s>> people to survive by <<importing**T8**Tense_choice**None**6**import>> some food to them. Also some countries <<do not have**T10**Tense_choice**None**12**have not got>> a special <<equipment**T9**Spelling**None**9**aquipment>> for producing any type of <<food**T11**Spelling**None**4**doof>> or in this region some species of plants cannot grow or <<some**T12**lex_item_choice**None**7**kind of>> <<animals**T13**Spelling**None**7**anymals>> cannot live. But <<these**T15**Ref_device**None**4**this>> <<countries**T14**Spelling**None**9**countryes>> can produce other <<types**T16**Noun_number**None**4**type>> of resources. So countries can excnenge thir goods, or sell some products, with they have to earn money and buy food or something else from another country.  Secondly, if <<a country**T17**Articles**None**7**country>> can produce more food than <<its**T18**Spelling**None**4**it’s>> population can eat, <<such**T19**Spelling**None**5**souch>> country will be able to sell <<the part of food**T20**Articles**None**14**a part of food>> which <<it**T22**Ref_device**Dependent_change**4**they>> <<does not**T21**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**don’t>> need to earn some money and improve the live of population of this country or it can solve some problems which this county has (<<for example,**T23**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> problems with bad roads). 

In conclusion, I can say that it is really necessary for all of us and for all countries to help each other with food. That is why countries, which can produce more food than they need, should do that and give or sell this food to other countries.
