<<The growth**T17**Articles**None**4**Grow>> of <<level**T20**lex_item_choice**None**6**amount>> of crimes <<committed**T1**Spelling**None**8**commited>> by young people is a serious problem of our society. To find how we can solve this <<problem,**T18**Punctuation**None**7**problem>> firstly we have to find the <<reasons for**T4**Prepositional_noun**None**10**reasons of>> it.
<<In my opinion,**T6**Punctuation**None**13**In my opinion>> <<the first**T5**Articles**None**5**first>> reason is gender <<equality:**T10**Punctuation**None**8**equality>> nowadays the percentage of <<women**T8**Derivation**None**6**womens>> who <<have**T9**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> a job is higher than ever before, <<therefore,**T19**Punctuation**None**9**therefore>> they <<have**T11**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> less time <<to take**T7**Infinitive_constr**None**8**for take>> care of their children. <<So,**T13**Punctuation**None**2**So>> children <<have**T12**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> more freedom than ever before.
Another reason is the Internet. Nowadays majority of young people has free access to <<the Internet**T14**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. They can use it <<to find**T15**Infinitive_constr**None**8**for find>> any kind of forbidden information, while their <<parents**T16**Noun_number**Dependent_change**6**parent>> <<don't know**T17**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**12**doesnâ€™t know>> about it.
