The bar chart illustrates data about printed book and eBook markets in the USA, Germany, China, the UK from 2014 to 2018. All numbers <<are given**T1**Modals**None**5**given>> in billion US dollars.
The common tendency is that print market is the most popular in each of <<the four**T13**Articles**None**3**for>> countries in 2014 (10,5 versus 5,5 in the USA, 6 versus 1 in Germany, 4,8 versus 4,2 in China and so on). Moreover, this is the largest market in general, #DELETE#2#in comparing even with markets in 2018 (except Germany: print market there in 2014 <<is equal to**T5**Prepositions**None**8**is equal>> printed part in 2018 - six billion dollars). But it is absolutely clear, that after four years from describing situation the part of printed books <<will**T6**Tense_choice**Dependent_change**2**is>> gradually <<fall**T7**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**falls>> (in the USA it hits 7,5 billion dollars, in China it <<decreases**T9**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**8**decrease>> from 4,8 to 4,2, and in Great Britain printed book market <<loses**T11**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**4**lose>> 0,6 billion dollars). In Germany situation is stable. In contrast, the part of eBook increases in all these countries (in the USA it rises from 5,5 to 8,5; in Germany it <<rises**T13**Spelling**None**6**raises>> from 1 to 1,5. Chinese market of eBook rises significantly 1 versus 0,5 and in the UK we can see uprising from 1,8 to 2,3 since 2014.
Finally, we can emphasise that eBook market rises meanwhile printed book market constantly decreases through 4 years.
