The first evident feature in <<the chart**T5**Articles**None**5**chart>> is that <<on average**T6**lex_part_choice**None**10**in average>> men spend more time doing sport in England than women do. The biggest gap between two genders is <<at**T8**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the age 16-24. The older <<the age**T10**Articles**None**3**age>> #DELETE#2#is, the less <<the gap**T11**Articles**None**3**gap>> #DELETE#2#is. Only in <<age group**T13**Absence_comp_colloc**None**3**age>> 55-64 women spend more time on sport and exercise than men.
The common t<<tendency**T1**Suffix**None**10**tendention>>is that both genders spend less time doing sport w<<when getting older**T3**lex_part_choice**None**18**with getting older>> Although, women's time spent on sport decreases gradually with age, while men are o<<obviously**T2**Spelling**None**8**obviosly>>much more into sports in t<<in their youth**T14**Determiners**None**9**the youth>> The gap in the young age between men and women is 168 minutes and i<<at**T16**Prepositions**None**2**in>>the age over 75 it is only 19,2 minutes.
All in all, the chart shows that in En<<England**T17**Spelling**None**7**Englang>>oung men in<<of**T18**lex_item_choice**None**6**in age>>6-24 are keen on sports in<<on average**T19**lex_part_choice**None**10**in average>>nd young women are not really, but through their lives all people spend some time of the day on sports, even men and women who are over 75 years old, and that feels inspiring to me.
