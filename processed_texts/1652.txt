Illegal drugs in sport is one of most <<challenging**T322**lex_item_choice**None**9**struggled>> problems nowadays. Some people believe that consequence of using drugs by sportsmen should be denying participance of that athlet for <<a limited period**T323**Articles**None**14**limited period>>. While <<others**T324**Redundant_comp**None**22**another part of people>> claim that punishment should be <<stricter**T325**Spelling**None**8**stricker>> - banning for the rest of their lives. This essay will demonstrate two different points of view.
Athletes should be given a punishment - 2 years without any <<competitions**T320**Spelling**None**11**competitons>>. People, that support that point of view, highlight situations when sportsmen didn't know that <<they**T326**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> used illegal drugs: for example, because of new rules or <<because their**T327**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> doctor was not aware of essential information and <<gave them**T328**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**gave>> illegal medicines. Another reason is that everyone, including sportsmen, has a chance for mistake and if <<a sportsman**T329**Noun_number**None**9**sporstmes>> was punished, banned for some period of time, he would not try to do it again.
Although the majority claims that the <<athletes**T321**Spelling**None**8**althetes>> should be banned for 2 years, there is a group of people with <<a contrary point of view**T330**Articles**None**22**contrary point of view>>. Sport is very <<a fair part**T331**Articles**None**9**fair part>> of <<live,**T332**Punctuation**None**4**live>> and using illegal drugs <<influences**T333**Noun_number**None**9**influence>> rules of sport. Moreover, that illegal <<medicine**T335**Noun_number**None**9**medicines>> <<gives**T336**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**4**give>> more chances to win for participants from developed countries because they can provide their athletes <<modern drugs developed using modern technologies**T338**Confusion_of_structures**None**40**contemporary drugs by modern techologies>> while developing countries cannot afford it because of lack of money and <<qualified**T339**Often_confused**None**12**qualificated>> <<specialists**T340**lex_item_choice**None**8**scholars>>. Furthermore, they believe that if <<a sportsman**T341**Articles**None**8**sportman>> uses illegal drugs he <<breaks**T342**Conditionals**None**5**broke>> <<the rules**T343**Articles**None**5**rules>> of world sports community and <<cannot**T344**Conditionals**None**9**could not>> be its member again.
Hence, I believe that if the <<an athlete**T355**Articles**None**6**athlet>> <<uses**T347**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**use>> drugs <<for the first time**T349**Absence_comp_colloc**None**10**first time>>, <<he**T352**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> should be banned for 2 <<years,**T350**Punctuation**None**5**years>> but <<if he**T351**Absence_explanation**None**2**if>> more than once, <<he**T353**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> should be punished by banning for the rest of <<his**T354**Inappropriate_register**None**5**their>> lives. To sum up, that topic is very <<controversial**T355**lex_item_choice**None**10**discussive>> nowadays and opponents are arguing till today.
