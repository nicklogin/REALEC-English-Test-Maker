Someone thinks that countries only need to produce the food for people and <<should not**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn’t>> <<import**T2**Spelling**None**5**iport>> <<anything**T3**lex_item_choice**None**9**something>><<. This**T4**Punctuation**None**6**, This>> is an interesting idea and I will argue it with relevant examples and <<evidences**T5**Noun_number**None**8**evidence>>. 

First of all, #DELETE#4#only producing food is #DELETE#2#to the one important thing that people want. All people must have clothes, electronics, furniture in <<their**T8**Ref_device**None**3**own>> houses and etc. <<If**T9**Spelling**None**2**It>> <<a country**T10**Articles**None**7**country>> <<does not have**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**6**hasn’t>> any special factories or <<manufactories**T12**Spelling**None**13**manifacturies>> on the territory it must buy goods and products abroad. This is all usually people’s equipments that government must fulfil<< using different opportunities**T13**Punctuation**None**31**, using different opportunities>>. <<If this is not happening, people will be unhappy and angry**T15**Conditionals**None**52**If it all willn’t that people will unhappy and angry>>. People will not be able to fulfil <<their**T16**Ref_device**None**3**own>> requirements because <<many goods**T18**lex_item_choice**None**12**mostly goods>> will be very expensive or even <<will not be presented**T19**lex_item_choice**None**23**is not been able to buy>> in shops or somewhere. In conclusion, humans will #DELETE#3#can go abroad <<, that is**T21**Punctuation**None**7**that is>> very bad factor for every country. 

On the other hand, it is <<an interesting idea**T22**Articles**None**16**interesting idea>> to separate countries and people. Every country and government exist <<independent from**T23**Prepositions**None**14**independent on>> others. All uses <<their own**T24**Absence_explanation**None**3**own>> resourses that they have and produce goods and food that they <<can**T25**lex_item_choice**None**10**able to do>>. In this situation <<the cultures**T37**Articles**None**7**colture>> of countries cannot <<change**T28**Category_confusion**None**8**changing>> because of no import of unknown goods and food. Also, it is <<a way**T29**Articles**None**3**way>> to full <<distance**T30**lex_item_choice**None**8**stopping>> between countries and governments. <<Every**T31**Spelling**None**5**Ebery>> country has only <<its**T32**lex_item_choice**None**3**own>> materials and food and <<does not**T33**Agreement_errors**None**5**don’t>> exchange with others. As a result, in <<the world**T35**Articles**None**5**world>> <<there will be**T34**Confusion_of_structures**None**9**will stay>> undestroyed strong friendship between countries and people in different parts of Earth. 

In conclusion I would say that all countries must fulfill <<requirements**T36**Noun_number**None**11**requirement>> of <<its**T37**Ref_device**None**3**own>> population using different ways.
