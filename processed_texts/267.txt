Is it right to download music or films on the Internet? If “yes”, what will be a <<punishment**T1**Category_confusion**None**8**punished>>?
Nowadays, more and more people <<are coping and sharing**T2**Tense_form**None**19**copying and sharing>> music or films on the <<Internet**T3**Countable_uncountable**None**9**Internets>> for free, but most of them <<do not**T4**Spelling**None**7**don not>> understand that every year musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money from illegal pirate copies.
On the <<one**T5**Spelling**None**2**on>> hand, <<it is useful**T6**Abs_comp_clause**None**9**it useful>> for all people because you can find <<on**T8**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet every film and music that you want <<, not standing up from the sofa**T10**Punctuation**None**29**not standing up from the sofa>>. Moreover, the huge <<number**T11**Often_confused**None**6**amount>> of films and musics is free <<on**T12**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the Internet**T13**Articles**None**8**Internet>>.
On the other hand, the film <<producers**T14**Lack_par_constr**None**8**producer>> and musicians suffer every year losing <<their**T15**Agreement_errors**None**3**his>> money, because of people<< who download pirate copies on the Internet**T16**Defining**None**44**, who download pirate copies on the Internet>>. 
In my personal point of view, I think that copying and sharing music or films on the Internet and people who download <<these files**T17**Abs_comp_clause**None**5**these>> should not be punished, because now going to cinema, for example, is not cheap and not many people can go there every week. Every day I <<listen to**T18**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> different kind of <<music**T19**Countable_uncountable**None**6**musics>> and see one or may be two films on the Internet.
<<To summarize all previous facts,**T21**Punctuation**None**31**To summarize all previous facts>> I want to say that <<there**T23**lex_item_choice**None**2**it>> should not be <<a punishment**T24**Articles**None**10**punishment>> for copying and sharing music or films on the Internet, and <<what about musicians and film producers,**T25**Punctuation**None**39**what about musicians and film producers>> they got enough of money and with illegal pirate copies, <<if someone really likes one group or film,**T29**Punctuation**None**41**if someone really likes one group or film>> he will go to the concert or <<to**T28**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the cinema.
