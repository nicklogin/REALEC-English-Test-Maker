The provided pie charts reveals the data about six goods which are <<transported**T2**Spelling**None**10**transpoted>> by rail and by road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008. It is <<noticeable**T3**Spelling**None**10**noticiable>> that metals, machinery, <<manufactured**T4**Spelling**None**12**manufacturad>> goods, chemicals, non-metallic minerals and food products are traded using #DELETE#2#as the road and so the rails, too. Nevertheless, the diagrams look <<completely**T6**Spelling**None**9**comlitely>> different.
The main feature of the first diagram is that the metals are transported by the trains more than other goods.It takes almost 1/3 part of the diagram. While the food products s<<show**T7**Agreement_errors**None**5**shows>>the same result as the most transported g<<goods**T8**Noun_number**None**4**good>>with the cars. The second popular g<<goods**T9**Noun_number**None**4**good>>for transportation by train and at the same time by the road i<<are**T10**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>>manufactured products.
The rest 1/3 part of the first pie-chart goes for food products, machinery, and no<<non-metallic**T11**Spelling**None**12**non-minallic>>ineral as 11, 12, 8 o/o respectively. Likewise, the 1/3 of the second chart are for non-metallic minerals, machinery and metals - 13, 2, 11 o/o respectively. Thus, we can state that machinery isn't the most transported good as using the rails and road either.
