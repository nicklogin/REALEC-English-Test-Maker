<<A. Orlenko**T1**ADV**None**8**Nowadays>> there is <<a popular opinion**T301**Articles**None**15**popular opinion>> that the number of health problems is becoming <<larger**T314**lex_item_choice**None**6**bigger>> and <<larger**T315**lex_item_choice**None**6**bigger>> because of <<the widespread use**T316**Articles**None**14**widespread use>> of modern technology. And <<hence, a question arises**T302**Standard**None**22**here arises a question>>: is it really so?
Unfortunately, today we can really witness that people suffer from different problems connected with <<health**T317**Spelling**None**5**heath>>. For example, a lot of people have bad eyesight due to using phones and watching TV very often. Another <<problem, which is more dangerous and serious,**T303**Non_defining**None**43**problem which is more dangerous and serious>> is that there is <<an information overload**T318**Articles**None**20**information overload>> in our modern world. Because of a lot of messages, phone calls and information people <<suffer from**T312**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> stress and depression, which <<leads**T319**Tense_form**None**4**lead>> to nervous <<breakdowns**T320**lex_part_choice**None**6**breaks>>.
It goes without saying that some measures should be taken. <<From my point of view,**T310**Punctuation**None**21**From my point of view>> the only way to solve these problems is to reduce <<the time**T304**Articles**None**4**time>> which we spend using our telephones, computers and <<not to waste**T305**Lack_par_constr**None**9**not waste>> time sitting near the television set. A wonderful solution is to have <<an active way**T306**Articles**None**10**active way>> of life. For example, people need to go out and go for a walk more often, to do sports, fitness exercises. We should communicate with our friends and relatives in real life, and not by using social <<networks**T321**lex_part_choice**None**4**nets>>. Finally, another way to reduce time we waste on modern technology is to search information, write essays and study by going to the library but not searching the Internet.
<<In conclusion,**T307**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I would like to emphasize that the widespread use of modern technology can lead to essential <<consequences**T308**Spelling**None**12**consequances>> connected with problems with our health like bad eyesight, nervous <<breakdowns**T322**lex_part_choice**None**6**breaks>>. Special measures should be taken immediately <<, and**T313**Punctuation**None**3**and>> the only way to solve this problem is to reduce <<the time**T309**Articles**None**4**time>> which we spend using technology.
