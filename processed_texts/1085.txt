It goes without saying that music and films are play the great role in pearson’s life. The Internet provide us a lot of information, including multimedia, Movies, pictures, soundtracks from favourite film - all of this things you can find on special websites or online-programms. But is good to download a film or an album from The Internet for free?

At first it is illigal. When you make copies of film or a music without author’s permission - you can be punished. Every pearson who has rights on his intellectual property can provide you a lisence. The lisence can be printed on the product, for examle, on a disk-box. In Internet, you buy this product from official distrybutor.

But on the other hand, there is no controll in Internet and everybody can use stolen videos for free. The problem is that a huge amount of people do not know the law and do not wat research which film was stolen and which film was downloaded for free by its owner.

Secondly, people may be punished for damaging whole musical or cinematography industry. Every stolen cent can be critial for some music bands, every copy can seriosly harm people, who create movie. It is very serious problem and it affects media business.

On the contrary, it is impossible to punish all people who break this law. The majority of Internet-users wathched illigal copy of film or listened a pirate album at least once. Of course government have an opportunity to penalize thousends of citizens inside country.

To sum up, this problem is really very difficult and actual nowadays. The lawmakers should think about how to prevent pirates copies spreading, but users, who download product for themelves, should not be punished.
