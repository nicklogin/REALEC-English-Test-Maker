The problem of <<illegal sharing the media content**T1**Absence_explanation**None**15**illegal sharing>> <<that**T2**Often_confused**None**5**which>> leads to financial problems of musicians and film producers is very controversial nowadays. Some people think that people who <<copy**T3**Tense_choice**None**7**copying>> and <<share**T4**Tense_choice**None**7**sharing>> music on the Internet should be punished, others disagree with them and believe that there should be a freedom in this case.
People who are for punishing provide rather strong arguments <<of**T5**Prepositions**None**3**for>> their position. First of all, they believe that copying and sharing is very harmful for <<musicians**T6**Articles**None**13**the musicians>> and it can lead to <<a bad financial situation**T7**Articles**None**27**the bad financial situation>> of <<a famous person**T8**Articles**None**17**the famous person>>. They should only sell their products. Secondly, they think that sharing can be considered as <<an ignorance**T9**Articles**None**13**the ignorance>> of the rights of an artist. Because sometimes <<, for example,**T10**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> film producers have a plan of how to present their film <<, and**T12**Punctuation**None**3**and>> if someone <<shares**T11**Agreement_errors**None**5**share>> the info about the film before the debut <<, it**T13**Punctuation**None**2**it>> would be disrespectful <<to**T14**Prepositions**None**3**for>> the labour of the film producer.
But there are some people who do not <<support**T15**lex_item_choice**None**5**share>> this point of view. Firstly, they believe that now<<, when we are living in the post-industrial world,**T16**Punctuation**None**49**, when we are living in the post-industrial world>> we should have the right to copy and share all the information we get. Moreover, they believe that usually <<, when some information about a film is shared on the Internet,**T17**Punctuation**None**60**when some information about a film is shared on the Internet>> it only has a positive impact on the amount of money <<that**T21**Often_confused**None**5**which>> <<the producer**T22**Articles**None**8**producer>> <<will get**T23**Tense_choice**None**3**get>> from the film. It <<helps**T24**Agreement_errors**None**4**help>> to boost interest in the internet sphere. And finally, they <<are sure**T25**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**sure>> that sometimes it is the only way to listen to some new music. or to watch a film <<, because**T27**Punctuation**None**7**because>> nowadays <<a price**T28**Articles**None**9**the price>> of <<a cinema ticket**T29**Articles**None**17**the cinema ticket>> is rather high <<, as well as**T30**Punctuation**None**10**as well as>> <<a price**T31**Articles**None**9**the price>> of <<an MP3 disc**T32**Articles**None**12**the MP3 disc>>.
To sum up, there is no correct <<answer**T33**Noun_number**None**7**answers>> <<to**T34**Prepositions**None**3**for>> this kind of questions <<, because**T35**Punctuation**None**7**because>> it all depends on <<an attitude**T36**Articles**None**12**the attitude>> of <<a person**T37**Articles**None**10**the person>>. The position of people who are for the freedom of copying and sharing is closer to my attitude.
