<<Music**T1**lex_item_choice**None**9**Musicians>>, films and books are our best companions and <<sources**T2**Noun_number**None**6**source>> of knowledge and joy from our infant time <<until**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**4**till>> the end of life. But <<most**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**many>> of <<this**T4**Ref_device**None**5**these>> stuff we could not <<get or find legally**T6**Standard**None**19**get legally or find>>, so should we use tricks?

My position is that it is normal to download some films or music<<which**T7**Punctuation**None**7**; which>> are rare, but <<, in fact,**T8**Punctuation**None**8**in fact,>> nowadays almost nobody buy discs<< because**T9**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> they are #DELETE#5#litle ‘acient goods’. It is much more convinient to have movies and music <<on your phone**T11**Prepositions**None**13**in your phone>> or in computer memory.

<<On the one hand,**T12**Punctuation**None**15**On the one hand>> we understand that art provides <<the lose of**T13**Prepositions**None**4**lose>> money when people <<download**T14**Tense_choice**None**11**downloading>> and <<share**T15**Tense_choice**None**7**sharing>> music or films instead of going to the cinema. <<It**T16**Ref_device**None**4**That>> is an issue in t<<movie and music industries**T17**Articles**None**29**he movie and music industries>>, but in real life <<many people**T19**Prepositions**None**14**many of people>> just <<do not have**T20**Negation**None**8**have not>> an opportunity to visit a cinema so often or buy <<a huge amount**T21**Articles**None**11**huge amount>> of music. <<In comparison to**T22**Prepositions**None**18**In comparison with>> ordinary people musicians and film directors earn much money from concerts and film distributors. 

<<To conclude my thoughts,**T23**Punctuation**None**23**To conclude my thoughts>> I guess that buying <<original versions**T25**Articles**None**21**the original versions>> of movies and music must be decided individually by ourselves. Someone <<needs**T26**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> <<a better quality**T27**Articles**None**14**better quality>> of a sound and <<picture**T28**Articles**None**9**a picture>> so that he or she could buy the originals, but <<those who**T29**Absence_explanation**None**3**who>> just need a first-hand acquaintance with <<something**T30**Inappropriate_register**None**4**smth>> can get it illegally and I suppose that <<they**T32**Ref_device**None**2**it>> <<should not**T31**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn’t>> be punished.
