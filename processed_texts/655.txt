The information given depicts the average <<maximum**T1**Spelling**None**7**maximun>> and minimum temperatures in certain towns, namely in Yakutsk in Russia and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.The data are provided in the amount of degrees <<Celsius**T2**Spelling**None**7**Celcies>> per each month during the year.
It can be deduced from the graph that the average minimum temperature in Rio de Janeiro remained practically unchanged at the temperature of 22 degrees C<<Celsius**T3**Spelling**None**7**Celcies>>over zero. Similarly, the maximum temperature was stable throughout the whole period under discussion at approximately 30 degrees C<<Celsius**T5**Spelling**None**7**Celsies>>over zero. Thus, the average maximum and minimum temperature there somehow stagnates between 20 and 30 degrees C<<Celsius**T4**Spelling**None**7**Celcies>>respectively.
Speaking about Ya<<Yakutsk**T6**Spelling**None**7**Yarkuts>>the minimum temperature fl<<fluctuated**T14**Spelling**None**10**flactuated>>t about 40 degrees Ce<<Celsius**T7**Spelling**None**7**Celcies>>elow zero, achieving its peak at the temperature of 10 degrees Ce<<Celsius**T8**Spelling**None**7**Celcies>>ver zero in July. It demonstrates a five-time increase. While the minimum average temperature there fl<<fluctuated**T15**Spelling**None**10**flactuated>>t the level of 35 degrees Ce<<Celsius**T10**Spelling**None**7**Celcies>>elow zero, having the peak at 25 degrees Ce<<Celsius**T11**Spelling**None**7**Celcies>>ver zero in July. This illustrates a sixfold rise. So, the average minimum and maximum temperature in Ya<<Yakutsk**T13**Spelling**None**8**Yarkutsk>>hows the upward trend in the first part of the period and the downward trend in the second, returning to the previous level of temperature.
Overall, summarizing all information provided it can be stated that the average temperatures in Rio de Janeiro are constantly about 20 or 30 degrees cel<<Celsius**T9**Spelling**None**7**celcies>>er zero during the whole year. At the same time the average temperatures in Yakutsk went down maximum to 35 degrees Cel<<Celsius**T12**Spelling**None**7**Celcies>>low zero, then had the peak at the level of 25 over zero and ,finally, went back to the last temperature. As we can see, the average temperature in Yakutsk is unpredictably high in July, as it is in Rio de Janeiro, and totally lit<<low**T17**lex_item_choice**None**6**little>> the rest part of the year.
