Every year musicians and film producers have a big problems with illegal pirate sharing their work on the Internet. It is easy to find fresh, just introducted, film or music album in social networks and special downlouding sites. But it is so hard to find person, who can be responsible and punished for this. Is it right? Musical and film industry’ product should be free or we have to punish people, who make pirat copies?

There are two sides of the question. In my opinion, making copies is illegal business. Person, who make money by this must be punished. To do music album, to take videos and new film is not free too. You need in a huge amount of money to pay all professionals: composers, scenarists, operators, casting-directors, artists, producers. And this will be stange if you would present your job for free. If you are not a millioner and philantrop, of course.

Pirat coping and sharing should be punished because it help for plagearism. People can downloud music, to make a little changes and then to say that they did it themselves. So, using platforms such as Apple Music (AppStore) is more safer than Vlc player, for examples. Many producers also use YouTube official channels for introduction new clips, videos or just a music treck.

On the other hand, pirate sharing of new films and music help it become more popular. Great amount of social networs users do reposts, send a messages for friends with new song of their favourite singer. The more reposts - the more audience, listeners and followers. It is the main aim of all artists, isn’t it?

To sum up everything, I can say that I agree that pirate coping and sharing music or films on the Internet should be punished. It is not right behind the creator. In my opinion, people, who made something new, should get money, but not man who just copied this.
