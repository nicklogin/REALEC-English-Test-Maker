The issue concerning the use of drugs which are prohibited among the sportsmen elicits a lot of controversy today. Some people believe that those athletes whose blame was proved must not have the opportunity to <<continue**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**5**go on>> their sport career. Others, however, are sure that a chance should <<should always be given**T2**Word_choice**None**14**be always done>> to anybody and in any case, especially regarding <<entertainment**T13**Spelling**None**12**entertamment>> sphere, which they refer sport to. <<In this essay,**T9**Punctuation**None**13**In this essay>> both points of view will be discussed and <<my own will be presented**T10**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**my own presented>>.
On the one hand, using illegal drugs is a serious crime. People who tend to punish sportsmen for the rest of their lives <<point out this fact**T8**Prepositions**None**22**point out to this fact>> and label accused athletes as "crimers" with a "psychology of a crimer". This means that such sportsmen will in any case try to repeat this illegal experience and, what is more, in a more complicated way, <<takes**T7**Agreement_errors**None**6**taking>> previous "mistakes" into account. To my mind, such a generalization has little grounds as all people are different.
On the other hand, people must always have a chance as any crimer has, others claim. There are different examples of change in peoples' <<personalities**T14**Word_choice**None**11**mentalities>> after such precedents. One can remember <<a Russian famous biathlete**T16**Determiners**None**24**Russian famous biathlete>> D. Yaroshenko, who was caught <<consuming**T6**Word_choice**None**6**eating>> prohibited substences with his food. As he admitted, he was too young and very ambitious that time. However, after being banned from competing for 2 years, he was able to return in professional sport and has not repeated the mistake.
I full-heartedly support the idea that athletes should not be punished forever, as there is one more serious argument for such a stance. Sometimes, sportsmen even do not know about the drugs they consume as their coaches add them into the food #DELETE#15#an athlete eats. There also can be some technical mistakes during the <<blood test**T17**Word_choice**None**14**blood analysis>> #DELETE#9#performed.
To conclude, I would like to stress that although those sportsmen who let themselves use illegal drugs are breaking the law and must be punished for this, there is no sense in full-life banning them from sport as they can realise their mistakes and continue their <<career**T4**Spelling**None**7**carrier>> in an <<honest**T5**Spelling**None**5**hones>> way and there are also different factors described in this essay which should be taken into consideration (technical mistakes, for instance<<).**T2**Punctuation**None**1**)>>
