Nowadays we live in the age of consumption. Every single person works to acquire goods such as food, clothes, vehicles, gadgets and more. Along with this trend huge corporations are coming to the arena, offering high-quality (or not) products and professional customer service devouring small local businesses. In this essay I want to discuss the pros and cons of this problem.
Firstly, the domination of a brand increases the chance of monopolization, which is damaging for the economy of the country and for the customers. The corporation gets the power to dictate the rules of the market such as lowest price range for the product and making the situation worse for the other producers.
Secondly, thriving corporations give us less freedom as the consumers. The root of the problem is the decrease of the opportunities for small businesses. The less the competitivenes among businesses the less benefits for the customers. It is widely known that this process is the engine of the economy.
On the other hand, multinational brands provide us with a convenient service, considering it was all done by professionals, maximum comfort and unforgettable shopping experience. That is why the most of us opt for Wallmart as a weekly shopping place. It is more reliable and fast.
Overall, I can say that disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Corporations hurt the national economy and taking our customer freedom. This issues should be tackled by the governments with special legislations to decrease their power.
