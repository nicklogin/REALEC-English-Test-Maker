Is it possible to reduce <<crime level**T39**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**crime>> by giving longer prison sentences <<or**T1**Spelling**None**2**of>> <<are there any**T34**Confusion_of_structures**None**5**is it>> alternative ways? There is no simple <<answer to**T40**Prepositional_noun**None**9**answer on>> <<such a difficult question**T2**Articles**None**23**such difficult question>>. <<As it is widely known,**T36**Absence_comp_sent**None**18**As it widely known>> <<most crimes**T42**Determiners**None**22**the most of the crimes>> are <<committed**T4**lex_item_choice**None**4**made>> by those who <<have already committed**T36**lex_item_choice**None**12**already made>> them. Potentially people who <<have already been**T6**Tense_choice**None**11**are already>> in prison <<are more likely**T44**Word_choice**None**17**have more chances>> to <<commit**T7**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> a crime <<, so**T8**Punctuation**None**2**so>> it could be a good idea to <<keep**T45**lex_item_choice**None**4**take>> them <<in prison longer**T46**Word_order**None**16**longer in prison>> but after all they <<will still**T47**Word_order**None**10**still will>> be <<released**T9**lex_item_choice**None**5**exit.>> The longer sentences <<can make**T54**Modals**None**8**can made>> <<a prisoner**T57**Articles**None**8**prisoner>> <<angrier**T11**Comparative_adj**None**10**more angry>>. What is the difference <<between 10 yeas and 15 years in prison?**T12**Standard**None**39**in prison between 10 years and 15 years>>? The world around us changes <<, and**T14**Punctuation**None**3**and>> the longer prison sentences means <<it is harder to return**T48**Confusion_of_structures**None**20**the harder returning>> to a normal life in society <<, and thus it**T36**Linking_device**None**2**it>> creates big risks for those who <<have just been released from**T36**Word_choice**None**9**only exit>> <<prison**T51**Articles**None**10**the prison>> after a long <<time**T13**Noun_number**None**5**times>>. The main aim of <<prison**T17**Articles**None**10**the prison>> is to punish and improve <<people**T18**Articles**None**10**the people>>, but does it actually improve <<them**T19**Ref_device**None**6**people>>? <<For example,**T20**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> in some Scandinavian countries prisoners have <<an opportunity**T36**Articles**None**7**ability>> to <<reduce**T23**Spelling**None**6**reduse>> their time in prison by reading some books and then passing <<tests**T24**Articles**None**7**a tests>> <<to check**T25**Infinitive_constr**None**5**about>> <<their knowledge**T53**Determiners**None**9**knowledge>> of <<these**T21**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> books. I think such things can help more than longer prison sentences. The longer <<criminals**T27**lex_item_choice**None**9**prisoners>> are in prison <<, the more**T26**Punctuation**None**8**the more>> it costs <<to**T29**Prepositions**None**3**for>> the government. <<In fact,**T28**Punctuation**None**7**In fact>> those who <<do**T55**Agreement_errors**None**4**does>> not <<commit**T56**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> any crime <<have to**T30**Modals**None**6**should>> pay taxes for <<prisoners**T31**Possessive**None**9**prisoners>> time in prison. It is possible to give them some <<physical**T37**Absence_explanation**None**4**work>> or social work <<for**T32**Prepositions**None**2**at>> which they will earn money to reduce costs for the government. Overall, I think <<there are**T35**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**there>> a lot of better ways to improve people and help them to return to a normal life than <<giving**T33**Gerund_phrase**None**4**give>> <<them**T36**Spelling**None**4**the,>> longer prison sentences.
