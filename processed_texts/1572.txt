Nowadays modern technology is the very basis of information society we live in. There is an opinion that#DELETE#1#, the results of scientific progress are likely to have negative impact on people's <<lives**T2**Spelling**None**5**lifes>>. In particular, technologies can cause diseases.
To begin with, the most famous results of technological progress, the computers, have a detrimental effect on <<eyesight**T13**Compound_word**None**5**sight>>. Individuals spending many hours in front of computers' monitors tend to wear glasses. Moreover, wrong posture, while working with computer for long hours, could badly affect backspine. Furthermore, people are surrounded with a lot of electronic devices everyday. As <<electronic devices**T15**suggestion**None**10**electronic>> produces electro-magnetic wave, it is likely to poorly affect tissues of our body. For example, it is prooved by scientists that#DELETE#1#, talking via cellphone a lot could <<cause**T11**suggestion**None**5**couse>> brain cancer.
Although, the situation is not that desperate. <<Of course,**T4**Spelling**None**9**Of cource>> there are some ways of reducing the harmful effects of modern technologies. First of all, people could <<limit**T5**Spelling**None**6**limite>> the time they spend in front of the computer or talking via phones. In particulary, scientists recommend limit the time spent on phone calls by 30 minutes per day. In this way the probability of causing a brain cancer <<falls**T6**Agreement_errors**None**4**fall>> dramatically. The other way to decrease the number of health problems is the scientific progress. New technologies help to improve electronic devices, so that to make them <<safer**T7**Comparative_adj**None**9**more safe>>.
All things considered, <<there**T8**Spelling**None**4**ther>> is no doubt that modern technologies could cause some <<health**T9**Spelling**None**5**helth>> problems. Nevertheless, people can reduce the detrimental effects of scientific progress.
