That is <<a really hard task**T1**Articles**None**16**really hard task>> for people to organize <<economics**T2**Category_confusion**None**10**economical>> in their countries. Some of them learn hard in the universities and work hard in the government to answer this question. Watching these people provide us information about lots of <<processes**T4**Noun_number**None**7**process>> and producing food for population and import with export is one of them. 

I can agree with <<the statement**T5**Articles**None**9**statement>> that countries need to produce the food that their own population eats  and should aim to import as little as possible. But there is one more obvious thing here. I think it is clear for us that producing <<food**T6**Articles**None**8**the food>> more that <<country's**T7**lex_item_choice**None**5**their>> population eats is <<the better way**T8**Articles**None**10**better way>> for countries. That is my own opinion. 

It is easy to understand that it is <<an excellent way**T9**Articles**None**13**excellent way>> to give food to all your population. There are some reasons. For example, workplaces in food industry. <<If you want to produce more food,**T10**Punctuation**None**32**If you want to produce more food>> you need more resources and workers. That <<solves**T11**Agreement_errors**None**5**solve>> another problem, <<which is called**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**which called>> <<unemployment**T13**Category_confusion**None**10**unemployed>>. <<The second reason**T14**Articles**None**13**Second reason>> is economical and food stability, when other countries have less <<influence on**T15**Prepositions**None**12**influence to>> <<our**T16**Spelling**None**3**out>> country and it gives us <<some protection**T17**lex_item_choice**None**21**something like shield>>. 

<<The second and the last point**T18**Articles**None**25**Second and the last point>> of my view is ‘import and export’. My version of organization <<the food policy**T20**Articles**None**11**food policy>> is decreasing import as possible and increasing export. What does it mean? Decreasing import gives us safe and stable future, where <<our country**T21**Absence_explanation**None**7**country>> can avoid global economical <<problems**T22**Noun_number**None**7**problem>>. On the other side, export gives <<this contry**T23**Absence_explanation**None**7**country>> money (not only that because gold is the way too) and <<makes**T24**Agreement_errors**None**4**make>> the nation rich. <<By the way,**T25**Punctuation**None**10**By the way>> we should avoid corruption.
