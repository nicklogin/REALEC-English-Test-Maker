Some people contribute the increase in number of health problems to the intense use of modern technology. This essay will analyze the main health problems<< that can be caused by use of smartphones**T1**Defining**None**42**, that can be caused by use of smartphones>>, computers, etc. and develop a probable solution <<for**T2**Prepositions**None**2**to>> them. At first, some health problems will be observed and then the potential solution will be described. 

To start with, many people are keen on modern technology and gadgets. They spend too much time looking at their smartphones or computerâ€™s display. <<It**T4**Ref_device**None**4**This>> leads to the harmful consequences <<mostly related**T5**Punctuation**None**15**mostly, related>> to the quality of their vision. But the worsening of the vision is not the last problem with <<the intense usage**T6**Articles**None**13**intense usage>> of gadgets. <<While using them,**T7**Punctuation**None**16**While using them>> people <<usually sit**T8**Tense_choice**None**19**are usually sitting>> somewhere, thus, <<their physical activity decreases**T9**Standard**None**34**decreasing their physical activity>>. 

The solution <<for**T10**Prepositions**None**2**of>> these problems should not restrict or <<substitute**T3**Spelling**None**15**substituntinlly>> the usage of modern technology. <<The potential solution**T11**Articles**None**18**Potential solution>> can use those gadgets to reduce the harmful consequences for the health. For instance, the administration of a city can make a mobile application with some tours ant quests that require people to go outside and have a rest, sometimes using their gadget for navigation or as a source of information about an interesting place or a building in their city. 

To conclude, it is necessary to point out that modern technology is an essential part of our life now and the health problem<< that they cause**T12**Defining**None**18**, that they cause,>> have to be solved more intensively, because the usage of <<them**T15**Ref_device**None**2**it>> will only increase in the future.
