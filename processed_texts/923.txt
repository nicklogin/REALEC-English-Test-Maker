In our modern world it is <<difficult**T6**lex_item_choice**None**4**hard>> not to use technologies - nowadays everybody has them. However, they can influence our health in a bad way. Some of <<those**T7**Agreement_errors**None**4**that>> problems will be discussed in this essay.
First of all, it can cause <<reduction**T1**Articles**None**13**the reduction>> of our vision. Children, adults and even pensioners are <<sitting**T8**Spelling**None**7**seating>> in front of screens most of the day. <<With**T2**Spelling**None**5**Whith>> appearance of smartphones you do not need to have a PC, you can use Internet or <<read**T3**Spelling**None**4**reed>> an electronic book everywhere. Also, it can damage your back. People do not realise in which position they are <<sitting**T4**Spelling**None**7**seating>> while using their phones or computers. Besides, it can cause some psychological problems, as people do not communicate in reality anymore. They <<prefer**T9**Spelling**None**7**prefere>> to be alone in their apartment, listening to their music on iPod or watching films on computer or chating with friends by mobile phones.
There are some ways which can help us to fight with those problems. To begin with, people should train their eyes every day, exercise will not take more than 5 minutes. Moreover, the new function can be included in the phones - it will <<turn off them**T10**Abs_comp_clause**None**8**turn off>> for several minutes, if <<they were**T11**Ref_device**None**6**it was>> used more than 45 minutes (to give your eyes a rest). Also, for your back, your phone or computer can remind you to sit right or to go for a walk, do some exercises. To increase real communication more events should be held in schools, universities, at work.
To sum up, we can't <<stop people using**T5**Verb_pattern**None**22**stop people from using>> technologies - it is a very important part of our lives. However, we can reduce the influence of them and give a piece of advice how to cope with problems.
