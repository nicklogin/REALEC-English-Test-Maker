The last decades show us that more and more sportsmen use prohibited drugs to achieve better scores. What should the punishment look like: shold the sportsmen be banned from participation for a specific amount of time or even forgood?
To begin with, some sportsmen use drugs for medical purposes such as meldonium in Sharapova's case, so the athletes could use it to prevent professional illnesses and that would be fair to expell them from competition just for a limited amount of time. Besides, they get high scores and such medical prescriptions will serve its best, and the experts are aware of the health issues.
On the other hand, sports is meant only for healthy, strong and professional people, and there is no place for illegal drugs at such competitions like Olympic Games. As the problem of using drugs is spreading, people believe that banning sportsmen for the rest of their life is the best option.
In addition, there were a plenty of researches proving that using drugs hurts the athelets' health ten-fold times more. Unfortunately, sometimes it is almost impossible to find out if the athelet was on drugs as the government hides the results of the medical expertize.
In my opinion, the athelets who use drugs should be banned from competition forgood as they break the law and act unfair making "clean" sportsmen suffer. The main reason for such descision is to make law valuable, so there is no second chances for such cheaters.
In conclusion, with banning athelets who break the law should be banned. That will make the competition fair.
