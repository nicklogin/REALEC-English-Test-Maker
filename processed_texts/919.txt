In reacent time a lot of people claims that modern technology is a curse that leads to a health problems. It is no use to argue with this statement.
For begining,  many doctors already said, that such things like computers can caus a lot of prolems with heath. So, one of the most famous illness is damaged eyes. Then kids or adults spend a load of time next to monitor they starting to lose eyes sharphes. What is more, some scientiest claiws that some deuices cau lead euen cancer. There is no uniqe poiut betwine doctors, any way there is such kind of danger.
As for my, I find this problems not so unreducable. In general, all health desiases caused by modern techuologies were caused by ouer-use of this technologies and useing it in anpropriate way. So, if people start to control time that they spend with there deuices it will help to recduce a lot of problems with eyes. As a next step, we should understand that lightning aroun us is also very important. That means, that modern technologies haue some bad influens on people, but we can also dicrease that bad effect.
To sum up, wiede use of modern technology shown us that there are not only benefits in deuelopmeut of deuices, but also the great danger. But corect use of it can reduce to the minimum all harmful effects
