There is an opinion, that by giving longer sentences to <<convicts**T34**lex_item_choice**None**13**judged people>> it is possible to reduce <<crime**T33**Articles**None**18**the level of crime>>. However, it may be not the only way to do <<that but, apparently,**T35**Punctuation**None**21**that, but apparently,>> not the merciest one. It is also known that some people, who <<go to**T38**lex_item_choice**None**6**get in>> <<in prison**T36**Articles**None**10**the prison>> in <<young age**T37**Articles**None**11**a young age>>, <<are more likely to get**T16**Tense_choice**None**20**more likely will get>> there again. That is why the level of crime is <<high**T42**lex_item_choice**None**9**enourmous>> in such areas where there are <<many**T43**Comparative_adv**None**4**more>> <<people**T41**Punctuation**None**7**people,>> who have been in <<jail**T8**Articles**None**6**a jail>>.
On the one hand, it is l<<logical that**T25**Punctuation**None**13**logical, that>>longer sentences may stop people from d<<committing**T7**lex_item_choice**None**5**doing>>crime. Apparently, when someone knows that by stealing something he will only be put in a<<jail**T5**Articles**None**6**a jail>>for several m<<months,**T16**Punctuation**None**6**months>>it may be not as effective as if someone knows that he will be there for several years. Still, as far as I understand it, any person who decides to d<<commit**T2**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>>a crime, does not b<<really believe**T3**Standard**None**14**believe really>>that he will be captured.
On the other hand, I believe that people will more li<<likely to**T26**Prepositions**None**6**likely>>ever do<<commit**T4**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> crime if they are not pushed to it by the environment and society around them. If there is a ki<<kid who grows up in a criminal area or even in criminal family**T23**Punctuation**None**62**kid, who grows up in criminal area or even in criminal family,>>ometimes, even not wanting to do so, he has no other wa<<way**T9**Noun_number**None**4**ways>>o survive th<<there but**T16**Linking_device**None**11**there, than>>o<<to commit**T16**Infinitive_constr**None**5**doing>> crime. Moreover, by pu<<putting**T10**Derivation**None**6**puting>>his kid in a <<jail**T11**Articles**None**6**a jail>>nd not giving him help th<<to socialise and find a normal job and people to interact with there and thereafter**T22**Standard**None**83**there and thereafter to socialise and find a normal job and people to interact with>>will most likely make him a life-long prisoner. Of course, if the sentences wi<<were**T17**Conditionals**None**4**will>>e longer, it wi<<would**T18**Conditionals**None**4**will>>e even harder to ma<<stay**T19**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> normal and socialised person ou<<after them**T20**lex_item_choice**None**10**out of him>>In the conclusion, I would like to say that I believe there are a lot of alternative ways to reduce the crime level, such as rising the education level and providing psychological support for anyone, especially for those, who live in the<<cities**T13**Articles**None**10**the cities>>d areas with a high level of crime and drug-addiction. The<<There seems to be more ways**T16**Absence_comp_sent**None**26**These ways seem to be more>>d, moreover, wil<<these ways will help**T16**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**will help>>ose people to fully become a part of the society we live in.
