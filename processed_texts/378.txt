Nowadays the rate of the young committing crimes <<has become**T1**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> a big issue that should be discussed and solved.
In my opinion, there can be a lot of reasons for s<<such a growth**T6**Articles**None**11**such growth>>of the problem. First of all, in our busy world many parents sometimes tend to pay not as much attention to the nursery of their children as parents did before. The ideas of goodness, correct behavior a<<etc**T290**Redundant_comp**None**7**and etc>>are often not explained to children well enough. Beside that, s<<the social media propaganda**T291**Articles**None**23**social media propaganda>>of different cruel or dangerous things being “cool” or “fun” also plays i<<its**T2**Spelling**None**4**it’s>>role. Young people very often cannot separate information o<<into**T292**Prepositions**None**2**on>>t<<that**T3**Ref_device**None**7**the one>>you should trust, and t<<that**T4**Ref_device**None**7**the one>>you should not. Also, supposedly, it could be because of the higher amount of stress which p<<people of all age categories receive nowadays**T294**Standard**None**45**people receive nowadays of all age categories>> or the e<<thirst of adrenalin of the young**T296**Standard**None**33**thirst of the young for adrenalin>>
What society really can do to he<<solve**T297**lex_item_choice**None**4**help>>he problem is to promote correct values and inform people of what happens when you commit a crime. Parents and teachers should make sure that their kids and st<<students**T5**Noun_number**None**7**student>>re aware of the consequences, and should explain why it is so important to follow the rules and the law, and show good examples themselves. I believe that when given the right knowledge young people cannot grow up into criminals.

Children are our future and their education in all spheres of life is very important for all of us, so we should definitely work hard to help each of them to become the best huma<<human beings**T298**Often_confused**None**6**humans>>y can be.
