The issue of pirate copies has grown in importance over the past few years. It is widely assumed that users have an <<obligation**T1**Category_confusion**None**10**obligatory>> to buy music and films to enjoy. From my point of view, that kind of facilities <<has**T2**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> to be free for everyone, so #DELETE#4#that I <<absolutely**T3**Spelling**None**11**absoulutely>> disagree with this statement.
To begin with, musicians and producers offer their creativity for rather <<high**T309**lex_item_choice**None**9**expensive>> price. In this case fans would rather <<search for**T15**Modals**None**9**searching>> illegal pirate copies to listen to the music or to watch the film. They may browse the site which they do not know who created by, and watch <<the adorable movie**T7**Articles**None**14**adorable movie>> or <<listen to the song**T8**Absence_explanation**None**4**song>>. It does not mean that the fan is a thief and the fan can not imagine that may <<be punished**T9**Voice**None**9**be punish>>.
Moreover, people who make music and films have an opportunity to organize concerts and meetings. As a rule, tickets are extremely expensive. People who are addicted to their <<artwork**T316**lex_item_choice**None**10**creativity>> but do not have enough money to buy the ticket for the entry would like to download <<the track**T318**Articles**None**5**track>> surfing the Internet <<, so**T10**Punctuation**None**2**so>> creators must <<make**T11**Often_confused**None**2**do>> their work available for everyone not to lose fans. <<Now it is really common that**T15**Absence_comp_sent**None**24**Now it is really common,>> stars make something just for money and all works are similar and do not have any individuality. <<So why should people waste money for downloading anything that have no differences?**T12**Interrogative**None**82**So why people should waste money for downloading anything that has no differences?>> The <<fans**T325**Capitalisation**None**4**Fans>> do not have to be punished for their crazy love.
To conclude, punishment for <<downloading**T327**Articles**None**15**the downloading>> is not effective. People always find <<an alternative way**T14**Articles**None**15**alternative way>> to avoid payment. So, creators should make their <<artwork**T329**lex_item_choice**None**10**creativity>> available for fans <<on**T15**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the World Wide Web.
