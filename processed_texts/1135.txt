People<< who produce music and films**T1**Defining**None**29**, who produce music and films>> <<nowadays lose**T2**Standard**None**13**lose nowadays>> a lot of money<< because**T3**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> of people<< who do not buy the original legal copies of discs**T4**Defining**None**52**, who do not buy the original legal copies of discs,>> but download <<them**T5**Ref_device**None**2**it>> from illegal internet web-sites. It is a theft or not? <<I think that**T6**Punctuation**None**13**I think, that>> it is not always right.

<<From one point of view,**T7**Punctuation**None**22**From one point of view>> it <<would be**T10**Tense_choice**None**7**will be>> too <<exspensive**T9**Spelling**None**8**expensiv>> to buy always the original discs. Not all of us have <<enough**T11**Spelling**None**5**enogh>> money for it. <<For example,**T12**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> my friends <<cannot**T13**Spelling**None**7**can not>> pay 300 or more rubles for each film<< that**T14**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they want to watch. Sometimes we need it not only for fun, but <<, for instance,**T15**Punctuation**None**12**for instance>> for our <<study**T16**Spelling**None**5**stady>>. <<As a result,**T17**Punctuation**None**11**As a result>> people<< who cannot pay**T18**Defining**None**17**, who cannot pay,>> use the Internet and download <<everything**T21**lex_item_choice**None**3**all>> #DELETE#5#which they need for free, but I <<do not**T22**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> think<< that**T23**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they should be punished for it.

From the other point of <<view**T24**Spelling**None**4**viwe>>, it is imposible to <<produce**T25**Spelling**None**7**produse>> something<< when**T26**Punctuation**None**6**, when>> you do not <<get**T27**lex_item_choice**None**6**become>> money for it. A lot of producers use money<< that**T28**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they <<earn**T29**lex_item_choice**None**6**become>> from one film or music disc <<to produce**T30**Prepositions**None**14**for produce of>> something new. I think<< that**T32**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> when you <<really**T33**Spelling**None**5**realy>> like something, you should support people<< who have made it**T34**Defining**None**18**, who have made it>>. For example, I buy discs of my <<favorite**T36**Spelling**None**7**favorit>> music groups<< because**T37**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> I want to help them <<to get**T38**lex_item_choice**None**6**become>> some money for their work. <<I am**T39**Inappropriate_register**None**3**I’m>> sure<< that**T40**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they <<really**T41**Spelling**None**5**realy>> need it and, <<when I have responsibility to do something for them,**T43**Punctuation**None**53**when I have a responsibility to do something for them>> I will do it.

<<In conclusion,**T44**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I will say<< that**T45**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> everybody must choose <<themselves**T46**Inappropriate_register**None**7**himself>> to pay or not to pay for music and films. I decided to support film and music makers.
