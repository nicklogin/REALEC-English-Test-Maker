The <<percentage**T2**Spelling**None**10**persentage>> of crimes committed by the young is constantly growing and now crimes are <<committed**T3**Spelling**None**8**commited>> by young people <<more frequently**T4**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**more>> than before. There are some causes of this situation. In this essay I will provide the causes of this <<development**T7**Spelling**None**12**developement>> and suggest my solutions.
Firstly, the main cause of the growing level of crimes committed by young people nowadays is the lack of w<<workplaces**T8**Compound_word**None**11**work places>> Young people graduate from university and start searching for job, while they realise that there is no w<<workplaces**T9**Compound_word**None**11**work places>>for them. This may trigger some criminal events, such as gambling for getting money, working illegaly and even c<<committing**T10**Tense_form**None**9**commiting>>crimes just to survive. I think possible solution for this problem may be for the goverment to create more w<<workplaces**T11**Compound_word**None**11**work places>> Hovewer, this may cost a lot of money and take a lot of time. Another solution may be for the goverment to start a program that will help young people to find a job after the graduation without having a<<real work experience**T6**Countable_uncountable**None**22**a real work experience>> With the help of this program, the level of crimes will drop.
Secondly, it is clear that a lot of crimes committed by young adults may be caused by alcohol, especially the ones that co<<are committed**T5**Voice**None**8**commited>>hile driving a car. Crimes committed after drinking ar<<happen often**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**19**are happening often>>nd they are a real problem nowadays. The solution for this problem may be restricting driving the car in<<under influence**T15**lex_item_choice**None**20**in unsober condition>>This can prevent a lot of crimes and fa<<fatalities**T16**Spelling**None**9**fatalties>>n the ro<<road;**T17**Punctuation**None**5**road,>>owever, it will require more policemen and it is hard to put into work. Another solution for this problem may be for the goverment to restrict the sales of al<<alcohol;**T18**Punctuation**None**8**alcohol,>>or example, sale it to people who are older than 21 instead of 18, or sale it only from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m..
To conclude, the level of crimes that are being com<<committed**T6**Spelling**None**8**comitted>> young people is really high nowadays, and this problem remains unsolved. In my point of view, this problem needs to be tackled as soon as possible.
