The problem of <<an illegal distribution**T1**Articles**None**20**illegal distribution>> of intellectual property is nowadays very <<urgent**T2**lex_item_choice**None**5**sharp>>. Some people even <<think**T4**Punctuation**None**6**think,>> that not only distributors, but also consumers of illegal or “pirate” content should be punished. Of course, it’s <<a very difficult problem**T5**Articles**None**22**very difficult problem>> and <<we can hardly completely solve it**T7**Standard**None**33**we can hardly solve it completely>>. However, <<i**T8**Pronouns**None**3**I’m>> agree with only one part of this statement. It is <<true**T9**Punctuation**None**5**true,>> that we should punish <<people who illegally copy and share films or music**T10**Defining**None**51**people, who illegally copy and share films or music>>, because it is <<a property**T11**Articles**None**8**property>> and property rights should be protected strictly. However, sometimes a producer of some content leaves it in open access and anyone can download or share it. Consequently, sharing and copying it will not be illegal.
Moreover, another question arises – should we blame or punish consumers of “pirate” content? Should we blame <<peasants who got food from Robin Hood**T15**Defining**None**38**peasants, who got food from Robin Hood>>? They didn’t steal anything and they had no aim to violate <<laws**T16**Articles**None**8**the laws>>. In addition, practically all modern scientific theories are based on “rationality” of an individual #DELETE#6#person. Therefore, if <<he or she**T19**Absence_explanation**None**2**he>> <<downloads**T18**Spelling**None**9**dounloads>> <<a file**T12**Articles**None**4**file>> <<or**T21**Spelling**None**2**of>> <<anything else, which is in open access on the internet,**T23**Non_defining**None**54**anything else, which is in open access on the internet>> for free instead of buying it for some amount of money (<<modern**T24**Capitalisation**None**6**Modern>> films’ and music album’s cost is rather high, that is another reason why people <<download**T13**Spelling**None**8**dounload>> “pirate” content), should we blame him for <<rationality?**T20**Punctuation**None**12**rationality.>>
All in all, the problem of illegal copying and sharing is a lot more complex than some people think. <<Undoubtedly**T25**Linking_device**None**8**No doubt>>, <<people who violate laws and distribute illegal content**T26**Defining**None**55**people, who violate laws and distribute illegal content>> should be punished. Anyhow, punishing <<people who use this content**T28**Defining**None**28**people, who use this content>> would be cruel and unfair.
