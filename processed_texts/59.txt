In <<the 21st century**T1**Articles**None**12**21st century>> the science <<went**T3**Tense_choice**None**2**go>> forward. <<The Internet**T4**Articles**None**8**Internet>>, social media, social networks #DELETE#13#are important are <<an important part**T6**Articles**None**14**important part>> of human life. With <<a help**T7**Articles**None**4**help>> of them people <<can**T8**Tense_choice**None**5**could>> communicate<<,**T9**Punctuation**None**1**.>> <<watch**T10**Capitalisation**None**5**Watch>> news and videos. Improvements of hi-teck <<have**T11**Tense_choice**None**3**has>> not <<only**T12**lex_item_choice**None**3**all>> positive, but also negative sides. With <<a help**T13**Articles**None**4**help>> of social networks and <<websites**T14**Spelling**None**9**web-sites>> people all around the world <<can**T15**Tense_choice**None**5**could>> copy films and music and <<use**T17**lex_item_choice**None**13**watch or hear>> <<them**T18**Agreement_errors**None**2**it>> <<illegally**T16**Category_confusion**None**7**illegal>>.
There are two main <<points of view on this issue**T19**Absence_explanation**None**14**points of view>>. The first is supported by musicians, actors and producers, <<who**T20**Conjunctions**None**5**which>> <<lose**T21**Spelling**None**5**loose>> money from piracy in <<the internet**T22**Articles**None**8**internet>>. They spend money <<on**T23**Prepositions**None**3**for>> creating films and music <<, and**T24**Punctuation**None**3**and>> they want to earn more. There were many situations, when pirates <<uploaded**T26**lex_item_choice**None**10**downloaded>> films <<to**T25**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the internet**T27**Articles**None**8**internet>> before the <<premiere**T28**Spelling**None**7**premier>> <<, and**T29**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<film makers**T49**Spelling**None**11**film-makers>> lost some money <<, because**T30**Punctuation**None**7**because>> people watched it <<on**T31**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the internet**T32**Articles**None**8**internet>>. Some pirates created online cinemas, where people <<can**T33**Tense_choice**None**5**could>> <<watch**T34**lex_item_choice**None**3**see>> films <<for free**T35**Prepositions**None**4**free>>. Pirates earned money from advertising.  <<Film makers**T48**Spelling**None**11**Film-makers>> #DELETE#11#and lingers think<< that**T37**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> the government <<should**T38**Spelling**None**7**schould>> control the internet and protect property rights of people, who create films and music.
There is also <<an opposite point of view**T39**Articles**None**22**opposite point of view>>, which is supported by some internet-users and politicians in western countries. They think<< that**T40**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> government or police <<shouldn't**T41**lex_item_choice**None**8**couldn’t>> affect #DELETE#2#on <<the internet**T43**Articles**None**8**internet>>, because it is <<a free private space**T44**Articles**None**22**free and private space>> for people #DELETE#3#all <<around**T45**lex_item_choice**None**7**changed>> the world. Film makers and producers want to earn more money, but people mustn’t pay for their mistakes. Also internet-activists think<< that**T50**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> some producers <<simply are greedy**T51**Standard**None**17**are simply greedy>> and because of that they <<want to destroy**T52**Verb_Inf**None**12**want destroy>> the rules of global network. In many <<European**T53**Spelling**None**8**european>> <<countries:**T54**Punctuation**None**9**countries>> <<Iceland**T55**Spelling**None**8**Ycealand>>, Poland, Germany, Sweden, Finland and <<others,**T82**Punctuation**None**6**others>> <<were created**T58**Voice**None**7**created>> <<pirate parties**T59**Spelling**None**14**pirate-parties>>. These <<anti-systemic**T82**Spelling**None**11**anti-sistem>> movements protest against #DELETE#13#the rights of capitalism and global market. Activists from these parties <<support**T63**Tense_choice**None**9**supported>> internet users and <<think**T64**Tense_choice**None**7**thought>> that #DELETE#3#all people all around the world have the right to <<do**T66**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> in internet everything<< that**T67**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they want. Some of these parties won parlament seats in Europe.
To conclude, <<I'd**T68**Spelling**None**4**I’ed>> like to say<< that**T69**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> producers or <<film creators**T70**Spelling**None**13**film-creators>> and internet users must <<make**T71**lex_item_choice**None**6**create>> an agreement<< that**T72**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> would not only protect their property rights, but also will be comfortable for internet users. If creators <<upload**T74**Tense_choice**None**13**will download>> their intellectual property <<to**T75**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the internet**T77**Articles**None**8**internet>> and users <<pay**T78**Tense_choice**None**8**will pay>> not so much money for it, it would be practically comfortable not only for singers and film-creators, but also for internet-users. Of course, it is not easy to <<reach a compromise**T79**Articles**None**20**reach the compromise>> between these communities, but if they <<want**T80**lex_item_choice**None**10**would like>> to <<conduct negotiations**T81**lex_item_choice**None**18**fiant negotiations>>, it will be useful for all people – for creators and for users.
