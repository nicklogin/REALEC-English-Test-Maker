The pie charts show the <<percentage**T10**Word_choice**None**6**amount>> of goods transported by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. #DELETE#37#The information is given in percents.
It can be seen that <<the**T1**Spelling**None**2**he>> biggest part of railway transportation was <<taken up**T12**Prepositional_verb**None**5**taken>> by metals with 35% <<, while**T13**Punctuation**None**5**while>> the second chart shows <<food production**T14**Articles**None**19**the food production>> was the biggest part and <<accounted**T15**Tense_choice**None**8**accounts>> for 30%. The most distinguishing feature of the first chart is that there <<was**T16**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> three times as <<high**T17**Comparative_constr**None**4**many>> <<transportation of**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**metals>> as in the second chart.
A different pattern is that there <<was**T21**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**4**were>> approximately 3 times <<as high**T19**Comparative_constr**Dependent_change**4**more>> <<the percentage of food products**T20**Absence_explanation**Dependent_change**13**food products>> transported by road than by rail. <<As for machinery goods,**T3**Punctuation**None**22**As for machinery goods>> there <<was**T9**Agreement_errors**None**4**were>> about 5 times <<as large**T22**Comparative_constr**None**4**more>> <<portion of machinery**T23**Quantifiers**None**9**machinery>> transported by rail in comparison to road transportation with 12% in <<the former**T24**Articles**None**6**former>> and 2% in the latter chart.
The overall view of the charts shows that metals and and machinery <<were preferably**T8**Word_choice**None**14**prefered to be>> transported by rail while food products were transported by road. There <<was**T7**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**4**were>> also half <<the level of**T5**Comparative_constr**Dependent_change**7**as many>> non-metallic goods transported by rail as <<that transported by road**T25**Ref_device**None**7**by road>>. The other differences between charts <<are**T6**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> negligible.
