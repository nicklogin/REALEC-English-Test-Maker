In many countries of our <<modern**T1**Spelling**None**6**morden>> world there is a <<tendency for small businesses to be replaced**T20**Confusion_of_structures**None**38**tendency of replacing small businesses>> <<with**T19**Prepositions**None**2**by>> <<brands spread all over the world**T8**Word_choice**None**18**worldspread brands>>. Although there are drawbacks to such <<trends**T18**lex_item_choice**None**7**actions>>, I would argue that these are outweighed by the benefits. (hdsfvu)
