In modern society every sphere of life tends to be enhanced by modern technology. Sport area is not the exeption. A problem of drug consumption is harsh and some people suppose that athlets that were suspected in taking pills should not be allowed to participate in sport competitions at all, while others want them to be banned for a limited period of time.
Temporary prohibition to sportsmen from participating in competitions demonstrated humanity and respect to people, who are under drastic pressure and want to be a winner no matter what, hence they want to increase their chances. Athlets could also been given pills by their coaches and even government officialls so they agreed to take them against their will. Temporary ban may improve this situation, because athlets don't want to lose precious time.
Ban for the rest of live is the strictest form of punishment and may be the only solution to solve drug problem since the sportsman will have no choice. Career is believed to be so much worth than undoubtably perfect result. Such a measure will definitely restore faith of the society in the honesty and transparency of sport competitions, especially the Olympics; which was widely disregarded after the series of scandals involving drug usage by whole teams at particular kind of sport. Although it may not be fair - humanism states that people should be given second chances.
In my opinion, the duration of such a ban should be connected with the motives of sportsmen. If the athlet took a drug only one out of the team, he or she should be given limited prohibition due to his or her right to be treated as a human, who is allowed to make one mistake. When the drug case is against several athlets of particular team of the one country - they have to be banned for life since that is nothing, that state - sponsored dopping compaign. Incidents with common dopping should be punished heavily due to make spot fair and transparent again.
