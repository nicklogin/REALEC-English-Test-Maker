We can consider two <<purposes**T1**lex_item_choice**None**4**path>> of <<technologies**T2**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>.

And this second type <<is about**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**about>> entertainment. <<For example,**T10**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> people <<have**T11**Spelling**None**3**het>> problems with <<their**T12**Ref_device**None**5**these>> eyes, hands, legs and big  weight from <<the wrong style of life**T13**Articles**None**19**wrong style of life>> and being in <<a sitting pose**T14**Articles**None**12**sitting pose>> more than <<75% of**T15**Prepositions**None**3**75%>> <<everyday**T16**Spelling**None**9**every day>> routine.

We know about ancient culture where <<there was no technology**T21**Negation**None**22**was not any technology>>, where lived <<the great philisophers**T22**Articles**None**18**great philosophers>> who knew about space and planets <<before**T23**lex_item_choice**None**6**unless>> modern techs.
