To begin with, there are approximetely the same p<<percentage**T10**Spelling**None**10**persantage>>of transporting manufactured goods by rail and by road (it is 25 percent and 28 percent). However, there are different levels of metals,<< which are transported**T11**Punctuation**None**23**, which are transported>> For example, by rail is 35 percent, but by road is 11 percent. Also, approximately the same d<<difference**T16**Noun_number**None**11**differentes>>are between food products: 11 percent of this sort of goods are transported by rail and 30 percent - by road.
Then, 12 percent of machinery are transported by rail, but only 2 percent of machinery are transported by road.As for non-metalic minerals and chemicals, we can see that this goods are transported mostly by road (16 percent and 13 percent vs. 11 percent and approximately 6 percent).
In conclusion, this two pie charts sho<<show**T14**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**shows>> real information about transportation between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008 yea#DELETE#4#r.
