Some people believe that the modern tendency for exploring space is useless and cannot help our society. There are more urgent problems <<, that cannot be ignored,**T2**Non_defining**None**22**that cannot be ignored>> such as poverty and environmental issues. I do not agree with this opinion.

The main point is that it does not mean there are enough money for these problems. However, space exploring is too important sphere to be taken money from and people can work out other ways to solve them: to decrease sallaries of politicians, for example.
