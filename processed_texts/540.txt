There is a fact that people prefer watching British films or American films <<to**T359**Prepositions**None**9**more than>> watching films #DELETE#5#which produced by local film industries.
Let i<<us**T1**Spelling**None**2**is>>begin with the reasons for this. On the one hand, British and American film industries are more popular because of the f<<financial support which the government gives them**T2**Defining**None**50**financial support, which the government gives them>> A<<As we can see,**T363**Punctuation**None**13**As we can see>>if f<<a film**T365**Articles**None**4**film>>has the best actors and good equipment, it means that f<<the film**T3**Articles**None**4**film>>has a good financial support. For example, if film i<<industry**T368**Noun_number**Dependent_change**10**industries>>w<<wants**T370**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**4**want>>to see popular actors playing in their films, actors should have a good salary for this job. Moreover, if they want to have a good camera or p<<place where the film will be filmed**T386**Absence_comp_sent**None**29**place, where the film will be>> they also should have a<<money**T372**Articles**None**7**a money>>to rent it.
On the other hand, many people all over the world like superheroes or st<<stories which are closer to their interests or unreal lifes**T6**Defining**None**60**stories, which are closer to their interests or unreal lifes>>People want to watch movies, << in which they can take part**T375**Defining**None**30**, in which they can take part,>>here they can be every character they want.

Wa<<Watching these films,**T382**Punctuation**None**20**Watching these films>>e can go away from the real life. So, fi<<film industries which have a good financial support**T11**Defining**None**52**film industries, which have a good financial support>>ave a chance to help us to solve our problems, whereas local film industries cannot. They can only tell us st<<stories which are closer to our real lifes**T12**Defining**None**42**stories, which are close to our real lifes>>To sum up, I want to say that it <<it is important for film industries to have a good finances**T14**Absence_comp_sent**None**60**it is important for film industries have good fundingfunding>> produce their films.
