The 2 <<piecharts given**T1**Standard**None**15**given piecharts>> illustrate the percentage of transported goods of different types by road and by rail. Overall, it can be seen<< that the share of manufactured goods, that are delivered both by trains and by trucks, is practically the same**T2**Punctuation**None**112**, that the share of manufactured goods, that are delivered both by trains and by trucks, is practically the same>>.
However, there is a certain difference between the amount of the <<production**T3**Category_confusion**None**11**producement>> shipped by the 2 means of transport. For instance, metals <<make**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**contain>> more than a third in <<the**T5**Articles**None**1**a>> whole delivered goods by rail, whereas <<its**T6**Pronouns**None**4**it's>> share in road transportation is thrice less. To continue with, the pattern is reversed for the delivery of food by these 2 means of transport. For example, the amount of grocery, transported by the road, <<is thrice as high as transported by rail**T7**Punctuation**None**41**is thrice as high, as transported by rail>>. One more noticable feature of these diagrams is that the share of chemicals<<, shipped by both means of transport,**T8**Punctuation**None**36**, shipped by both means of transport>> varies from 10 to 20 per cent.
On the whole, the lowest share of both graphs belongs to the transportation of machinery by the railroad, containing only 2%.
