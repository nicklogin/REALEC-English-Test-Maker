The chart depicts the development of the book market in four countries, comparing consumption of eBooks and printed books. It can be stated that in the English-speaking countries the sales of the printed books are going to be seriously reduced in comparison to eBooks in 2018.
Sales of the printed books are expected to be fallen dramatically (almost 30%). At the same time eBooks will expectedly start gaining popularity earning 3 billion Dollars more than in 2014. Changes in UK are not expected to be as serious, with consumption of printed books shortened only by the fifth and consumption of eBooks gaining just 0,5 billion USD, but eBooks are still expected to prevail in 2018.
The other two countries are reported to remain more conservative, showing no real growth of interest in eBooks whatsoever. In China the consuption of printed books is expected to be reduced only for 0,6 billion USD and in Germany there are no changes expected at all. The eBooks are expected to earn 0,5 billion USD more in both countries.
The chart leads to conclusion that eBooks are more acceptable for the English speaking countries, which may be explained by the fact, that almost all of the stores sell eBooks in English.
