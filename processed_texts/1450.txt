Nowadays people <<eat**T1**Spelling**None**4**ears>> <<a large amount**T2**Articles**None**12**large amount>> of food everyday. #DELETE#8#Kinds of <<The food**T4**Articles**Dependent_change**4**food>> in different countries <<is**T5**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**are>> different and <<has**T6**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**4**have>> <<it's own**T7**Absence_explanation**None**3**own>> degrees of ability. <<Some people think that**T9**Punctuation**None**23**Some people think, that>> the food <<produced**T11**Voice**None**9**producing>> in any #DELETE#5#thing country <<is needed by**T13**Prepositions**None**12**is needed to>> it’s population only and <<imported**T14**Spelling**None**6**omport>> food must <<should get**T15**lex_item_choice**None**4**gets>> as little attention as possible. In this article I try to discuss this problem from every <<side**T16**Noun_number**None**5**sides>> and give <<arguments**T17**Noun_number**None**8**argument>> for my opinion.

First, there are many countries <<that have**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**have>> <<a small part**T19**Articles**None**9**small par>>t of <<world's resources**T20**Spelling**None**16**worlds resourses>> and food <<grounds**T21**Noun_number**None**6**ground>> for <<the selection**T22**Articles**None**9**selection>> of different cultures, vegetables and fruits. They <<cannot**T23**Spelling**None**7**can not>> produce enough food <<for their own**T24**Prepositions**None**12**to their own>> population, but they have <<other**T25**Often_confused**None**7**another>> <<resources that they can sell**T26**Punctuation**None**29**resources, that they can sell>> on the world market and for <<the money**T28**Articles**None**9**his money>> <<to be able**T29**Confusion_of_structures**None**9**have able>> to buy the <<food**T30**Noun_number**None**5**foods>>. In our days it is <<a very popular problem**T31**Articles**None**20**very popular problem>> of <<Africa's**T32**Spelling**None**8**Afroca’s>> republics and north countries, for example. 

Second, <<I think that**T33**Punctuation**None**13**I think, that>> <<people**T34**lex_item_choice**None**10**population>> <<do not**T35**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> want to <<eat**T36**Spelling**None**3**wat>> <<the same food**T38**Articles**None**9**same food>> every day, if it is greatest testy food in the world. People’s <<organisms**T39**Noun_number**Dependent_change**8**organism>> <<need**T40**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**needs>> to get <<bigger amount**T41**lex_item_choice**None**12**large number>> of health vitamins from different <<vegetables**T42**Spelling**None**10**vegotables>> and <<fruits that grow**T43**Punctuation**None**17**fruits, that grow>> in <<other**T45**Often_confused**None**7**another>> parts of the world. <<Of course,**T46**Punctuation**None**9**Of course>> <<someone**T47**lex_item_choice**None**8**somebody>> can fly <<for weekends**T48**Prepositions**None**11**to weekends>> to <<different**T49**lex_item_choice**None**7**another>> parts of the world, but many people <<do not have**T50**Negation**None**8**have not>> this ability. So it is very <<necessary to have**T51**Prepositions**None**14**necessary have>> <<an access**T60**Spelling**None**5**acses>> to <<imported**T54**Category_confusion**None**6**import>> food as #DELETE#7#soon as to <<it's own**T56**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**own>>.

<<In conclusion,**T57**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I would say that I disagree with this point, because <<everybody**T58**Spelling**None**8**verybody>> must have different <<kinds**T59**Noun_number**None**4**kind>> of food from different parts of the world. This food have <<it's own**T60**Absence_comp_colloc**None**3**own>> vitamins.
