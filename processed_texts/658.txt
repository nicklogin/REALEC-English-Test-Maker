Enviromental problems are becoming more and more visible every year.
It is not a secret that g<<government**T2**Spelling**None**9**governmet>>and also people t<<themselves**T3**Spelling**None**10**themselfes>>should at least try to solve these problems.
One of the biggest enviromental pr<<problems**T4**Noun_number**None**7**problem>>s ai<<the air pollution**T5**Articles**None**13**air pollution>>It is already proved that air travel plays an important role in polluting air<<the air**T7**Articles**None**3**air>>o many people believe, t<< that**T8**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>ducing the amount of air travel will help to make the air cleaner.
Unfo<<Unfortunately**T9**Spelling**None**13**Unfortunetely>>is question is very complicated; it does not seem possible to have this question answ<<answered**T10**Spelling**None**8**answerde>>ediately.
On te one hand, air pollution could be mortal to nature and, therefore, human as well, since it leads to global warming.
On the other hand, we should also pay attention to other factors, because air travel is not the only source that pollutes air and enviroment.
To my mind, air travel is overestimated. I shoul a<<should**T23**Spelling**None**5**shoul>> that << that**T24**Punctuation**None**6**, that>>very comfora<<comfortable**T21**Spelling**None**11**comforatble>><< since**T22**Punctuation**None**7**, since>>usually the fastes way to travel.
But in my opinion, there are lots of destinat<<destinations**T26**Noun_number**None**11**destination>>ld get to without ussing p<<using**T27**Spelling**None**6**ussing>>F<<a plane**T12**Articles**None**5**plane>>ample, a person, while traveling from Moscow to St. Petersburgh, could ude a tra<<use**T25**Spelling**None**3**ude>>or even a car.
Fossil fuels and gases provided by car lead to pollution as well, but compared to air pollution caused by air transport. it is less harmful.

Athough we should use alternative transport more often, the gouvernment <<government**T34**Spelling**None**11**gouvernment>>force us not to use air transport.
At least because there are many places that are impossible or simply veru hard to <<very**T35**Spelling**None**4**veru>>h without using a plain.
We shoul keep in <<should**T33**Spelling**None**5**shoul>> that air pollution is much more that air travell only.
<<travel**T32**Spelling**None**7**travell>>re so many factors, that create h<< that**T31**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> nature and enviroment.
As I've said earlier, car gases, even smoking and breathind produce carbon dioxide and, therefore, pollute air.
But the biggest harm is, of coarse, provided <<course**T30**Spelling**None**6**coarse>>tories, especially the ones that produce metal and energy( from oil for example).
The government has to try decreasing number of these kind of factories, or use alternati<< or**T20**Punctuation**None**4**, or>>ays of energy and working with metal.
Building nuclear power station instead of oil/gas power station could be very helpful, since it was many times Scientifically prov<<scientifically**T19**Capitalisation**None**14**Scientifically>>enviromentally friendly.
As a whole, it is important to keep in mind that solving this enviromenatal problem should be priority now, specially when we ta<<especially**T18**Often_confused**None**9**specially>>air pollution.

To conclude, we deffinately should use<<definitely**T15**Spelling**None**11**deffinately>>ort less, sinse it pollutes air <<since**T16**Spelling**None**5**sinse>>auses to huger enviromental pro<<more huge**T17**Suffix**None**5**huger>>.
