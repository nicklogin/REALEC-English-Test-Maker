There are two pie charts with the information about <<the transportation**T1**Articles**None**14**transportation>> of different goods between some countries in Eastern Europe. Goods are transported by rail and by road. 

It is obvious that metals <<are mostly transported**T2**Voice**None**18**mostly transported>> by rail: 35% in contrast <<to**T3**Prepositions**None**4**with>> only 11% by road. There is also a significant difference in <<the transportation of**T4**Category_confusion**None**12**transporting>> machinery (it is mostly transported by rail) and food products (in contrast <<they**T5**Ref_device**None**2**it>> <<are**T6**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> mostly transported by road). Talking about non-metallic minerals, chemicals and manufactured goods, they are transported in rather similar proportions either by rail or by road. 

To sum up, metals, machinery and manufactured goods are goods that are mostly transported by rail. 72% of all rail transportations consist from them together. And other 28% consist from chemicals, non-metallic minerals, and food products. Non-metallic minerals are the most unpopular goods to transport by rail. More <<than**T7**Often_confused**None**4**then>> <<half**T8**Articles**None**6**a half>> of transportations by road <<consist**T9**Agreement_errors**None**8**consists>> from food products and manufactured goods (58%). The most unpopular goods to transport by road are machinery.
