Nowadays British and American <<cinema industry**T45**Confusion_of_structures**None**18**industry of cinema>> prospers thanks to the high demand <<from**T10**Prepositions**None**2**of>> the <<consumers**T1**Spelling**None**9**comsumers>> #DELETE#4#from all over the world. Such companies as Hollywood, <<Warner**T35**Spelling**None**6**Worner>> Brothers or Pixar supply films which any locally produced films could hardly beat. It is <<thought**T37**lex_item_choice**None**8**supposed>> that spectators prefer American or British films because of the sufficient financial support given by their governments.
I strongly disagree with this p<<point**T2**Spelling**None**4**poin>>of view and I suppose that only true craftsmanship in cinematography a<<allows**T4**Spelling**None**7**allowes>>companies g<<listed**T38**lex_item_choice**None**5**given>>above to prosper w<<globally**T3**lex_item_choice**None**10**wordwidely>> First of all, it w<<is worth**T33**Tense_form**None**5**woths>>t<<mentioning**T39**Gerund_phrase**None**10**to mention>>that these companies started their work in 1930s w<<, when**T7**Non_defining**None**4**when>>they consisted of approximately five or six workers b#DELETE#3#ut t<<who**T8**Defining**None**4**they>>were skilled and had a great p<<passion for**T9**Prepositional_noun**None**10**passion in>>their work. Those were small initiatives which had g#DELETE#5#iven their results and only after their first successful films they had b<<started**T36**Word_choice**None**6**become>>to be sponsored. Secondly, I would like to say that c<<the cast**T11**Articles**None**4**cast>>and plot of these f<<films**T12**Noun_number**None**4**film>>produced by American and English companies m<<are mostly unprecedented**T15**Standard**None**24**mostly are unprecedented>>w<<, which**T14**Coordinate**None**4**what>>makes them t#DELETE#8#o be on the top of the cinema industry.
However, many people believe that many locally produced films deserve more fe<<promotion**T51**lex_item_choice**None**8**feedback>>han they ha<<get**T49**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>>n#DELETE#6#deed by<<for**T18**Prepositions**None**2**by>>he world audience. For instance, Italian cinema ha<<does not have**T19**Tense_form**None**7**has not>>o<<as**T41**Comparative_constr**None**2**so>>any fans as it could because of small scales it is re<<released in**T42**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**released>>n comparison to the American or British ones. Moreover, these locally produced films are considered to be masterpieces due to their ideas. Many produsers have a real talent for film creation but it may be hidden because people are mostly interested in popular thrillers or in movies with impressive special effects.
Against to #DELETE#2#the arguments given above I c<<, i**T28**Punctuation**None**1**I>>n give the examples of the films which were locally pro<<produced**T52**Spelling**None**8**prodused>>t have rec<<received**T24**Spelling**None**8**recieved>>e worldwide appreciation. Among them are such films as 'Stealing beauty', 'Miracles in Milan', 'Life is beautiful' by Italian pro<<producers**T21**Spelling**None**9**produsers>>hese fil<<films**T22**Noun_number**None**4**film>>ve captured the audience thanks to their deep thoughts and sen<<sense**T23**Spelling**None**5**sence>>thout any great financial expenditures.
Taking into consideration all I mentioned above I would like to say that a fi<<financial support**T44**Articles**None**19**a financial support>>not a ma<<the main**T27**Articles**None**6**a main>>son why American and British cinema indu<<industries**T26**Noun_number**None**8**industry>>e a su<<such popularity**T40**Articles**None**17**a such popularity>>ere are many other reasons but the main one is a go<<the good quality**T29**Articles**None**14**a good quality>>prod<<the produced film**T30**Articles**None**13**produced film>>s actors and deve#DELETE#9#loped plot with the idea wich make<<think**T33**Verb_object_bare**None**25**makes spectators to think>>r this film again and again...
