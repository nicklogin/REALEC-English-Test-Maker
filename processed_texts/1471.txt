Nowadays selling pirate music and <<films**T1**Noun_number**None**4**film>> is a profitable business. Producing compact discs and digital video disks brings criminal <<dealers**T2**Noun_number**None**6**dealer>> a lot of money.

<<Some**T3**lex_item_choice**None**5**Small>> <<wonder if**T4**Confusion_of_structures**None**11**wonder that>> <<the main issue**T5**Articles**None**6**a main>> issue of consumers #DELETE#11#the debate, is the offensive price set <<of compact discs**T7**Prepositions**None**16**on compact discs>>. Instead of spending nearly twenty dollars <<on a compact disc**T8**Prepositions**None**18**per a compact disc>>, consumers <<find**T10**Tense_choice**None**11**are finding>> it much << more**T11**Spelling**None**4**,ore>> reasonable to illegally download the songs they want. The risk is very minimal.

To my mind, selling pirate music and films is a kind of theft because people who sell them <<violate**T12**lex_item_choice**None**8**exercise>> one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder without autorization. <<The legal producers**T13**Articles**None**15**Legal producers>> of music and <<films**T14**Noun_number**None**4**film>> <<suffer because of**T15**Absence_explanation**None**6**suffer>> considerable losses. <<By buying**T16**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**Buying>> pirate production consumers support the seller’s unauthotization actions. What is more, the quality of these disks usually leaves much to be desired. <<So,**T17**Punctuation**None**2**So>> if you <<do not**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> want to waste your money and to lose your good spirits, <<you would**T19**Inappropriate_register**None**5**you’d>> better <<not to buy**T20**Infinitive_constr**None**7**not buy>> bad production. On the other hand, disks of <<a good quality**T21**Articles**None**12**good quality>> are usually rather expensive and not <<everyone**T22**lex_item_choice**None**9**everybody>> can afford to buy them. Besides, pirates sell the latest records and so we are able to watch new films or listen to new songs. That is why a lot of people continue buying pirate music and <<films**T23**Noun_number**None**4**film>>.

To conclude, I think it is better to go to the movies or to buy qualitative music and <<films**T24**Noun_number**None**6**film i>>f you want to enjoy good films or music. To add to it, bad music and <<films**T25**Noun_number**None**4**film>> will disappear and it will improve the country’s economy.
