Over the past few decades a lot of people <<have come to**T25**Tense_choice**None**4**have>> an opinion that morden <<technology**T26**Spelling**None**9**techology>> has bad influence on our health.
I am <<convinced**T4**Spelling**None**10**convienced>> that it can really be <<harmful to**T16**Prepositional_adjective**None**11**harmful for>> us for a few reasons. Firstly, with the development of computers and mobile phones we spend too much time using it. <<As a result,**T14**Punctuation**None**11**As a result>> many people have eye problems in our society. Secondly, today we have various new gadgets<< which**T12**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> help us to live or play in virtual world <<like that of**T17**Ref_device**None**4**like>> "VR" glasses or computer games. It has <<a bad influence**T22**Articles**None**13**bad influence>> on our <<physical**T10**Spelling**None**8**psyhical>> health.
However, other people suppose that <<modern**T9**Spelling**None**6**morden>> technology <<plays**T11**Agreement_errors**None**4**play>> an important role in the fight against health difficulties. For example, a lot of different inventions in <<medicines**T25**Noun_number**None**8**medecine>> against cancer have been developed over the past 2 decades. Also, new technology has <<influenced**T7**Transitive**None**13**influenced on>> sport industry. So, <<it**T8**Spelling**None**2**in>> decreases a number of ill people.
<<There**T13**Spelling**None**4**Ther>> are some ways in which we can reduce the problems linked with new technology. For example, we can develop new <<types**T6**Noun_number**None**4**type>> of screens for our mobiles, <<TVs**T24**Spelling**None**4**TV's>> and computers which would <<reduce harm to**T19**Word_choice**None**18**not be harmful for>> our <<eyes**T20**Spelling**None**3**yes>>. Another solution is to spend less time using <<gadgets**T21**Ref_device**None**2**it>>. The problem of virtual life can be <<eliminated**T28**Word_choice**None**7**reduced>> if we <<used**T29**Tense_form**None**9**would use>> it <<only in some particular spheres**T31**Word_choice**None**26**in some particular spheres>>, for instance, in aircraft education.
To sum up, I think that new technology has both advantages and disadvantages. So, our society has a task to <<search for**T2**Prepositional_verb**None**6**search>> the most beneficial <<way to use**T25**Noun_inf**None**10**way of use>> it.
