More and more people today say that <<the widespread use**T1**Absence_explanation**None**10**widespread>> of technology <<causes**T2**Tense_choice**None**10**is causing>> an increasing number of health problems. I, for one, agree with this statement. 

Today <<technologies**T3**Noun_number**Dependent_change**14**the technology>> <<have spreaded**T27**Tense_form**None**10**has spread>> so wide, we <<cannot**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**5**canâ€™t>> even live without <<them**T7**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**it>>. We <<always stare**T8**Tense_choice**None**18**are always staring>> <<at tiny screens**T9**Prepositions**None**15**on tiny screens>> of our phones, or <<at screens**T11**Prepositions**None**10**on screens>> of our computers. <<This constant**T12**Spelling**None**12**Thisconstant>> staring <<makes**T13**lex_item_choice**None**3**has>> our eyes being focused all the time and thus provokes all the eye problems one can <<imagine**T14**Spelling**None**6**imagin>>. The quality of our eyesight falls with every day, making us wear glasses. The other problem wich comes with the modern technology is caused by our personal computers. For example, I spend a lot of time sitting in my chair before my <<computer**T15**Spelling**None**9**computers>> screen playing games or doing my work. What is the problem here? Well, from sitting in one pose for such a long time I can get back pain, or even get a posture problem. <<In the worst case**T27**Articles**None**10**Worst case>> I might even <<get**T18**Tense_choice**None**3**got>> long-lasting problems with my spine.

But how can we solve these problems? First of all, everyone working with a computer, watching their TV or using their phone should <<do**T19**lex_item_choice**None**7**perform>> eye gymnastics <<regularly**T20**lex_item_choice**None**13**ever so often>>. Basically, you should focus your <<eyes**T21**lex_item_choice**None**4**sigt>> on something far and then spin your eyes for a bit. Secondly, if you are sitting for a long time you should stand up and do <<small workouts**T22**Articles**None**15**a small workout>> from time to time. This includes a bit of stretches, jumps and squats . On the greater scale of things, it would be great <<if**T25**Spelling**None**2**of>> everyone <<would have just started running**T26**Conditionals**None**20**just started running>> in the mornings. These runs would solve a lot of physical problems for a lot of people and make <<the health**T27**Articles**None**6**health>> of the nation much better as a whole.
