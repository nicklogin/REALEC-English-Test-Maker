Nowadays the problems of copying and sharing <<illegal pirate versions of music**T6**Articles**None**36**the illegal pirate versions of music>> <<on**T46**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the internet**T1**Articles**None**8**internet>> <<are**T5**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> really widespread. Many people<< who**T3**Defining**None**5**, who>> download <<these**T2**Spelling**None**5**thees>> files <<are punished**T4**Agreement_errors**None**11**is punished>>. I agree that this category of people should be <<arrested**T7**Spelling**None**7**arested>>.
First of all, people do this #DELETE#10#punishment without <<telling**T10**Dative**None**10**telling to>> <<the author**T44**Articles**None**5**autor>> of original music. <<Consequently**T11**lex_item_choice**None**6**Follow>>, the <<author**T12**Spelling**None**5**autor>> <<doesn’t know**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**doesn’t>> where his music is <<used**T48**lex_item_choice**None**7**located>>. <<Secondly,**T14**Punctuation**None**8**Secondly>> <<pirate copies**T15**Articles**None**17**The pirate copies>> <<can be used**T49**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**can used>> by people in many places <<like**T16**Spelling**None**5**likes>> <<restaurants**T17**Spelling**None**10**restorants>> and <<somebody**T18**Ref_device**None**5**other>> can <<pretend it is their own music**T50**Word_choice**None**25**think that it is original>>.
 On the other hand, copying and sharing music <<or**T20**Spelling**None**2**of>> films on the internet makes <<them**T21**Agreement_errors**None**2**it>> more popular and famous. Moreover, <<authors**T22**Spelling**None**6**autors>> of music and <<films**T23**Noun_number**None**4**film>> can <<become**T24**Tense_form**None**6**became>> really #DELETE#8#good and famous <<people**T25**Redundant_comp**None**6**person>>. 
<<To continue,**T27**Punctuation**None**35**To continue arguments of discussion>> there are many people<< who**T29**Defining**None**5**, who>> <<upload**T28**lex_item_choice**None**8**download>> pirate files <<after**T52**Prepositions**None**2**by>> buying the original discs. They spend money <<on**T30**Prepositions**None**3**for>> this and after that they <<share the content**T31**Category_confusion**None**10**do sharing>> for free. However, it <<cannot be compared with**T35**Modals**None**20**doesn’t compare with>> losing huge amounts of money every <<year**T37**Spelling**None**5**years>> by producers #DELETE#4#they. They lose money because pirate copies <<are sold**T44**Tense_form**None**9**is selled>> and people buy <<them**T36**Ref_device**None**2**it>>.
To conclude #DELETE#21#the argument of essay, people who <<download**T39**Spelling**None**7**donload>> pirate illegal files of <<music**T41**Spelling**None**6**musics>> and films #DELETE#4#etc, should be punished because these people do <<illegal**T43**lex_item_choice**None**5**unlaw>> things. Moreover, they ignore the law about intellectual <<property**T44**Spelling**None**7**promity>>.
