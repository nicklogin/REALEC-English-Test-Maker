Then it had slight fall to 60% in 2013, but after that Apple reached the peak which is more than 90%. 
This can not be said about other companies. Both blackberry’s and HTC’s share profits started to fall from nearly 20% in 2011 and stopped in 2015 at the equal percentage which is about only 5%. The only difference is that Blackberry hasn’t <<got**T2**Tense_form**None**6**gotten>> no improvements since 2010, and HTC’s share profits level has rosen a bit in 2011. 
Samsung’s level of share profits has climbed from around 15% in 2010 to slightly above 20% in 2013. However, it was its peak. Starting from <<2013,**T4**Punctuation**None**4**2013>> <<Samsung's**T5**Punctuation**None**8**Samsungs>> level has only been plunging till it reached its’ lowest result at the same percentage that Samsung had in 2010. 
All thing concluded, it is clearly that Apple is the absolute leader on the market.
