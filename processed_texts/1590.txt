<<A. Orlenko**T1**ADV**None**5**There>> is a common belief that fast technological development is one of the main causes of <<the rise**T296**Articles**None**4**rise>> of health problems nowadays. This essay will <<, firstly,**T297**Punctuation**None**8**firstly,>> outline one of those health problems and <<, secondly,**T298**Punctuation**None**9**secondly,>> suggest <<a possible solution for it**T299**Articles**None**17**possible solution>> for it.
The principal health problem, associated with widespread use of modern technology, is obesity. Today people are about to eat unhealthy food, full of genetic modifications, and also walk less due to transport development. This results in many people getting <<overweight**T300**Spelling**None**11**over weight>> and this problem affects the whole wellbeing of human organism. And <<according**T301**Capitalisation**None**9**According>> to some statistics, every third person in Russia suffers from obesity.

It is clear that there is no ability today to stop technological progress. Despite this fact, some changes in <<people's**T305**Possessive**None**7**peoples>> lifestyle can be easily implemented with the help of the government and some non-governmental organizations. These changes include mainly sports development, which primary means creation of new facilities for sports activities in both cities and countryside and engaging more people, especially young ones, in such activities. Russian government is already launching such programms and they do really work. For instance, the number of <<people who**T306**Defining**None**11**people, who>> do sports more than one time per week in our country rose by nearly 30% in last few years.
In conclusion, obesity is one of the main problems, connected with technological advancements, however, it can be reduced by popularization of sports activities. As special programms are already being made, <<people's**T307**Possessive**None**7**peoples>> health is estimated to improve over upcoming years.
