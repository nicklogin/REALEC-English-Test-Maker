The given line graphs <<represent**T2**Agreement_errors**None**10**represents>> the information about different levels of temperatures in two cities of Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro. In general, the temperature in the Russian city is more unstable than in Brazil. We can notice that <<in both cases**T3**Redundant**None**18**both in both cases>> maximum and minimum lines #DELETE#5#lines <<resemble**T5**Spelling**None**9**ressemble>> each other. It is clearly evident that in Rio de Janeiro the temperature touches the peak at 30 degrees during the winter and gets the lowest point in the summer at 25. However, the situation in Yakutsk differs greatly from the Brazilian city. For instance, the highest point of temperatures goes to summer months and the lowest ones touch its point in the winter. As for the average minimum temperatures in Brazil the situation remains the same with the peak in winter and the lowest point in summer but the <<numbers**T6**Spelling**None**6**numers>> are <<different**T7**Spelling**None**8**differnt>> - approximately 23 degrees as the higest point and around 17 in July. So, the same situation is in Russia. To sum up, the average temperatures in both cities differ from each other a lot.
