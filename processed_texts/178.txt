The bar chart depicts the percentage of unemployed people in several regions of the world in 2014 and 2015.
As can be seen from the graph, there is no striking difference in the unemployment rates between 2014 and 2015 in all selected regions. In two <<out of**T2**Prepositions**None**2**of>> six areas the rate remained exactly the same. It is N. Africa and S. Asia. Although in the rest <<of the regions**T1**Articles**None**7**regions>> the rates changed, the worldwide unemployment rate was still 5,9 percent in 2015.
Also it can be mentioned that the ranking of regions <<did not change**T3**Tense_choice**None**15**has not changed>> in 2015 because there were only slight <<volatilities**T4**lex_item_choice**None**11**hesitations>> of the rates. For example, in the EU the level increased only by 0.4 percent while in the Middle East and Latin America the percentage of unemployed people decreased by 1.4 and 1 percent <<respectively**T5**lex_item_choice**None**11**accordingly>>.
<<Overall**T1**Capitalisation**None**7**overall>>, it is evident that any conclusions about trend cannot be made as there is no definite pattern of changes in the unemployment rates.
