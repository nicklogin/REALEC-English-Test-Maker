Nowadays there is a crucial problem in musical and film making industries

Producers and musicians lose their money because their masterpieces are being stolen. It is a serious crime to illegally copy music and films and publish them on the Internet. Not only pirates should be punished, but also people who use these copies. I agree with this opinion and I will give my reasons why.

Firstly, every work should be paid. Producers, musicians spend a lot of money to make a product. It is just unfair when someone uses it for free. people should understand that films and music are the same goods as clothes, cars, houses. When you watch a film you must pay for entertainment. Morover, it can be hardly imagined how producers and musicians feel when their masterpieces become just pirate copies.

Secondly, it is always a pleasure to watch films and listen to the music in a good quality. When we buy something we can have unrestricted access to that. If we buy an album, we will listen to it for years. Furthermore, there won’t be any extra noise or bad quality songs.

Thirdly, we help producers and musicians to make their products better with buying music and films. They start trying do their work better for the audience.

However, there is an opposing opinion. Some Internet users think that unrestricted access to films and music make our life easier. We can get what we want in a minute. That is the typical hydonists’ point of view. But I think we should care not about only ourselves. You should give something for take.

To conclude, I do believe that making pirate copies an using the, is a real crime. People who use illegal copies of films and music should be punished. They need to understand that every work should be paid. Remembering this pivotal principe will make either producers and musicians’ or Internet users’ lives easier.
