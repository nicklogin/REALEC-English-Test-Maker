There are so huge <<amount**T1**Spelling**None**5**amont>> of money <<losses**T2**Spelling**None**5**loses>> every year from <<musicians**T3**Possessive**None**9**musicians>> and film <<producers**T4**Possessive**None**9**producers>> pockets. It is caused by illegal pirate copies. People who <<steal**T5**lex_item_choice**None**5**theft>> music or films from <<the Internet**T39**Articles**None**8**internet>>, from pirates resourses should be punished, instead <<a human**T8**Articles**None**5**human>><< who bougth the original version of entertainment**T9**Defining**None**50**, who bougth the original version of entertainment>>. Is that right? Letâ€™s talk about this.
In my opinion, there are so many humans<< who cannot buy a legal version of film or music**T10**Defining**None**50**, who cannot buy a legal version of film or music,>> because they have <<financial**T12**Spelling**None**10**finanshial>> problems. Especially it is happened in poor countries, where a law of publishing <<does not exist**T13**Confusion_of_structures**None**12**is not exist>> and everyone can download everything he/she <<wants**T14**Agreement_errors**None**4**want>> from pirate resourses. <<How to punish all population?**T15**Punctuation**None**29**How to punish all population.>> If every film or music are <<located**T18**lex_item_choice**None**8**situated>> in open <<access**T17**Spelling**None**5**acess>>. <<As for**T20**Prepositions**None**3**For>> other <<reasons**T21**Noun_number**None**6**reason>>, <<it**T19**Capitalisation**None**2**It>> is easier to write your own music or <<make**T22**Often_confused**None**2**do>> <<a film**T23**Articles**None**4**film>><< than**T24**Punctuation**None**6**, than>> to pay a lot of money for every film<< or**T26**Punctuation**None**4**, or>> for <<a musical album**T27**Articles**None**13**musical album>>. I think that some musicians and producers offer their <<creations**T39**lex_item_choice**None**14**entertainments>> for <<a huge amount**T32**Articles**None**11**huge amount>> of money <<, and**T33**Punctuation**None**3**and>> most of the people, who <<have**T34**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> <<an**T35**Articles**None**1**a>> open <<access**T36**Spelling**None**5**acess>> to this, prefer to go to pirates resourses that will pay for it.
It is well known<< that**T37**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> people have to pay for music and films in some <<coutries**T38**Spelling**None**8**contries>>, because the law of protecting rights is there, and almost there humans always want to <<restrict**T39**lex_item_choice**None**6**punish>> illegal content.
In conclusion, I think that there should be a special law, regulating buying and solding content. Only in this case punishing can exist.
