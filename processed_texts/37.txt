The problem of high popularity of pirate content appeared not so long ago <<, but**T1**Punctuation**None**3**but>> everyone has to deal with it in the postmodern era. <<There still is**T2**Standard**None**14**There is still>> no universal <<solution of**T4**Prepositional_noun**None**12**solution for>> this <<problem**T5**lex_item_choice**None**8**question>>.
I do believe that <<an illegal connection**T6**Articles**None**18**illegal connection>> to the pirate content should be punished. Firstly, copying and sharing pirate copies undermine #DELETE#12#the right of <<private**T8**lex_item_choice**None**12**intellectual>> ownership. It leads to money <<losses**T9**Noun_number**None**4**loss>> and a violation of basic right to have <<property**T10**Articles**None**10**a property>>. The situation <<becomes**T11**lex_item_choice**None**4**goes>> even worse if we will not <<recall**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**forget>> the fact that such types of content (music and films) are produced directly by the authors. Secondly, due to <<high popularity**T14**Articles**None**19**the high popularity>> of illegal content <<there**T15**Spelling**None**4**then>> is a reduction of investitions in <<music and films production**T16**Articles**None**30**the music and films production>>. Every project needs to be financed properly <<, and**T18**Punctuation**None**3**and>> there <<should be**T19**Modals**None**2**is>> no exception. It is highly unlikely to create something special <<, if**T20**Punctuation**None**2**if>> <<there is**T21**Tense_choice**None**10**there will>> <<no**T22**lex_item_choice**None**3**not>> <<material base**T23**Articles**None**25**a necessary material base>> #DELETE#5#Tonit. Thirdly, consumers should pay for music and films <<, because**T26**Punctuation**None**7**because>> there is a strong point in <<understanding connection**T28**Transitive**None**27**understanding of connection>> between <<spending your own money**T31**Transitive**None**26**spending of your own money>> and consuming goods. There is no debate in the society <<, whether**T32**Punctuation**None**7**whether>> people should pay for <<airplane tickets**T33**lex_item_choice**None**11**air tickets>> or not. Music and films are not usually associated with classic private goods <<, and**T34**Punctuation**None**3**and>> it has to be changed.
To summarize, <<there are**T35**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**there>> some somewhat strong arguments to <<punishing law violators**T36**Category_confusion**None**31**the punishment of law violators>>. These actions are unjust, selfish and ineffective. They may lead to dramatic reduction of contentâ€™s quality. That would be a huge <<loss**T37**lex_item_choice**None**4**pity>> and a <<lose-lose situation**T38**Category_confusion**None**19**loss-loss situation>>.
