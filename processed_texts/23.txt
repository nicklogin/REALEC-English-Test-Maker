The issue of “content <<content piracy**T1**Category_confusion**None**7**pirates>>” is <<a huge problem**T2**Articles**None**16**the huge problem>> for modern ethics and law. <<An attitude**T3**Articles**None**12**The attitude>> to sharing information in <<the XXI century**T7**Articles**None**11**XXI century>> may be <<influenced by**T9**Category_confusion**None**18**under influence of>> different points of view.
<<Some people**T12**Determiners**None**18**One part of people>> <<prefer to talk**T11**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**11**prefer talk>> about electronic information in terms of “<<intellectual property**T13**Often_confused**None**11**intelligent>> property”. They say that there is no difference between the ways of distributing films or music. <<Even if**T15**Conjunctions**None**4**Even>> somebody <<wants to have**T18**Verb_Inf**None**10**wants have>> them only in digital form, without using CD-disks, he or she still <<has**T16**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> to pay for the products. <<There are reasons for thinking this way**T25**Word_choice**None**19**It has some reasons>> because workers <<spend**T19**Tense_choice**None**5**spent>> their time and <<labour**T20**Spelling**None**5**laber>> <<to make**T21**Infinitive_constr**None**7**to made>> or <<develop**T23**Spelling**None**8**developt>> <<films**T24**Articles**None**9**the films>>, music or soft, and they need to get money for their job. “<<Why is a masterpiece of music**T26**Interrogative**None**40**Why a masterpiecemasterpiece of music is>> less important for customers <<than**T32**Spelling**None**4**that>> <<a masterpiece**T77**Articles**None**11**masterpiece>> of art?” <<Another**T52**Determiners**None**5**Other>> problem is sharing with friends <<- when**T75**Punctuation**None**4**when>> one of them <<gives**T37**Agreement_errors**None**4**give>> another a book, another makes exchange with <<his or her**T39**Agreement_errors**None**3**his>> friend<<, etc.**T8**Punctuation**None**1**…>> Is it “<<piracy**T40**lex_item_choice**None**14**pirate network>>”? <<Usually**T41**Category_confusion**None**8**As usual>>, <<producers**T67**Articles**None**13**the producers>> say “no”. Their powers are enforced against people who make money by <<copying**T42**Transitive**None**10**copying of>> their production.
<<On the contrary**T43**Linking_device**None**15**To the opposite>>, <<others**T44**Ref_device**Dependent_change**11**second part>> <<prefer to talk**T46**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**11**prefer talk>> about free exchange and free flaws of information. Their philosophy is close to <<the anarchist theory**T47**Articles**None**16**anarchist theory>> that <<involves**T49**lex_item_choice**None**5**means>> the rise of human knowledge and solidarity #DELETE#16#in the situation. “If someone really likes the product, he or she will go to <<the cinema**T51**Articles**None**6**cinema>>, or donate money <<to**T4**Prepositions**None**3**for>> the author. The biggest part of price is <<the outcome**T48**Articles**None**7**outcome>> of labels greed<<, **T35**Spelling**None**4**”, ->> they say. And sometimes it happens: people buy a game to support <<a game studio**T76**Articles**None**15**the game studio>> and go to the concerts because they <<liked**T56**Tense_choice**None**4**like>> <<an illegally downloaded album**T57**Articles**None**26**illegally downloaded album>>. And these people share <<information**T58**Articles**None**15**the information>> because they enjoy it and try to help strangers to feel it <<б ещщ**T61**Punctuation**None**3**too>>.
<<All in all**T63**Linking_device**None**9**Generally>>, both sides have <<reasonable arguments**T62**Absence_explanation**None**9**arguments>>. For me <<the conception**T64**Articles**None**10**conception>> of <<free exchange**T65**lex_item_choice**None**12**free-sharing>> is more modern and essential for digital society. <<It may also stimulate**T66**Standard**None**21**It also may stimulate>> producers to do their job better. I mean, if their film is interesting and important, I will go to the cinema. If an album is unusual, I will buy tickets to premiere of it. <<Maybe**T70**Punctuation**None**7**May be,>> if people just do their job perfectly, the problem will be resolved. The success of European <<Pirate Party**T77**Capitalisation**None**12**Pirate party>> supports this opinion.
