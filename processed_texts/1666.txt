<<Nowadays**T370**Spelling**None**7**Nowdays>> there are different suggestions about using illegal drugs in sport. Some people <<think that**T371**Punctuation**None**11**think, that>> it would be fair to ban <<sportsmen who use steroids**T372**Defining**None**28**sportsmen, who use steroids,>> for not <<a very long period**T373**Articles**None**16**very long period>>. <<Others**T374**Pronouns**Dependent_change**5**Other>> <<say that**T376**Punctuation**None**9**say, that>> there is only one <<justice**T379**Spelling**None**7**justies>>: <<ban this athlete from**T418**Prepositional_verb**None**19**ban this athlete in>> professional sport <<forever**T415**lex_item_choice**None**11**permanently>>.
On the one hand, it is <<honest**T380**Category_confusion**None**8**honestly>> to ban <<an athlete**T415**Articles**None**7**athlete>> from sport for not <<a very long period**T383**Articles**None**16**very long period>>, because time for <<a professional sportsman**T384**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**professional>> is very <<important**T385**lex_item_choice**None**6**matter>>, so 2 years can cost for him as 20 years. Moreover, if <<a person**T386**Articles**None**6**person>> cheated and <<then**T387**Spelling**None**4**than>> <<was caught**T388**Voice**None**6**caught>>, it is not very significant how many years he will be banned, because for all people he will be <<a cheater**T389**Articles**None**7**cheater>> forever. For instance, professional boxer John Jones<<, who was caught in 2016 for using steroids,**T390**Non_defining**None**43**, who was caught in 2016 for using steroids>> now for most people and his fans is only <<a cheater**T391**Articles**None**7**cheater>>.
On the other hand, athletes who use illegal drugs to improve their results in sport should be punished <<strictlier**T393**Comparative_adv**None**13**more strictly>>, than, for example, 2 years. Furthermore, <<not only should they be banned**T419**Emphatic**None**30**they should be not only banned>>, but they must <<be deprived of**T420**lex_item_choice**None**16**be excluded from>> all <<sport**T421**Noun_attribute**None**7**sport's>> salaries and his or her own <<achievements**T395**Spelling**None**11**achievments>> in sport. For example, <<a teammate**T397**Articles**None**8**teammate>> of Usein Bolt<<, which was caught by using illegal drugs,**T398**Non_defining**None**39**, who was caught by using illegal drugs>> was not only <<banned**T399**Spelling**None**6**bannes>>, but <<deprived of**T400**lex_item_choice**None**13**excluded from>> <<the gold medal**T401**Articles**None**10**gold medal>><< which he received in 2004 year**T402**Defining**None**32**, which he received in 2004 year>>.
In my opinion, <<a person**T403**Articles**None**10**the person>> who was caught by using steroids must be banned at least for 5 years. I think it is <<a fair punishment**T406**Articles**None**15**fair punishment>> for <<a crime**T404**Articles**None**5**crime>><< like this**T405**Punctuation**None**11**, like this>>. At the same time, I believe<< that**T407**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> all people <<who**T408**Defining**None**5**which>> were caught should be put under research of <<a special comission**T409**Articles**None**17**special comission>>, because sometimes, sportsmen's haters can put some drugs in <<their**T422**Agreement_errors**None**3**his>> food or water. So, it is reasonable to <<say that**T413**Punctuation**None**10**say, that,>> <<the commission**T423**Articles**None**9**comission>> should find <<those who**T412**Defining**None**10**those, who>> <<committed**T410**lex_item_choice**None**3**did>> this crime. I <<can't**T414**Spelling**None**4**cant>> deny an admirable idea to ban cheaters from sport for the rest of their lives, but I think, it is too <<cruel**T415**lex_item_choice**None**7**crusial>> to do it, because it can be a mistake.
