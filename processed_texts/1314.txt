<<The majority**T1**Articles**None**8**Majority>> of people think that the main cause of <<the increasing number**T2**Articles**None**17**increasing number>> of diseases is <<the overuse of**T5**Absence_comp_colloc**None**11**the overuse>> <<technology**T4**Articles**None**14**the technology>>. This essay firstly <<discusses**T6**Tense_choice**None**12**will discuss>> the main cause of <<health problems**T7**Articles**None**19**the health problems>><<, secondly,**T8**Punctuation**None**10**, secondly>> the essay <<offers**T9**Tense_choice**None**10**will offer>> some solutions. 

First of all, the cause of <<a great number**T10**Articles**None**16**the great number>> of health problems is not the technology, but  overusing technology in life. Before <<the widespread use**T11**Absence_explanation**None**10**widespread>> of televisions and phones people preferred to meet each other, to walk in parks, <<to**T12**Spelling**None**1**o>> spend time with family, <<to play**T13**Infinitive_constr**None**7**playing>> sport games, or even to camp. Nowadays more and more individuals spend their free time behind <<a TV**T14**Articles**None**2**TV>> or computer. For example, it can be noticed that children like to play videogames <<nowadays**T15**lex_item_choice**None**14**in modern life>><< may**T16**Punctuation**None**5**, may>> be even more than <<play football, basketball with each other**T17**Standard**None**44**play with each other in football, basketball>> and <<doing other activities**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**other activities>>. 

Nevertheless, some <<solutions**T19**Noun_number**None**8**solution>> to the problem <<exist**T20**Tense_form**None**9**are exist>>. The government can provide social programs to stimulate people to do sport, it can <<protect**T21**lex_item_choice**None**7**predict>> them from health problems. For example, they can create different  programs with <<a sport activity**T22**Articles**None**14**sport activity>> in parks, people will <<try**T23**lex_item_choice**None**8**interest>> something new <<, and,**T24**Punctuation**None**3**and>> if they <<spend**T25**Conditionals**None**10**will spend>> more time on thresh air, it will be a good point for their health. The government can also provide help for some groups, for instance, to buy <<certificates**T26**lex_item_choice**None**4**card>> to <<a gym**T27**Articles**None**3**gym>> with sales. 

To conclude, the main cause of <<the majority**T28**Articles**None**8**majority>> of diseases in present is the widespread use of modern  technology. People forget about activities, sport and <<the benefit**T29**Articles**None**7**benefit>> of fresh air and spend a lot of time on the sofa behind the TV and computers. Government should stimulate people to do <<sport**T31**Punctuation**None**5**sport>>, <<by providing**T30**Conjunctions**None**9**providing>> social programs and help.
