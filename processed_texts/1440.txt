It is commonly agreed that <<the frequent use**T1**Category_confusion**None**15**frequently used>> new technology <<causes**T2**lex_item_choice**None**10**increasing>> <<a variety**T3**Articles**None**7**variety>> of heath issues.

<<Firs of all,**T4**Punctuation**None**12**First of all>> lets look at #DELETE#4#what <<specifically**T6**Spelling**None**12**specificllly>> health issues we <<are talking**T7**Tense_form**None**7**talking>> about. One of the problems is the rays that are produced by your devices. Sometimes it <<causes**T8**Tense_choice**None**7**causing>> you <<a headache**T9**Articles**None**8**headache>>, stress and a lot of attention sometimes <<is focused**T10**Voice**None**7**focused>> not on work but on spending time <<in your device**T11**Prepositions**None**16**with your device>>. <<Also,**T12**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> if you spend too much time sitting by <<tv**T13**Articles**None**6**the TV>> or playing games, or working on computer <<it can cause**T14**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**can cause>> you <<the decrease of**T17**Prepositions**None**22**the decrease your eyes>> health and even damage them so much that you can lose your focus. <<For example,**T18**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> <<because of**T19**Prepositions**None**11**because for>> my studying sphere, which is design, I have to work on my computer a lot, and because of that I can barely see what is faraway and when I was younger my eyes could see everything perfectly. <<So,**T20**Punctuation**None**2**So>>  because of <<the time**T21**Articles**None**7**my time>> spent on the computer today I frequently have a headache, my vision is blurred, <<I am**T22**Inappropriate_register**None**3**I’m>> always on nerves, <<cannot**T23**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> #DELETE#6#barely calm down, sometimes I <<lose**T25**Tense_choice**None**7**loosing>> the words<< that I tried to say**T26**Punctuation**None**21**, that I tried to say>> because I easily <<lose**T27**Tense_choice**None**7**loosing>> my <<concentration**T28**Category_confusion**None**11**concentrate>>.

<<Second,**T29**Punctuation**None**6**Second>> lets reconsider the ways of how to reduce the damage. You <<cannot**T30**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> ignore the damage that <<is caused**T31**Voice**None**6**caused>> by modern devices, so we should find <<a way to**T32**Prepositions**None**8**a way of>> first: how to reduce <<the damage**T33**Articles**None**6**damage>>; second: how to get <<rid**T34**Spelling**None**3**tid>> of damaging <<the health**T35**Articles**None**6**health>>.  <<So,**T36**Punctuation**None**2**So>> the answer to the questions is simple. The thing that we <<cannot**T37**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> live without is the thing that we need right now – oxygen. We should spend more time <<in the fresh air**T38**Prepositions**None**16**on the fresh air>>, so it will decrease pit headaches and provide us with <<calmness**T39**Spelling**None**8**calmnesy>>. <<And also,**T40**Punctuation**None**8**And also>> no matter how cliché it sounds <<, you shoud**T41**Punctuation**None**10**you should>> meditate for an hour a day, so your eyes can relax and your mind and all your body.

<<To sum up,**T42**Punctuation**None**9**To sum up>> we can say that <<problems**T43**Noun_number**Dependent_change**7**problem>> with health <<are touched**T44**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**10**is touched>> by everyone. Because even our <<grandmothers**T45**Spelling**None**13**grand mothers>> #DELETE#7#even if <<did not use phones**T47**Tense_choice**None**16**not using phones>>, #DELETE#5#using TV’s and preferred to <<spend**T50**Tense_choice**None**5**spent>> their time indoors, than outdoors, and <<that is the problem,**T52**Punctuation**None**19**that is the problem>> people should spend more time outside, breathe the fresh air and relax by meditating and also do some yoga to correct your posture if sitting too much with your laptop.
