<<Nowadays**T1**Spelling**None**7**Nowdays>> pirates are not<< who burglar ships adn kill sailors**T3**Punctuation**None**36**, who burglar ships and kill sailors>>, <<they are**T4**Pronouns**None**5**it is>> people who steal music, films, books or something like this <<on**T5**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the <<Internet**T6**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. But there is a question if they should be punished.
It is <<obvious**T7**Spelling**None**7**obivous>> that people<< who earn money from legal products**T8**Defining**None**37**, who earn money from legal products,>> <<want people who download or share pirate copies be punished**T10**Verb_object_bare**None**62**want people who download or share pirate copies to be punished>>, as it’s illegal. Every country has <<special**T11**Spelling**None**8**speacial>> laws to protect authors from stealing their works.
To my mind, there should be such prohibitions only <<for**T12**Prepositions**None**2**on>> works<< which author is alive**T13**Defining**None**25**, which authors are alive>>, because <<there are**T14**Abs_comp_clause**None**5**there>> a lot of companies who have the <<authors**T17**Possessive**None**6**author>> rights to works of dead people, and they forbid to share the music or books even if the author wasn’t mad at such sharing. Sharing books can <<raise**T18**Often_confused**None**4**rise>> the level of education of people, and this is one of the proses of pirates.
<<Nowadays**T2**Spelling**None**7**Nowdays>> there are a lot of web sites<< where you can watch films legally**T19**Punctuation**None**36**, where you can watch films legally,>> but you have to watch the advertisment first. The advert brings huge money, so the authors can earn money. <<In my opinion,**T21**Punctuation**None**13**In my opinion>> such way is the most appropriate to develop <<the industry**T22**Articles**None**8**industry>> of music or cinema. <<Those who**T23**Pronouns**None**5**Those>> want to watch a film or listen to music shouldn’t pay money for it. Art should be free.
I also disagree with the opinion tha producers lose a huge money because of the pirates. There <<is**T24**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> always someone who wants to buy a legal product <<, so**T25**Punctuation**None**2**so>> they spend money for it. <<Otherwise**T26**Spelling**None**9**Othervise>> someone just <<doesn't have**T27**Agreement_errors**None**10**don’t have>> money for such entertainment, so they use <<pirate**T28**Spelling**None**5**pirat>> copies. But the money<< which producers get from their popular works**T29**Defining**None**46**, which producers get from their popular works>> are always huge.
