Over the last few decades there were enormous changes in the way people can get an access to various pieces of <<media art**T1**Spelling**None**9**media-art>>, including music and films. One of the questions causing numerous discussions is whether people should be punished for downloading <<media files**T2**Spelling**None**11**media-files>> or not.
<<To begin with,**T3**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**To begin>>, those who believe that <<downloading music**T4**Transitive**None**20**downloading of music>> and movies is extremely bad for musicians and producers are completely right. Firstly, a person <<a person who just steals these files from web-sites**T5**Punctuation**None**43**who just steals these files from web-sites,>> <<refuses**T6**lex_item_choice**None**6**denies>> to admit and take into account all the work that thousands of people have done while creating a movie or a music album, and also all the money<< that were spent on turning these projects into life**T7**Defining**None**53**, that were spent on turning these projects into life>>. Secondly, if someone spreads the links <<to**T9**Prepositions**None**2**on>> these files all over the social-media pages, he or she does not only turn himself or herself into a thief, but also shows <<to the other people**T10**Prepositions**None**16**the other people>> that it is completely normal and acceptable.
However, there are also those <<who think,**T11**Punctuation**None**9**who think>> it is not an actual theft to download <<media files**T13**Spelling**None**11**media-files>> from the <<Internet**T12**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. Instead, the files <<have already been**T14**Tense_choice**None**12**were already>> there and you do not do anything wrong by just watching them <<on**T15**Prepositions**None**4**from>> your laptop. Furthermore, people do not find any other solutions, because the prices in cinemas are too high, but they still want to broaden their minds by watching good films. Thus, if you do it with a good educational purpose – it is not a theft.
Although, there <<is**T16**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> some truth in the arguments above, I still agree with those people who believe that “downloading” equals “stealing”, because most of people do not actually know how expensive it is to create a movie or a song.
To sum up, copying and sharing <<media files**T17**Spelling**None**11**media-files>> on the <<Internet**T18**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> is bad, that is why the government should create a social programme<< that will help to make music and films more affordable**T19**Defining**None**57**, that will help to make music and films more affordable,>> so everyone would be able to enjoy these pieces of art.
