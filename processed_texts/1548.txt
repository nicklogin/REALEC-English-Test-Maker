Nowadays the problem of the use of drugs is quite important, <<especially**T1**Spelling**None**11**especcially>> in sport. Lots of sportsmen were caught using them and lost the chance to come back to professional sport. This caused great discussions all over the world. There are other points of view that will be reflected in this essay.
<<On**T2**Spelling**None**3**One>> one hand, drugs are prohibited almost everywhere and nobody can make or use it or he/she will be judged and go to prison. Sportsmen are not <<unusual**T4**Spelling**None**8**unusuall>> and outstanding people who are allowed to take them. So, the one who did it should not only be banned from competing professionally but even be judged. It is an illegal action that should be punished. And the best punishment for a sportsman is a banning from all the competitions for the rest of his/her life.
On the other hand, everyone should have a chance to make himself better, to recognize mistakes and <<do his best**T5**Redundant_comp**None**15**do all his best>> to <<correct**T6**lex_item_choice**None**7**improve>> <<them**T7**Pronouns**None**2**it>>. If there is an opportunity that if a sportsman was banned, he would not repeat such actions anymore. Hence, the punishment for two years without professional competitions would be fair. For example, I know a tennis player who was caught using illegal drugs and she was banned for 1 year. Since that time she has never used drugs and even joined anti-drug club in Moscow.
<<Although,**T3**Punctuation**None**8**Although>> many people believe, that the use of illegal drugs is illegal action, I suppose that everyone could do something wrong and schould be forgiven at first time. The feeling of compassion is a Christian value but it is worth following by any person.
To conclude, it is essential to say that the issue of drugs in professional sport is a problem, the government and sport comitees tackle with but it hasn't been solved yet. People should evocate more time for its solution and try to find the right choice.
