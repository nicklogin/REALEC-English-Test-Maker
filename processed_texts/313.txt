Nowadays, with a help of new <<technologies**T1**Spelling**None**11**techonogies>> we have <<an opportunity**T2**Articles**None**11**opportunity>> to download new films and music without any payment. However, this leads to the <<loss**T3**Spelling**None**4**lost>> of huge amounts of money by musicians and film producers. So should modern pirates be punished? In this <<essay**T4**Spelling**None**5**essey>> I will explain why it should be so.
First of all, due to losing money from illegal pirate copies some film producers do not have any chances to continue film production. That is why many good <<films**T5**Noun_number**None**4**film>> will not appear in the cinemas. Or it can take a lot of time for film producers to find some sponsorships. Anyway, it also may be a problem if producer’s name is not worldwide <<known**T6**Spelling**None**6**knowen>>. I think that to <<solve**T7**lex_item_choice**None**6**solute>> such problem it is nesseccary for government to help film producers to decrease the cost of cinema tickets and DVD discs. It will lead to pirate copies reduction. If it is impossible, pirates must be punished with an expensive fee.
Another problem made by illegal copies is that some video clips appear on the Internet before <<its**T8**Spelling**None**4**it’s>> official <<release**T9**Spelling**None**6**relise>>. This happened with a Eurovision <<competitor**T10**Spelling**None**10**compitetor>> several years ago. So two weeks before the concert <<a lot**T11**Articles**None**3**lot>> of people heard his song. I hope that government will find ways to stop such <<pirates**T14**Possessive**None**7**pirates>> behavior. 
Finally, unpunished copying and sharing music and <<films**T12**Noun_number**None**4**film>> on the Internet show to young generation that it is normal. So I believe that if this situation <<is not stopped**T13**Voice**None**13**does not stop>> now, in future people will have much more problems with illegal copies.
