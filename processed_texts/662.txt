If government will not decline the number of airplanes now, our children would have problem with clean air or fresh water. The number of end<<endangered**T17**Spelling**None**9**endengerd>>e<<species**T18**Spelling**None**8**specious>>uld grow every year because of flo<<global**T19**Spelling**None**6**flobal>>rming.
