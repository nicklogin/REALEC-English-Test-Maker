Today in our society the problem of <<pirate copies of pieces of art**T13**Absence_explanation**None**13**pirate copies>> is very actual. In many <<countries**T1**Noun_number**None**7**country>> <<there are laws**T2**Word_choice**None**29**the legislatures propose laws>> <<on**T4**Prepositions**None**5**about>> <<persecuting**T14**lex_item_choice**None**14**punishment for>> <<it**T99**lex_item_choice**None**4**this>>, but <<there is no consensus in the world**T105**Word_choice**None**40**in the world didn’t exist some consencas>> about that<<,**T106**Punctuation**None**1**.>> and this question <<is very often discussed**T5**Voice**None**24**is very often discussing>>.
The first part of <<people**T8**Noun_number**None**7**peoples>> says that <<punishing pirates is necessary**T16**Standard**Dependent_change**34**punishing is necessary for pirates>>. First of all, they argument that every work must <<be paid**T18**Word_choice**None**15**have the salary>>, and the biggest part of <<artists**T97**Possessive**None**5**tists>> <<salary of those who produce films and music**T20**Absence_explanation**None**6**salary>> is the sum of money that they <<gain**T21**Tense_choice**None**6**gained>> when someone <<buys**T22**Tense_choice**None**6**buying>> <<their**T23**Agreement_errors**None**3**his>> product. <<It is logical**T25**Confusion_of_structures**None**10**Logically,>> that if nobody <<buys**T26**Tense_choice**None**15**wouldn’t to buy>> <<an original product**T97**Articles**None**12**the original>> because <<they**T29**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> prefer to download <<films**T31**Noun_number**None**8**the film>> or music for free, then artists will <<have no**T32**Tense_form**None**7**haven’t>> motivation to create more, because <<their**T33**Agreement_errors**None**3**his>> work <<won't**T34**Tense_choice**None**5**can’t>> give them <<any money**T35**Determiners**None**7**a money>>. As a result, the industry of art <<will lose**T30**Tense_choice**None**9**to losing>> not only <<money**T38**Articles**None**7**a money>>, but <<, what is more important**T97**Punctuation**None**22**what is more important>>, <<talents**T40**Articles**None**9**a talents>> who want to <<give people**T41**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> <<creative work of their genius**T42**Word_choice**None**15**genius creation>> and gain money for that.
Also, other <<opinions**T36**lex_item_choice**None**4**part>> exist too. Some <<people**T10**Noun_number**None**7**peoples>> <<are sure**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**sures>><< that**T44**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> the punishment for sharing music or films for free is <<a terrible idea**T45**Articles**None**13**terrible idea>>! Firstly, they argue<< that**T47**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> art should be free because everyone must have <<access**T11**Articles**None**9**an access>> <<to**T48**Prepositions**None**3**for>> all <<works**T49**lex_item_choice**None**9**creations>> of art#DELETE#1#, <<in order to have**T51**Confusion_of_structures**None**8**for have>> more possibilities to <<develop**T52**Spelling**None**8**developp>><<,**T53**Punctuation**None**1**.>> but not all <<people**T54**Noun_number**None**7**peoples>> can buy <<every song they like**T24**Absence_explanation**None**10**every song>>, for example, #DELETE#20#that pretty for him, it’s too expensive, #DELETE#50#and this man or woman may haven’t a money for that. Secondly, when someone <<wants**T57**lex_item_choice**None**5**would>> to buy something, <<it is necessary**T58**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**it necessary>> to know the quality of this <<piece**T59**lex_item_choice**None**8**creation>> and often <<people**T60**Noun_number**None**7**peoples>> <<don't have**T61**Tense_form**None**7**haven’t>> <<any**T37**Often_confused**None**4**some>> possibility to check it. For example, <<music**T63**Articles**None**7**a music>>. One can’t understand <<whether  it satisfies his or her needs**T46**Conjunctions**None**30**is it satisfy his or her needs>> while <<listening to it once**T97**lex_item_choice**None**7**hearing>>, but <<it is impossible**T68**Absence_comp_sent**None**13**it impossible>> to <<hear it more than once**T69**Absence_explanation**None**7**hear it>> when buying. <<When pirate copies exist,**T72**Punctuation**None**24**When pirate copies exist>> <<it is possible**T73**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**it possible>> to find <<a concrete song**T75**Articles**None**13**concrete song>> <<on**T76**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the Internet**T77**Articles**None**8**Internet>> and <<hear it**T97**Transitive**None**5**heare>> before buying and then one <<will know**T81**Tense_choice**None**4**know>> <<if it is necessary to buy it**T97**Standard**None**25**is it necessary to buy it>>. <<The same situation iexists with films**T83**Absence_comp_sent**None**29**The same situation with films>>. <<A trailer**T85**Articles**None**7**Trailer>> of <<a film**T80**Articles**None**4**film>> can’t give <<information**T98**Articles**None**15**the information>> about real quality of <<the product**T84**Articles**None**7**product>>, and when someone can watch <<a part**T86**Articles**None**8**the part>> of film <<on**T87**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the Internet**T88**Articles**None**8**Internet>>, then he or she will go to the cinema to watch it in <<high resolution**T91**Articles**None**19**the high resolution>>#DELETE#1#, or buy <<a blue-ray disk**T101**Articles**None**13**blue-ray disk>>.
Finally, personally I think<< that**T92**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> pirate copies have many advantages and <<it is really bad**T93**Absence_comp_sent**None**13**it really bad>> to <<persecute**T103**lex_item_choice**None**6**punish>> for <<using or spreading them**T94**Absence_explanation**None**4**that>>, because sometimes <<without them authors can lose money**T95**Word_choice**None**43**it can’t provide to money loses for authors>>.
