Nowadays lots of people around the world have <<an increasing number**T1**Articles**None**17**increasing number>> of health problems because of modern technologies. And <<the amount**T43**lex_item_choice**None**6**number>> of these people <<rises**T4**Spelling**None**5**raise>> <<significantly**T5**Spelling**None**13**sagnificantly>> from day to day.

One of the most popular problems is <<troubles**T6**Noun_number**None**7**trouble>> with eyes. Millions of people <<read**T7**Tense_choice**None**7**reading>> all information, <<watch**T8**Tense_choice**None**8**watching>> films and programmes <<on**T9**Prepositions**None**4**from>> small displays. So, they get problems with their eyes. 

Newerhteless,  <<there is one more problem**T10**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**one more problem>> – neck-ache and troubles with back. This type of health <<problems**T11**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> they get because they <<sit every day in**T12**Prepositions**None**19**sit every day under>> their smartphones, computers, so their bones <<start to grow**T13**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**10**start grow>> in <<a false way**T14**Articles**None**9**false way>>.  And they start to <<go**T15**lex_item_choice**None**3**run>> to doctors. 

Also, one of the biggest problems <<is connected**T17**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**connected>> with <<mental**T16**lex_item_choice**None**6**psycho>> health of our <<children**T18**Spelling**None**9**ehilolnen>>. Because of <<the Internet**T43**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>, social <<medias**T21**Noun_number**None**5**media>>, they <<do not talk to**T23**Prepositions**None**16**do not talk with>> each other and <<do not have**T24**Tense_choice**None**11**has not got>> any <<communication**T25**Category_confusion**None**13**communicative>> skills. 

However, <<there is a solution**T26**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**solution>> of <<these**T28**Ref_device**None**4**this>> problems #DELETE#7#has got. There are lots of ways which can help you reduce <<these**T29**Ref_device**None**4**this>> troubles. First of all, you should <<regularly**T30**Spelling**None**8**regulary>> go to <<a doctor**T31**Articles**None**6**doctor>>, minimum twice <<in a half-year**T32**Prepositions**None**14**on a half-year>>. If you <<do not**T34**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> want <<problems**T35**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> with eyes, you should make some trainings for them and sit <<in a right way**T36**Prepositions**None**14**on a right way>>. Modern displays should be straight belove your eyes, minimum in 90 santimetres. To reduce problems with neck and back, people should do trainings, about 10 minutes every morning. <<Also,**T37**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> they should <<take**T38**lex_item_choice**None**2**fo>> massage courses twice a year to make their bones right way. And to say about children problems, I want to tell that parents should more carefully look after their children. <<They need to**T39**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**To walk>> with them  with no gadgets, to take them off sometimes, <<to teach their child to live**T40**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**25**to teach their child live>> in this world. 

To sum up, I want to say that health problems connected with modern technologies are really widespread. People make troubles to their health by themselves. But, I believe that <<, f every person start listen to their body and look after it**T41**Punctuation**None**60**if every person start listen to their body and look after it>>, there <<will not**T42**Inappropriate_register**None**5**won’t>> be any problems in <<their future life**T43**Absence_explanation**None**11**future life>>.
