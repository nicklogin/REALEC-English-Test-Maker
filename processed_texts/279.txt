Today we live in the century<< where**T1**Punctuation**None**7**, where>> the information is the most expensive thing<< that we can have**T2**Defining**None**18**, that we can have>>. All of our <<knowledges**T3**Spelling**None**9**knowleges>>, all of our ideas – everything of it is information. It can <<sound**T4**Voice**None**8**be sound>> strange, but art is information too. Today technologies – our best friend <<, and**T5**Punctuation**None**3**and>> with their help we can do everything.
Also we can find products of art <<on**T6**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet and download it <<with**T7**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the only click. But not everybody <<thinks**T8**Agreement_errors**None**5**think>><< that**T9**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> it’s always good.
Some people assume<< that**T10**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<the Internet**T11**Articles**None**8**Internet>> – users must use only legal ways to find and take information – buy it on <<official**T12**Spelling**None**7**oficial>> sourses. They say<< that**T13**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> creators of films and music lose huge amounts of money because of i-pirates and pirate copies. So, if we want to help people we like, we should give them some money for their works. That is their first argument. The second is that it’s totally <<unfair to use**T14**Punctuation**None**17**unfair, to choose>> easy and cheap ways and use someone’s work without <<a fee**T16**Articles**None**3**fee>>. In addition, they think<< that**T17**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> unfair people should be punished for their internet crimes.
Another part of people use pirate copies and <<, of course,**T18**Punctuation**None**9**of course>> they don’t want to be punished. They don’t pay money because, at first, it’s so expensive and not everybody can allow <<this**T19**Spelling**None**3**his>> to himself. Secondly, most things<< that they download**T20**Defining**None**21**, that they download,>> don’t have their author alive and they won’t receive money. <<Children or other people who are unfair in this case too can take this money.**T21**Standard**None**77**This money can take children or other people who are unfair in this case too.>>
As for me, I think<< that**T23**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> I <<don't need**T24**Modals**None**7**needn’t>> pay for <<the information**T25**Articles**None**11**information>> I need, because it’s the main sourse in our life. <<If i had more information, I could share and broaden it**T29**Conditionals**None**55**If I had more information, I could share and broaden it>>, it’s more useful for everybody. So I think<< that**T27**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> we can solve this problem by lowing prices and having new rules of internet purchases.
