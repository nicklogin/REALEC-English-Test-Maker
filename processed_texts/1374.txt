One <<cannot**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> deny that <<technologies**T2**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> <<have**T3**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> changed the world that we live in for good over just a few decades. <<They**T4**Ref_device**None**2**It>> <<have**T5**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> become an <<important**T6**lex_item_choice**None**9**essential>> part of our lives, something we <<cannot**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> have fun <<and**T8**Conjunctions**None**2**of>> communicate without, but is it really all that good or are there <<some downsides**T9**Absence_explanation**None**9**downsides>> <<for us**T10**Prepositions**None**5**to us>> <<of using**T11**Prepositions**None**5**using>> <<too**T12**lex_item_choice**None**2**so>> much of <<them**T13**Ref_device**None**2**it>> all the time?

One of the issues that has come to the <<mind**T14**lex_item_choice**None**9**attention>> of many with the rise of <<technologies**T15**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> is that <<they**T16**Ref_device**None**2**it>> can sometimes cause problems with health and the number of <<these**T17**Ref_device**None**5**those>> problems <<increases**T18**Tense_choice**None**13**is increasing>> all the time. 

For instance, due to the <<materials**T19**lex_item_choice**None**6**nature>> of the screens that are now a part of almost any technological device <<, and**T20**Punctuation**None**3**and>> also <<when**T21**Conjunctions**None**10**because of>> people <<stare**T22**Tense_choice**None**7**staring>> at them for many hours every day, many <<start**T23**Tense_choice**None**12**have started>> to feel that their eyes tire <<faster**T25**Spelling**None**6**fasted>> than usual and because of that the number of problems with eyesight has increased dramatically. 

<<The other**T26**lex_item_choice**None**7**Another>> thing that is worth our attention is that people <<slouch**T27**Spelling**None**6**slauch>> a lot while using computers and smartphones <<, which**T28**Punctuation**None**5**which>> causes <<back**T29**lex_item_choice**None**7**posture>> problems that are difficult to treat.

One of the ways in what the problem can be reduced is to mind our posture and the time we spend staring at our screens. One should use a comfortable chair while working on <<a computer**T30**Articles**None**8**computer>> and try to keep their face 30-40 centimeters from the screen. Another way to deal with this issue is to do regular exercises for eyes and posture, for example, while having small 5-10 minute breaks. This way our eyes and back <<will not**T31**Inappropriate_register**None**5**won’t>> tire so fast and we will at least have a chance of reducing the damage that <<technologies**T24**Noun_number**Dependent_change**10**technology>> <<cause**T32**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**6**causes>> to our health, <<although,**T33**Punctuation**None**8**although>> probably not eliminate it altogether.

All in all, <<technologies**T34**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> is not something that is always good for us, but it <<does not**T35**Inappropriate_register**None**7**doesn’t>> mean that we <<cannot**T36**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> deal with the problems <<they**T37**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**it>> <<cause**T38**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**6**causes>>. We just have to adapt to our new reality and act accordingly to <<take the best**T39**lex_item_choice**None**13**make the most>> of our lives.
