Nowadays, it is very popular to <<download, copy**T3**Punctuation**None**13**download copy>> and <<share**T2**Category_confusion**None**7**sharing>> music and films. Because of it musicians and film producers <<do not**T308**Spelling**None**5**donot>> get their money. Some people think that people who do it must be punished. <<At the same time,**T5**Punctuation**None**16**At the same time>> there is another point of view.
As for me, I can not agree that such people should be punished. In our modern world it is much easier to download files than buy the original discs. For example, all people now use <<the Internet**T6**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. They simply can do two clicks and get the needed things. The next reason is money. Some people, especially children and students, can not afford to buy the original discs. He or she should not be punished only for <<the lack**T7**Articles**None**4**lack>> of money. <<If somebody really loves music and films,**T9**Punctuation**None**40**If somebody really loves music and films>> nothing will stop him.
However, most people do not support this idea. They consider that everybody should pay for musicians’ and producers’ work. First of all, creators of music and films spend <<a huge amount**T10**Articles**None**11**huge amount>> of money and efforts on their works. That is why honest people must pay for original discs. It is fair. Secondly, people who copy and share the files not always do it in a good way. <<As**T12**Prepositions**None**2**In>> <<a result**T13**Articles**None**6**result>>, <<downloaded**T14**Derivation**None**8**download>> files are in a very bad quality. While <<Bad**T312**Capitalisation**Dependent_change**3**bad>> quality can spoil the opinion about a good film or <<piece of music**T323**Absence_explanation**None**5**music>>.
In conclusion, I would like to say that illegal pirate copies <<make things worse**T314**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**make worse>> for <<the original creators**T316**Articles**None**17**original creators>>. But not <<all people**T319**Absence_explanation**None**3**all>> can <<afford**T317**Often_confused**None**16**allow themselves>> to buy <<the original discs**T322**Articles**None**14**original discs>>. So, these discs should be more <<affordable**T15**lex_item_choice**None**10**acceptable>>.
