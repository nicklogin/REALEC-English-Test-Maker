Both diagrams illustrate proportions of different goods#DELETE#1#, transported by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. Overall, the main type of goods#DELETE#1#, distributed by rail in the considered year#DELETE#1#, is metals, while for road it is food products.
<<First of all**T3**lex_item_choice**None**13**To start with>>, it can be seen from the chart that <<almost**T4**lex_item_choice**None**6**nearly>> one <<quarter**T16**Spelling**None**6**quater>> of all products transported both by rail and by road <<were**T15**Tense_form**None**3**was>> manufactured ones. For other types of goods there is a different proportion in every chart. The most <<substantial**T5**Spelling**None**11**substencial>> difference is in the transported metals: they share 35% in rail transportation of goods, compared with only 11% in the #DELETE#10#one of the <<road transportation**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**road>>. Another <<striking**T6**Spelling**None**9**stricking>> feature of the diagrams is that <<the proportion**T17**Articles**None**10**proportion>> of machinery#DELETE#1#, distributed by rail#DELETE#1#, is sixfold bigger than the <<percent**T9**Spelling**None**8**per cent>> of the same product#DELETE#1#, transported by road.
In conclusion, the shares of manufactured goods in transportation are equal for both road and rail <<transportation**T11**lex_item_choice**None**12**distribution>>, while proportions of other goods <<vary**T12**Tense_choice**None**6**varied>> significantly.
