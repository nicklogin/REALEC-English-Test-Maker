The chart illustrates how unemployment <<rates**T17**Noun_number**None**4**rate>> changed in different regions of the world#DELETE#11#. In period from 2014 to 2015.
It is evident that tendencies in selected world parts differ #DELETE#15#from each other, but if <<we talk**T3**Tense_choice**None**7**talking>> about <<the whole world**T4**lex_item_choice**None**9**worldwide>>, it should be said that the unemployment rate was stable and did not increase or fall from 5,9 points.
<<To be precise,**T21**Linking_device**None**13**In particular>> the biggest rate of unemployment was in <<North Africa**T5**Articles**None**16**the North Africa>> and <<showed**T6**Tense_form**None**5**shown>> the result of 12,5 percent both in 2014 and 2015. Stability is the feature of <<one more region - South Africa,**T22**Word_choice**None**16**South Africa too>> as it <<showed**T8**Tense_form**None**5**shown>> 3,9 percent rate in <<the selected years**T23**Articles**None**14**selected years>>. The opposite can be said about <<the Middle East**T9**Articles**None**11**Middle East>>, <<the European Union**T10**Articles**None**14**European Union>> and Latin America, but tendencies in these regions were not the same. For example, the unemployment rate in <<the Middle East**T11**Articles**None**11**Middle East>> dropped down from 11 to 3,6 percent <<, while**T18**Punctuation**None**5**while>> <<the EU**T12**Articles**None**2**EU>> experienced <<the growth**T13**Category_confusion**None**11**the growing>> of <<the unemployment rate**T14**Articles**None**17**unemployment rate>> from 7,5 to 7,9 percent <<, which**T19**Coordinate**None**4**when>> can be <<considered to be**T25**lex_item_choice**None**13**considered as>> <<the outcome**T26**Noun_number**None**8**outcomes>> of some #DELETE#12#not relevant economic decisions.
