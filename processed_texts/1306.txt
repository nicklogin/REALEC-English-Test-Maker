Nowadays the quick growth of the number of health problems is supposed to be connected with the increasing use of devices. More and more people <<have**T2**lex_item_choice**None**8**claim or>> headaches or heart diseases <<, and**T1**Punctuation**None**3**and>> hospitals are always full of clients. This essay proves that technologies cause many health problems <<nowadays**T3**lex_item_choice**None**5**today>>. 

First of all, devices <<allow us**T4**Transitive**None**5**allow>> to stay home as much as possible. From your seat you can do shopping, learn, order food and so on. All <<these**T5**Ref_device**None**4**this>> possibilities cause the lack of moving. That is why many modern people, including children, suffer from <<obesity**T6**lex_item_choice**None**9**overweigh>>t. Your smartphone or tablet <<suppresses**T24**lex_item_choice**None**4**take>> your motivation to move, walk, do sport. However, there is a solution of this problem <<, and**T9**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<everything**T10**lex_item_choice**None**3**all>> <<depends**T11**Agreement_errors**None**6**depend>> on you. It is necessary to make yourself do easy things independently. You can use any possibility to move: go shopping, walking and so on. 

Secondly, the screens of our devices affect our vision negatively. Our eyes do not relax, they <<concentrate on**T12**Prepositions**None**11**concentrate>> small letters, pictures <<, and**T14**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<, as a result,**T13**Punctuation**None**12**as a result,>> we <<see**T15**lex_item_choice**None**5**watch>> worse <<than**T16**Spelling**None**4**that>> we <<should**T17**Modals**None**4**must>>. Specialists advise to take breaks: during your work or <<other**T18**Often_confused**None**7**another>> using of technologies it is useful to watch through the window or some things that surround you.

In addition, the use of devices often cause headaches because of the huge spread of formation. Our brain cannot <<process**T19**lex_item_choice**None**7**recycle>> al the information we receive. So it could be useful #DELETE#1#t to filter what we read, watch or listen to or to take only <<the necessary information**T21**Articles**None**21**necessary information>> that you need at the current moment. 

In conclusion, modern technologies are not something bad. We cannot decline their utility <<, however,**T22**Punctuation**None**7**however>> we should have some limits #DELETE#14#of their using. Our organs and health <<must not**T24**Inappropriate_register**None**7**mustnâ€™t>> suffer from devices.
