Nowadays, the problems of illegal pirate work <<, such as**T1**Punctuation**None**7**such as>> making copies of <<music**T3**Word_choice**None**9**musicians>> and <<film**T2**Noun_attribute**None**5**films>> products become more important from day to day. Every year new rules<< that are connected with art**T4**Defining**None**30**, that are connected with art,>> appear and become <<stricter**T5**Comparative_adj**None**11**more strict>>. As you can see, a lot of websites that showed <<films**T6**Noun_number**None**4**film>> for free or <<allowed downloading music**T33**Confusion_of_structures**None**25**allowed music to download>> are blocked or deleted.
In my opinion, it is illegal to spread copies of films and music for free, because it was someone’s work<< that must be paid for**T430**Punctuation**None**24**, that must be payed for>>. For example, <<when**T9**Conjunctions**None**2**if>> speaking about music – people want to <<listen to**T10**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> what they love, so that singers make <<records**T11**Articles**None**9**a records>> for <<sale**T432**lex_item_choice**None**4**sell>>. If you want it, you can go and buy, but, sure, there are people<< who think that it is not worth it**T12**Defining**None**36**, who think that it is not worth it,>> <<and because of this they make copies and spread them**T434**Conjunctions**None**48**because of this they make copies and spread them>>. I do not think<< that**T13**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> people who download these files should be punished, only ‘pirates’ deserve to be punished.
First of all, some discs are rare or just <<not left**T14**Negation**None**4**left>> <<in**T15**Prepositions**None**4**from>> the <<shops**T16**lex_item_choice**None**8**magazine>>, <<some even**T439**Absence_explanation**None**4**even>> cannot be sold in some regions, but demand still exists or some disks can be bought only on the <<concerts**T17**Spelling**None**7**consert>> that is far away from your home. If people cannot find legal way to get <<a disc**T33**Spelling**None**4**disk>>, ‘<<thieves**T20**Spelling**None**7**theaves>>’ allow them to download it from the <<Internet**T21**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> – <<the easiest way**T22**Articles**None**11**easiest way>> to get what you want. Yes, ‘buyers’ do not pay for it <<, and**T23**Punctuation**None**3**and>> musicians and film producers lose <<a huge amount**T24**Articles**None**11**huge amount>> of money, but in this case, people do not have another choice.
Secondly, some versions of music of films do not exist for every <<technical**T25**Suffix**None**7**technic>> firm. Sure, Apple and iTunes allow their users to do everything by rules – just click and buy, but some others  do not. For example, you have <<a Sony player**T27**Articles**None**11**Sony player>>, and you cannot legally buy music, only <<downloading**T28**Confusion_of_structures**None**8**download>> from free sites is available.
<<There is no question**T32**Absence_comp_colloc**None**12**No questions>><< that**T31**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> people<< who copy products of art**T29**Defining**None**26**, who copy products of art>> should be punished or blocked, but, moreover, if you <<look at this situation from a different perspective**T26**lex_part_choice**None**40**look at this situation from another side>><<,**T30**Punctuation**None**1**;>> producer should think about every customer, not only <<a rich one**T33**Articles**None**8**rich one>>.
