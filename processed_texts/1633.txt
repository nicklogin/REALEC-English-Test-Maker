The pie charts show the percentage of different goods and products which <<were**T2**Agreement_errors**None**3**was>> transported by rail and by road in 2008. Overall, the <<proportion**T7**Word_choice**None**6**amount>> of goods delivered by rail differs from <<that of products**T3**Ref_device**None**6**those,>> that were delivered by road.
The first obvious trend is that manufactured goods and chemicals <<take up**T14**Prepositional_verb**None**4**take>> approximately the same part <<in both**T15**Absence_explanation**None**2**in>> the pie chart representing rail statistics and in the pie chart demonstrating road statistics. Among goods <<transported**T4**Voice**None**12**transporting>> by rail, metals are the most popular <<product**T11**lex_item_choice**None**4**good>> <<, and**T16**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<they**T17**Ref_device**None**2**it>> <<make up**T5**Word_choice**None**15**considerate for>> 35%. <<On the contrary,**T6**Linking_device**None**6**While,>> food products are mostly transported by road <<in contrast to**T18**Prepositions**None**16**in contrast with>> all other products. The second trend is that machinery is transported <<six times as little by road as**T19**Numerical**None**25**sixfold less by road than>> by rail. Moreover, it is <<clear**T20**Word_choice**None**4**seen>> that non-metallic minerals account for about 11%-20% among all other goods<< transported**T9**Attr_participial**None**13**, transported>> by roads and rails.
In conclusion, almost all goods have different proportions in the pie chart, so for different kinds of products <<different kinds of delivery may be preferred**T10**Standard**None**44**may be preferred different kinds of delivery>>.
