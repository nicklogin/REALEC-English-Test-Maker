Nowadays copying and sharing films and music on the internet is a big problem. Film producers and musicians lose huge amounts of money from this illegal copies.

I agree that for film producers and musicians the problem of pirate copies is an important problem. They spend a lot of money for making a produsing the art objects, but they haven’t got a money for using it.

As for me, I can say, that we all use pirates copies of films and music in our own life. When we have not enought money to go to cinema wasthing new film, we can also do it sitting at home, by Internet.

Now our life is going around Technical equipment and Internet technologys. So we all have a lot of opportunities to share with friends all information we like. So why can’t we share films or music we like not only with our friends, but to all Internet users?

According to my opinion, people who download copied files, instead of buying the original discs, shouldn’t be punished, because Internet gives them this opportunity. As for me, i think that we can use all we can get. And why we should spend a money for things we can get free in Internet? It is not problem of people, who get pirate copies of films and music. It’s a problem of those hackers who copy and share music or films on the Internet.

So, the copying and sharing pirate files is illegal and should be punished, because it leads to losing huge amounts of money by musicians and film producers. But Internet users are not guilty that they are given a lot of free content of information and they are not responsible for problem of Internet pirating.
