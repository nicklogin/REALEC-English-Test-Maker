<<A. Orlenko**T1**DET**None**3**The>> pie charts show the percentage of different goods transported by rail and by road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008. Clearly, the percentage of goods transported by rail <<differs significantly**T188**Standard**None**21**significantly differs>> from <<that of goods**T189**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**goods>> transported by road.
As can be seen from the chart, 'metals' is <<the goods most often transported by rail**T191**Standard**None**40**the most often transported goods by rail>>, about thirty five per cent. On the contrary, 'manufactured goods' and â€˜food products' are <<the types of goods most often transported by road**T193**Standard**None**48**the most often transpored types of goods by road>>. Interestingly, transportation of 'manufactured goods' is approximately the same both by road and by rail, 28 and 25 per cent respectively. It is <<noteworthy**T196**Punctuation**None**10**noteworth,>> that transportation of 'chemicals' and 'food products' is absolutely equal by rail, about evelen per cent. What is more, transportation of 'machinery' is significantly lower by road than by rail, 2 and 12 per cent respectively.
To conclude, there is a remarkable difference between the goods' range transported by rail and by road.
