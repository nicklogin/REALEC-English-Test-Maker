As a standard of <<life**T1**Category_confusion**None**6**living>> continue to rise, new technologies develop actively. The sphere of music, cinema and media-communications <<expand**T2**lex_item_choice**None**8**increase>> every day, but there are a lot of problems <<because of**T3**Prepositions**None**2**on>> <<that**T4**Ref_device**None**2**it>>. For example, one of the most important problems is pirate copying and sharing on different social <<medias**T5**Noun_number**None**5**media>>. Because of <<that**T6**Ref_device**None**2**it>> the inventors of music and films lose a lot of money.

On the one hand, I must say that the production of music and films demands <<a lot**T7**lex_item_choice**None**10**big amount>> of things and human efforts. <<The production**T8**Articles**None**10**Production>> of media is the ability to earn money. <<Also,**T9**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> illegal copies <<influence the advertisment**T11**Transitive**None**29**influence on the advertisment>> and <<intentions**T13**lex_item_choice**None**6**wishes>> of millions <<people**T12**Spelling**None**7**peoples>> to watch the film #DELETE#13#or the cinema or listen to music #DELETE#22#in the payfull content. One of important things is the quality of films or <<the quality**T16**Articles**None**7**quality>> of <<sound**T17**Noun_number**None**6**sounds>> is very low in illegal pirate copies and people cannot imagine and feel the atmosphere of <<the film**T18**Articles**None**4**film>> or music. This is <<very**T19**Spelling**None**4**bery>> important. 

On the other hand, a lot of people <<do not**T20**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> have <<money**T21**Articles**None**7**a money>> to go to the cinema <<to watch**T22**Prepositions**None**9**for watch>> <<a new film**T23**Articles**None**8**new film>> that <<is interesting**T24**Confusion_of_structures**None**10**interested>> a lot, or buy <<a new soundtrack**T25**Articles**None**14**new soundtrack>> in App-store or Play market because it may be very expensive for <<them**T26**Pronouns**None**5**their>>. Some people <<do not**T27**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> like to go to watch films or they <<cannot**T28**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> do it because of the illness, and they practice to find pirate copies. 

<<In conclusion**T29**lex_item_choice**None**12**For conclure>>, I want to say that this <<problem**T30**Noun_number**None**8**problems>> is very <<important**T31**lex_item_choice**None**3**big>> and producers and users must find <<a compromise**T32**Articles**None**14**the compromise>> that <<allows**T33**Agreement_errors**None**5**allow>> to <<answer**T34**lex_item_choice**None**6**decide>> important questions. Media is one of important things in life of <<people**T35**lex_item_choice**None**5**human>> and it <<allows us to find**T37**Absence_comp_colloc**None**14**allows to find>> interesting information about feelings, about <<the world**T38**Articles**None**5**world>> and planet.
