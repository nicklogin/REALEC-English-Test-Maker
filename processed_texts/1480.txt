It is a well-known fact that musicians and film producers lose a lot of money every year from illegal pirate copies<<. There**T1**Punctuation**None**7**, There>> are a lot of <<arguments**T27**lex_item_choice**None**6**argues>> on this <<topic**T2**lex_item_choice**None**5**theme>>. Some people <<that**T3**Punctuation**None**6**think,>> that those who copy and <<share**T4**Coherence**None**5**those>> music and films on the <<Internet**T5**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> should be punished. But others continue copying and downloading files without thinking that it is a theft. I agree with the statement that <<it is**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> not honest and <<is illegal**T28**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**illegal>>, but I do not think that it should be punished.

Firstly, I want to say that I support musicians and producers and their work. And that is why I consider <<it is the right thing**T32**Absence_comp_sent**None**24**it to be the right thing>> to pay for their products: <<of course,**T10**Punctuation**None**9**of course>> it is a #DELETE#5#quite <<pleasant**T29**Spelling**None**7**peasant>> bonus that we are allowed to listen to music or watch films for free, but in fact it is a theft of artist’s money. They invest their money, soul, emotions and energy in their product <<, and**T11**Punctuation**None**3**and>> I think that we as the audience should pay for this.

But <<, talking about the consequences,**T14**Punctuation**None**30**talking about the consequences>> I think that punishment it is not a good way. People who download or share files should be banned, but not punished. What is more, <<in my opinon,**T15**Punctuation**None**13**in my opinion>> companies and music <<brands**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**labels>> should think about <<a better level**T16**Articles**None**12**better level>> of security <<for**T13**Prepositions**None**2**of>> their <<products**T30**lex_item_choice**None**11**information>>. Of course, there always will be people<< who**T17**Defining**None**5**, who>> will find a way to take it all for <<free**T18**Spelling**None**5**freem>> <<, but**T31**Punctuation**None**3**but>> it will be harder to do.

One more point<< that**T19**Defining**None**6**, that>> I can advice to companies is to minimize <<prices**T20**Noun_number**None**5**price>>. Maybe in that case people <<will be**T21**Tense_form**None**2**be>> more likely to buy official products. 

Downloading, copying and sharing pirate copies of music or films is not the <<worst**T23**Spelling**None**5**worth>> <<crime**T24**Category_confusion**None**8**criminal>> in the world <<, and**T22**Punctuation**None**3**and>> that is why I <<believe**T25**lex_item_choice**None**8**consider>> that <<these activities**T26**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**it>> <<do**T32**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**4**does>> not deserve a punishment.
