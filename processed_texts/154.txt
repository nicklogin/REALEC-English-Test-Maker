Youth crimes have become a very urgent problem in modern world. Young boys and girls are being frequently acquired of committing robberies, attacks or even murders nowadays. Such horryfying trend force people, especially parents, to search for reason of this phenomenon and figure out methods of dealing with it.
In my opinion, causes of this problem can vary. Firstly, parents are using easier manners of home education, Moms and dads tend to grow up their children in a free atmosphere to let them think broader and develop themselves In the society. Sometimes it can lead yougsters to take after their weakly educated peers a even criminals which ends up in their own crime involvement. Secondly, the cause of youth crimikability may become the growing poverty among families in many countries. Lack of money is able to make people become criminals to earn their living.
Nevertheless, there are many ways to cope with this problem. Spending more time with one's child and trying to understand his youth problems may be one of the solutions. Parents spend much time working nowadays and it can lead to miscommunication and misunderstanding, between parents and kids. So, it should be fixed not to let children break lawl. What is more, comprehensive psychological support especially in schools can reduce the number of crimes by solving mental problems of growing persons. Of course, youngsters with their own problems may not be able to deal with them by themselves and protest through breaking the law.
To conclude, it is necessary to mention that the problem is extremely actual and up-to date. Leaving alone the dependance of this problem from the behaviour and attitude of parents and family, it is necassary to struggle the mental reasons of such social deviations.
