The bar chart represents us the number of adult people using social networks. All in all, Facebook is the most popular network among all the adults, especially in the group of those who are between 18 and 29 years old because about 90% of them use it. Also the popularity of Facebook slightly dips depending on the age of users, but about 56% of people who are older than 65 use it ans it is more than a half of them.
Than, Instagram takes the second place and young people between 19 and 29 are again the proactivest users, but its popularity drops by 34% and it's the most unpopular network among people of 50 years old and older: the number of those who use it flactuates from 6% to 11%.
Finally, the least number of people use LinkedIn but it's quite popular among people of the middle age: about 30% of people between 30 and 64 years old use it quite often.
Inconclusion, we can see that basically the young people between 18 and 29 use social networks all the time, but Facebook, for example, is so popular that even more than a half of the oldest people like to use it.
