The graph presents the usage of three different social networks by online adults in the USA by age group.
As research shows the usage of Facebook strictly correlates with the age of users. People which are in the group 18-29 use facebook more than any other groups of users. Older categories of online adults in the USA have lower percentages.
Instagram is also more popular among the youngest adults. The middle-aged group 30-49 use it twice less than young one. Similar drop happens in next groups of 50-64 and 65+. But as chart shows Instagram is not as popular as Facebook among online adults. LinkedEn shows opposite to previous results. The highest percentage of users is located in the group of 30-49. The group 50-64 decreased by 1% in comparison with middle aged group. Equal percentages are presented by 18-29 and 65%.
Overall Facebook is the most popular social network, Instagram is popular among young group. And LinkedEn has higher demand among middle-age groups.
