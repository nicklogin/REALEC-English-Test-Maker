It's common <<acknowledgement**T1**Spelling**None**13**acknowlegment>> that nowadays a huge amount of money is spent on space flights and space exploration. However, many people argue that it is just a waste of money and time and <<governments**T2**Spelling**None**10**goverments>> should better spend it on actual problems such as protecting environment.
O<<Of course,**T3**Punctuation**None**9**Of course>>there is an enourmous number of environmental and social problems all over the world. Not all the countries have a stable economic situation, and I think that developed countries should help others if they could. Moreover, the environmental situation isn't stable too, and it's a common problem for all of us. These sums of money can be spent on searching new sources of power, saving the nature or recycling. And o<<, of course,**T4**Punctuation**None**9**of course>>many people would rather eat healthy food here on Earth than have a dangerous travel to anywhere else.
On the other hand, we should not forget that it is the main feature of human ch<<character**T5**Spelling**None**9**charakter>> mo<<moving**T7**Category_confusion**None**4**move>>orward and de<<development**T15**Category_confusion**None**8**develope>>Space exploration is the most important way in which we can do it today. People have dreamed about th#DELETE#3#e space flights since the Ancient times, and now they have the opportunity to watch the stars from spaceship board. And reaching your dream is amazing, isn't it?

Many people have sense of all their live in building spaceships and another technical equipment for space flights and they get money for it.
To conclude, I would like to say that gov<<governments**T15**Spelling**None**10**goverments>>d sponsors should find a balance in their spends between space and actual problems around them such as society and environment. They should find a balance between dream and reality. Only then the humanity can reach a harmony.
