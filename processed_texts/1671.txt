The pie charts illustrate the <<proportion**T1**Spelling**None**8**prortion>> of different goods which were <<transported**T2**Spelling**None**13**transportated>> <<via**T3**Prepositions**None**2**by>> different <<means of transport**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**methods>> between countries in Europe in the year 2008. Generally, the metals transportation mostly <<was performed**T5**Voice**None**3**was>> by rail, when food products <<were**T6**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**was>> the first in transportation by road.
As can be seen from the chart, the most popular goods which <<were transported**T8**Voice**None**11**transported>> by rail were metals <<with 35%**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**35%>> and manufactured goods <<with 25%**T10**Absence_explanation**None**3**25%>>. At the same time the quantity of food <<products**T11**Noun_number**None**7**product>> transported by road was three times higher than by rail and the most significant among goods transported by road <<with 30%**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**30%>>. The percentages of transportation <<of manufactured goods**T13**Prepositions**None**18**manufactured goods>> were approximately the same in the both kinds <<, nearly 25% and 28%,**T15**Punctuation**None**18**nearly 25% and 28%>> and had the second position in both charts. There was a <<strong**T16**Category_confusion**None**7**strengh>> correlation between the machinery transportation and the method of doing it, so machinery transportation had only 2% in the chart of goods transported by road which was a much larger in railways transportation <<with 12%**T17**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**12%>>. The charts show that the transportation of non-metallic minerals had the opposite situation and was the least in the chart of goods transported by rail.
To sum up, the proportions of metals and food products transportation were nearly the same <<, 35% and 30%,**T18**Punctuation**None**11**35% and 30%>> in different charts and had the first position in different charts. <<And**T19**Capitalisation**None**3**and>> the percents of other goods in different ways of transportation were different, besides manufactured goods.
