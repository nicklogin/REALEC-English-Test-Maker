<<Illegal**T1**Spelling**None**7**IIlegal>> coping and sharing different media files continue to be quite <<a controversial issue**T2**Articles**None**19**controversial issue>>. There is <<an extremely popular belief**T3**Articles**None**24**extremely popular belief>> that these actions <<should**T4**Spelling**None**5**sould>> be punished because of financial <<losses**T5**Spelling**None**5**loses>> of creators. I partly agree with this statement. This essay illustrates <<a different point**T6**Articles**None**15**different point>> of view on this problem.
One of the most convincing <<arguments**T7**Noun_number**None**8**argument>> in favour of <<necessity**T8**Suffix**None**11**necessarity>> of punishment for making and sharing illegal <<pirate**T331**Noun_attribute**None**7**pirates>> copies is the fact that these actions are not fair and honest. Most people are aware #DELETE#2#of that musicians and filmmakers get a huge part of profits from selling records of their songs, <<albums**T10**Spelling**None**6**alboms>>, films – results of working hard, that are expected to be paid. Therefore, it is complicated to avoid a question: why a person<< who does not pay for products in a store is a thief**T11**Defining**None**42**, who does not pay for products in a store>> is a thief, but a men<< who**T12**Defining**None**5**, who>> <<listens to**T333**Prepositional_verb**None**7**listens>> a new hit of a <<rock group**T13**Spelling**None**9**rockgroup>> at home for free is just a fan? It seems quite unfair in the <<century**T14**Spelling**None**7**centure>> of democracy.
Nevertheless, <<the initial role of music and art of creating films in lives of people is worth remembering**T339**Standard**None**100**it is worth remembering about the initial role of music and art of creating films in lives of people>>. Factually, masters work not for money, but for transferring their feelings, emotions, ideas to hearts, minds and <<souls**T341**Spelling**None**6**soules>> of spectaculars and listeners. Naturally, music, films and other <<genres**T15**Spelling**None**6**gonres>> of art were <<available to**T343**Word_choice**None**11**allowed for>> everyone who <<wanted**T345**lex_item_choice**None**6**wished>> it. It was a common pleasure independent <<of**T16**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the size of the wallet. In today’s world this law is unlikely to be followed, and it is rather <<upsetting**T347**lex_item_choice**None**5**upset>>.
Taking everything into consideration, it can be concluded that the best way to address this issue of <<pirate**T17**Noun_attribute**None**7**pirates>> copies is to find <<the middle ground**T351**Articles**None**13**golden middle>> between punishments and common wishes to <<enjoy**T351**lex_item_choice**None**4**love>> music and films.
