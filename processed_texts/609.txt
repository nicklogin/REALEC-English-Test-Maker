Food products, chemicals and non-metallic minerals have the same percentage - 11%.
The second chart is about the transportation by road.The main goods of this way of the transportation are food products (30%) and manufactured products (28%).
Non-metallic minerals, chemicals and metals have almost the same per<<percentages**T6**Countable_uncountable**None**10**percentage>>ll 11% to 16%. However, machinery has only 2% and it is the lowest number.

It seems that if a product has a bigger weight, it woul<<would be transported**T2**Tense_choice**None**15**would transport>>railway, and metals are a good example. Chemicals do not have a great percentage in both ways of the transportation as well as non-metallic minerals. It is possible that it is a normal number for this kind of goods because they are not as important as food products or manufactured products.
