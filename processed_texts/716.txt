Air travel is the fastest and in some ways the most convenient way to travel large distances. However, the topic states that it greatly contributes to air pollution and global warming. I could not agree less.
Firstly, it is very doubtful, and I believe this is a moot point, since the amount of cars in the world and f<<fusses**T1**Spelling**None**5**fuses>>they produce is i<<inadequately**T3**Spelling**None**11**inadequetly>>bigger, at least 100000 times bigger I presume, and since many of those cars are cheap, old and are being used by people in 3rd world countries, where the quality of fuel leaves a lot to be desired, I believe that there are a lot of dangers to our atmosphere aside from air travelling.
Secondly, limiting pe<<people's**T4**Possessive**None**7**peoples>>bility to travel is wr<<wrong**T5**Redundant**None**11**wrong thing>>n many aspects.
I am not even sure if this is a legal thing to do regarding international convention of human rights. Many people work hard all year just to have a sweet possibility to spend their vacation somewhere abroad.
