The usage of permitted drugs in professional <<sports**T1**Noun_number**None**5**sport>> is a very important problem in the modern world as the medicine is becoming more and more developed.
One people consider, that athlets who used <<illegal**T2**Spelling**None**7**illigal>> drugs should not be punished very strictly. They are proving that every person can make a mistake and one chance should be given to everybody. Moreover, there is not <<a very good tendency**T3**Articles**None**18**very good tendency>> in professional <<sports**T4**Noun_number**None**5**sport>>: political relationships between countries last few years have begun to effect to the <<decisions**T5**Spelling**None**9**dicisions>> in sports.
Moving to the other point of view, which says that <<athlets**T6**Spelling**None**6**athles>>, who broke the <<rules**T7**Spelling**None**6**rulles>>, should be banned from competing professionally for the rest of their life, it should #DELETE#2#be mention some points. Firstly, it is just not honest. Secondly, the person, who was able to <<behave**T9**Spelling**None**7**behaive>> not <<fair**T10**lex_item_choice**None**5**tryly>> once, could do it again. Hence, there are some examples: Ekaterina Yourieva competed in <<biathlon**T11**Spelling**None**7**biathol>> broke rules twice.
To sum up, I should underline, that this <<problem**T12**Spelling**None**7**promlem>> is very important, and I consider that an athlet who has broken rules <<once**T13**Spelling**None**4**ones>> should be banned from professional sport for the rest of his career.
