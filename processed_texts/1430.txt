Nowadays modern technologies <<are becomming**T1**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> more and more <<involved**T2**Category_confusion**None**8**invrving>> in our lives. There is an opinion <<that**T3**Linking_device**None**5**about>> the increasing number of devices can be harmful for our health. It is important to agree with <<the position**T4**Articles**None**8**position>> written above. In fact, it is impossible to imagine modern life without technologies. They affect our lives enormously. <<Unfortunately,**T34**Spelling**None**12**Unfortunatly>> this influence is not always safe for our health, but there are different ways to <<cope**T7**Spelling**None**4**come>> with these circumstances. One of the main <<problems**T8**Spelling**None**8**provlems>> according to this <<contradictory**T9**Spelling**None**13**conctraereral>> issue is <<eyesight's**T10**lex_item_choice**None**4**eyes>> spoiling. It <<happens**T11**lex_item_choice**None**7**accures>> when someone uses such devices as mobile phone, computer, laptop or smartphone every day. Naturally, human eyes <<cannot**T12**Spelling**None**8**can  not>> deal with <<the long and bright light affection**T13**Articles**None**31**long and bright light affection>>, <<although,**T14**Punctuation**None**8**although>> such workers as, for example, programmers and designers <<spend**T15**Tense_choice**None**5**spent>> all <<day**T16**Noun_number**None**4**days>> in front of computer monitors. Due to this, they all (in most cases) <<have**T17**lex_item_choice**None**4**used>> to wear glasses. Another problem is connected with physical <<activity**T18**lex_item_choice**None**10**appearance>>. Modern people (not all of them <<, of course**T19**Punctuation**None**9**of course>>) have not enough time even to go for a <<walk**T20**Spelling**None**4**wail>> and to do some sports. 

However, there is <<another point of view**T21**Articles**None**24**an another point of view>>. <<In contrast,**T22**Punctuation**None**11**In contrast>> some people think<< that**T23**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> technologies help us to be healthy. It is rather unbelievable, but it is also can be the truth. There are many technologies<< which**T24**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> reduce <<the difficulties**T25**Articles**None**12**difficulties>> with <<health**T26**Articles**None**10**the health>>. <<For example,**T27**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> fitness centers and medicine centers have an opportunity to make you a healthy person with the help of special equipment and well-prepared doctors. Overall, it is important to mention<< that**T28**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> everything depends on <<the person**T29**Articles**None**8**a person>><< who is involved in using technologies**T30**Defining**None**39**, who is involved in using technologies>>. It is obvious<< that**T31**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they can be reduced by the right <<exploitation**T32**Spelling**None**11**explutation>> of each device and by the good time management<< which**T33**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> allows <<people**T34**lex_item_choice**None**8**everyone>> to have good lives.
