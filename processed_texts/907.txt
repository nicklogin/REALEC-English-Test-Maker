Nowadays technologies <<can**T1**Spelling**None**3**con>> not <<be**T2**Spelling**None**2**he>> separated from people lives. Neither <<a little kid**T4**Articles**None**10**little kid>> nor <<an adult**T5**Articles**None**5**adult>> is able to exist comfortable without technics. Dependance of modern technologies can create some new world wide health <<problems**T6**Spelling**None**7**probles>>. <<What**T7**Spelling**None**4**Whut>> are they? How <<can those problems be solved?**T9**Interrogative**None**29**those problems can be solved?>>
Despite the fact that modern <<technologies**T50**suggestion**None**7**tehnics>> make our lives easier, they can also create <<some**T10**Spelling**None**4**sone>> serious <<health issues**T11**Spelling**None**12**healthissues>>. The first thing<< which needs to be said is**T13**Defining**None**25**, which needs to be said,>> is that the <<monitors,**T15**Punctuation**None**9**monitors;>> phones, TV's <<can**T12**Spelling**None**3**con>> harm your vision. For example, office worker's job is conneted to PC usement. <<Sometimes**T16**Spelling**None**9**Sonetimes>> they have to spend hours without rest behind the monitor. In result eyesight is getting worse. Secondly, using <<gadgets**T17**Spelling**None**7**gadsets>> more than <<it is recomended**T19**Note_structure**None**13**it recomended>> <<can**T20**Spelling**None**3**con>> <<cause**T21**Spelling**None**5**couse>> headache. It means <<that**T22**Spelling**None**4**thut>> some <<people**T23**Spelling**None**5**peope>> are not paying <<too**T24**Spelling**None**2**to>> much <<attention to**T25**Prepositional_noun**None**13**attention for>> <<the time**T26**Articles**None**4**time>> that they are <<wasting**T27**Spelling**None**8**wastiong>> for mobile phones, notebooks <<etc**T29**Redundant_comp**None**7**and exc>><<, etc.;**T47**Punctuation**None**4**etc.>> moreover, when people use <<technical appliances**T30**suggestion**None**8**technics>> too much they can get some mental problems. There are bunch of <<people who**T31**Defining**None**13**people, which>> are fully dependent on technics and they lose connection with <<the society**T32**Articles**None**7**society>>.
Solving those issues is not <<that difficult as**T33**Punctuation**None**18**that difficult, as>> it may be thought. Firstly, everyone should notice that after every wasted <<hour**T35**Spelling**None**3**our>> behind technics some physical exercise should be done. In the second place, <<chatting**T51**suggestion**None**7**chotiny>> <<on**T52**suggestion**None**2**in>> the <<Internet**T36**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> should not <<interfere in**T62**Prepositional_verb**None**9**interfere>> your social life. <<I mean,**T38**Punctuation**None**6**I mean>> do not try to raise <<chatting**T53**suggestion**None**7**chating>> higher than real conversation. Finally, the <<simplest**T54**suggestion**None**11**most simple>> advice is to <<regulate**T40**Spelling**None**8**regurite>> the time<< which**T41**Defining**None**7**, which>> can be spent <<on**T42**Prepositions**None**3**for>> tecnins. You have to find some time, for <<example**T43**Spelling**None**7**exanple>> once in a year, when you completely do not use technics.
In conclusion, <<i**T44**Capitalisation**None**1**i>> would <<like to**T45**Spelling**None**6**liketo>> say that in spite of the fact that tecnnics cause health <<problems**T46**Punctuation**None**9**problems.>> there are precedence<< when**T59**suggestion**None**6**, when>> modern <<technologies**T57**suggestion**None**11**tehnologies>> <<have helped**T60**suggestion**None**4**help>> people. <<There are such inventions as**T61**suggestion**None**2**As>> exoskeleton suit or <<car**T62**suggestion**None**3**cor>> navigator.
