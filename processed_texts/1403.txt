A lot of people consider, that <<the regular using**T3**Articles**None**13**regular using>> <<of**T2**Spelling**None**2**if>> electronic devices can cause problems with health. Usually, <<they**T4**Ref_device**None**2**it>> can be caused by the way we use <<devices**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**them>> and the amount of time, which we spend on them.

First of all, <<computer or telephone screen light**T7**Articles**None**47**the light of the computer and  telephone screen>> <<hurts**T9**Tense_choice**None**8**are hurt>> people’s <<eyesight**T10**Spelling**None**9**eye sight>>. A lot of people use mobile phones #DELETE#14#and smartphone everyday and everywhere, including the time before sleeping. Preparing for seeping is <<a very important process**T12**Articles**None**22**very important process>>, because all this time our body (including eyes) <<relaxes**T14**Spelling**None**6**relaxs>>. However, using the phone before going to bed makes our <<eyes**T15**Spelling**None**3**eys>> work, which can cause the decreasing of <<our**T16**Ref_device**None**3**the>> <<eyesight**T17**Spelling**None**9**eye-sight>>. In addition, it can cause problems with sleeping, due to the fact, that our brain <<cannnot**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> relax too. This problem can be solved by making some <<exercises**T19**Spelling**None**9**exercizes>> for eyes every hour <<when**T20**Conjunctions**None**5**after>> using smartphone or computer. Also, people should reduce time, which is <<on**T21**Prepositional_verb**None**9**spent for>> devices.

The second problem can be caused by the <<wrong sitting position**T22**Absence_explanation**None**14**wrong position>> in front of a computer. Nowadays, people tend to <<spend**T23**Spelling**None**5**spent>> every day at work <<in**T25**Prepositions**None**10**sitting on>> <<a computer chair**T24**Articles**None**18**the computer chair>>. <<Almost**T26**Spelling**None**7**Almoust>> <<everyone**T28**Ref_device**None**9**everybody>> <<cannot**T27**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> choose the right position to <<seat in**T29**Prepositions**None**10**seat on it>>, which causes problems with <<spine**T31**Articles**None**9**the spine>>. Hopefully, this problem can be solved by physical <<exercises**T32**Spelling**None**9**exercizes>>. People should do them #DELETE#5#after every 45 minutes being in front of the computer screen #DELETE#13#or in the gym.

All in all, despite the benefits of modern <<technologies**T35**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>, people should think about their health. These problems can be reduced by replacing the light screens to alternative type of getting information as <<books**T36**Noun_number**None**4**book>> or <<newspapers**T37**Noun_number**None**9**newspaper>>.
