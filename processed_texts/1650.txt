There is no doubt that using a lot of modern technology in our daily <<routine**T2**Spelling**None**7**routing>>  can lead to irreversible consequences such as problems with <<health**T3**Countable_uncountable**None**7**healths>>. This essay will analyse the <<principle**T19**Often_confused**None**9**principal>> problem of using <<gadgets**T5**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>> everywhere in our life and offer a solution to this <<problem**T38**Word_choice**None**5**issue>>.
A number of key issues arise from the statement. One of the most striking <<features**T8**Noun_number**None**7**feature>> of this problem is that due to modern technologies our life <<has become**T39**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> <<convenient**T4**Spelling**None**9**conviniet>>: many people cannot reject these items even if <<gadgets**T32**Noun_number**None**6**gadjet>> are harmful because #DELETE#2#as without them they will <<devote**T10**Word_choice**None**5**spend>> a lot of time <<on**T11**Prepositions**None**3**for>> their <<chores**T40**Word_choice**None**6**duties>>, for a example. The second aspect of this problem is that many young people are addicted to modern technologies: Iphones, Ipads, <<Macbooks**T24**Noun_number**None**7**Macbook>>, since they have social networks there<<,**T41**Punctuation**Dependent_change**1**.>> <<where**T42**Capitalisation**Dependent_change**5**Where>> they can communicate with their friends. Teenagers do not care that using a lot of <<gadgets**T13**Ref_device**None**4**them>> <<causes**T14**Tense_choice**None**6**caused>> a lot of problems with eyes.
What is needed to improve the situation with widespread <<use**T43**Category_confusion**None**5**using>> of <<gadgets**T15**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>> is <<a certain effort**T45**Articles**None**14**certain effort>> <<to avoid them, which should be encouraged and promoted**T34**Standard**None**67**, which should be encouraged and promoted by means of to avoid them>>. Young people <<should spend**T36**Modals**None**9**can spent>> more time with <<their**T21**Spelling**None**5**treir>> parents or friends, <<read**T17**Lack_par_constr**None**7**to read>> books, <<develop**T18**Lack_par_constr**None**10**to develop>> #DELETE#5#their different skills instead of using modern technologies. What is more, #DELETE#5#there can be different limits of <<using devices**T22**Absence_explanation**None**5**using>>.
From <<these**T23**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> facts, one may <<conclude**T25**Spelling**None**6**cloced>> that it is very hard to avoid <<using gadgets**T27**Ref_device**None**2**it>>#DELETE#1#. since <<life**T26**Articles**None**8**the life>> <<goes**T28**Tense_form**None**5**is go>> on. And the impact of <<modern technologies**T31**Ref_device**None**4**them>> is <<significant**T32**Word_choice**None**3**big>>.
