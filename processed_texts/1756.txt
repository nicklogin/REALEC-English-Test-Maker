In our modern sport field it is a widespread <<tendency**T1**Spelling**None**9**tendenton>> <<of**T2**Prepositions**None**2**to>> using illegal drugs before the competition. Some people believe that <<athletes**T3**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> who <<were**T4**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**was>> identified as taking <<drugs**T6**lex_item_choice**None**7**dopping>> should <<be banned**T7**Voice**None**3**ban>> from competing for a period. However, others say that such <<athletes**T8**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> <<who break the rools**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**15**break the rools>> and they should be banned from training at all to the end <<of the life**T11**Prepositions**None**8**the life>>.
In my opinion, one unnormal step such as taking drugs is not a point to take him or her away from competition for the long period of time. Firstly, such <<behaviour**T12**Spelling**None**10**beheaviour>> might be connected with the <<will**T13**Suffix**None**10**willingnes>> of <<being**T14**Category_confusion**None**2**be>> the winner of the one competition. Sportsmen train all their life to have the first place at world competition or in the Olympic Games, for example and taking drugs for such <<athlete**T15**Spelling**None**6**athlet>> is not a repeated <<tendency**T16**Spelling**None**11**tendendensy>>, but the only not right step.
Secondly, the <<athlete**T17**Spelling**None**6**athlet>> might be against such methods, but the coach, for example, might pressure on the sporsman to take additional tablet. <<Drug**T18**lex_item_choice**None**7**Dopping>> is not always the <<decision**T19**Spelling**None**8**desision>> of <<athlete**T20**Spelling**None**6**athlet>> and this case should be included in the punishment.
<<Nevertheless,**T21**Punctuation**None**12**Nevertheless>> other people argue that if person take the wrong way first time <<there would be**T22**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**would be>> #DELETE#3#and the second time. Such people believe that in competition there is always a big temptation to <<break**T24**Spelling**None**6**breake>> the <<rules**T25**Spelling**None**5**rools>> and if sportsman <<does**T26**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**do>> it, he or she must go out <<of**T28**Prepositions**None**4**from>> the sport.
I have to disagree with that idea and say that taking drugs by <<athlete**T29**Spelling**None**6**athlet>> may be a <<necessary**T30**Spelling**None**9**nessesary>> step because of the health condition. In professional <<sports**T31**Noun_number**None**5**sport>> it is not an exeption that <<athletes**T32**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> <<break**T33**Tense_choice**None**5**broke>> legs or arms and they must #DELETE#2#to train despite the pain. Only helpful and important medical tablet could be presented too district commision as a <<drug**T35**lex_item_choice**None**7**dopping>>.
To sum up, I would like to say that the situations and conditions when sportsmen decide to take drugs to win competition or to be just stronger are very different. And it is important to give people a chance not to <<lose**T36**Spelling**None**5**loose>> the profession.
