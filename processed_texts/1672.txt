It is <<evident**T1**Category_confusion**None**8**evidence>> that issues related to <<the expansion**T2**Category_confusion**None**9**expanding>> of using modern technologies are important. Scientists maintain that if modern technologies become more popular, it will <<cause**T3**Transitive**None**8**cause to>> the <<increase**T54**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**4**rise>> <<in**T41**Prepositions**Dependent_change**2**of>> health problems. They <<illustrate**T5**Agreement_errors**None**11**illustrates>> a <<variety**T6**Spelling**None**6**varity>> of problems, but we will discuss only some of them. 
The most important problem is that modern children have <<weak health**T7**Articles**None**13**a weak health>> because of sitting at #DELETE#5#their home and not doing anything in <<the open air**T42**lex_part_choice**None**9**clean air>>. For example, they can study at #DELETE#5#their home <<by taking**T55**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**by>> online <<course**T10**Spelling**None**7**coursec>>, <<buy**T47**Lack_par_constr**None**6**to buy>> food and goods <<on**T11**Prepositions**None**2**by>> the Internet, to take part in different <<activities online**T4**Absence_explanation**None**8**evidence>>. Moreover, modern <<technology's**T43**Spelling**None**12**technologyes>> <<impact**T13**Transitive**None**9**impact on>> <<people's**T35**Articles**None**12**the people's>> <<psyche**T36**lex_item_choice**None**17**psychology system>>. People become <<addicted to**T16**Prepositional_adjective**None**11**addicted by>> their phones, computers, games like <<to drugs**T17**Lack_par_constr**None**7**a drugs>> and <<cannot understand**T18**Modals**None**20**cannot to understand>> <<if something is real or not**T19**Confusion_of_structures**None**19**what is real or not>>. It <<leads to the fact**T22**lex_item_choice**None**6**caused>> that <<people**T34**Articles**None**10**the people>> can kill themselves or other people<< thinking that it is a fantasy game**T14**Attr_participial**None**36**, thinking that it is a fantasy game>>. Futhermore, it is significant that today people have more <<problems**T21**Spelling**None**9**problem s>> with their eyes and #DELETE#4#with other important organs because they always <<sit**T15**Spelling**None**4**site>> near <<different computers**T38**Articles**None**23**the different computers>> or <<radioactive**T24**Spelling**None**7**radiote>> <<instruments**T32**Noun_number**None**10**instrument>> and do not do any physical exercises to improve their abilities. Modern technologies do everything for people and do not give opportunities to develop and <<strengthen**T4**Category_confusion**None**7**strengh>> their health.
In my opinion, the main <<solution to**T4**Prepositional_noun**None**8**solve of>> <<these**T28**Agreement_errors**None**13**this problems>> is #DELETE#9#that only teaching children and our new generation that modern technology should be <<used**T12**Tense_form**None**3**use>> <<in moderation**T61**Word_choice**None**9**limitedly>> and not everywhere <<: this will help to reduce the problems with health**T62**Absence_comp_sent**None**44**will help to reduce the problems with health>>. Moreover, <<scientists**T31**Spelling**None**10**sciencists>> can solve these problems themselves if they <<find**T23**Tense_choice**None**9**will find>> new drugs<< which**T49**Defining**None**7**, which>> will <<strengthen**T50**Spelling**None**9**strenghen>> people's nervous system, health <<, and**T51**Punctuation**None**3**and>> physical <<abilities.**T52**Punctuation**None**9**abilities>>
To sum up, scientists create modern technologies, so they should help #DELETE#2#to <<the nation**T29**Articles**None**6**nation>> to reduce the number of problems#DELETE#1#, <<by using different ways of teaching**T30**Absence_comp_sent**None**32**using different ways of teaching>> or creating something new.
