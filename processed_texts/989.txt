Musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year from illegal pirate copies Copying and sharing music or films on the Internet is theft and people who download these files, instead of buying the original discs, should be punished.

Show buisness is the most popular and expensive product in the world. They spend and earn billions of dollars every year. All of the word like listen the music and whatching films. It is a part of our relaxing.

Nowaday going to concerts or even whatching films in the cinema is became expensive.

So have we problem with copying and sharing music or films instead of buying?

On the one hand it is criminal becouse there is copyrights. If we compare Russia and Europe we can make conclusion that in Europe noone will try to make illegal copies becouse they know that can be punished. And in Russia copying and sharing music or films is very popular becouse our VPN and Internet controler didn’t block the sites which have illegal and free films or music.

On the other hand musicians and film producers earn a lot of money and if everyone in the world will buy their music or film, including that they would can buy a part of our world/

In conclusion all musicians and film producers should make their products’ prices cheaper if they want to decide the problem with illegal pirate copies. And I think that price should be different. It depends in what country you live.

Because all of people like music and whatching films but not all of them have enough money to buy it. Opportunities in different countries and families are not the same. So if people can buy every month new original films and musics they will do it.

So making price cheaper and also make control in the Internet stronger will decide the issue and musicians and film producers wont lose huge amount of money every year.
