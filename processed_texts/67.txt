Nowadays listening to music and watching films from websites are very popular. But music and films often exist there illegally <<uploaded by**T5**Absence_explanation**None**10**because of>> <<hackers or web-pirates who steal them from official web-sites of musicians and film producers**T8**Defining**None**88**hackers or web-pirates steal them from official websites of musicians and film producers>>. It is done <<to get**T1**Infinitive_constr**None**11**for getting>> benefits and <<it cuts**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**cuts>> owner’s profits. There are laws about <<right to protect private property**T13**Absence_explanation**None**26**private rights of property>> in many countries. <<Pirates**T14**Spelling**None**6**Pirats>> <<should always be**T2**Modals**None**14**are not always>> punished or <<prosecuted**T77**lex_item_choice**None**7**pursued>> #DELETE#3#and <<; moreover,**T15**Punctuation**None**8**moreover>> people downloading these files should get punishment too.
<<Some people agree**T18**Confusion_of_structures**None**16**It can be agreed>> with the statement about <<the necessity of**T9**lex_item_choice**None**7**getting>> punishment <<for both**T16**Standard**None**8**both for>> hackers and people using <<pirate**T22**Category_confusion**None**7**pirat’s>> copies. First of all, using <<the materials of theft**T17**Articles**None**18**materials of theft>> is the same #DELETE#7#support as making theft <<come**T3**Tense_form**None**5**comes>> true. So, people should be punished for these acts as helpers <<in**T6**Prepositions**None**3**for>> crimes. <<Besides**T26**Category_confusion**None**6**Beside>> this, people often don’t want to buy expensive <<legally available**T84**Absence_explanation**None**5**legal>> discs and films <<, and**T27**Punctuation**None**3**and>> that is why they download <<pirate**T28**Category_confusion**None**7**pirat’s>> versions #DELETE#52#because of a special aim not to spend a lot of money <<of**T30**Prepositions**None**3**for>> these media products. Moreover, there is <<a tendency**T87**Articles**None**4**tend>> to <<share musical products**T33**Transitive**None**25**share of musical products>> <<on**T40**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet with friends and relatives. It means <<using**T88**lex_item_choice**None**8**spending>> #DELETE#2#of <<the objects of theft**T89**Articles**None**16**objects of theft>>. It <<, of course,**T36**Punctuation**None**10**of course,>> can be <<prosecuted**T91**lex_item_choice**None**7**pursued>> #DELETE#23#for judiciary by courts.
<<On the other hand**T38**Linking_device**None**29**On the other side of the coin>>, <<some can dispute**T87**Word_choice**None**24**it can be disagreed with>> the <<need**T41**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**9**statement>> <<to prosecute**T87**lex_item_choice**None**12**to persecute>> <<people who download media products illegally**T87**Absence_explanation**None**18**downloading people>>. The first argument for their support is that <<in fact they**T48**Standard**None**12**they in fact>> <<may**T4**Modals**None**5**could>> not know about the origin of a concrete film or music track. <<In most cases**T87**lex_part_choice**None**14**In most cases,>> it <<refers to**T51**lex_item_choice**None**8**is about>> old people who <<like listening to music**T52**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**20**like listen to music>> or <<watching**T53**Lack_par_constr**None**5**watch>> interesting films. They <<might not have**T54**Modals**None**17**might not to have>> enough <<knowledge**T55**Countable_uncountable**None**10**knowledges>> <<about**T58**Prepositions**None**3**for>> using <<the Internet**T56**Articles**None**8**Internet>> because a computer sphere changes fast actually. So, this <<case**T59**lex_item_choice**None**4**idea>> should <<include**T60**lex_item_choice**None**12**connect with>> children too. They are very <<immature**T66**lex_item_choice**None**5**small>>, they can download <<files**T61**Spelling**None**4**fils>> a<<without thinking**T62**Word_choice**None**15**nd not to think>> about <<consequences**T63**Spelling**None**12**consequances>>. The second <<reason**T64**lex_item_choice**None**8**argument>> for disagreement is <<taking into consideration**T23**lex_part_choice**None**19**taking to attension>> #DELETE#14#the fact about who <<has really stolen the material**T25**Absence_explanation**None**13**really stolen>>. It <<means that**T68**Linking_device**None**6**means,>> people need to <<look for**T65**Prepositional_verb**None**7**look at>> the #DELETE#9#essential real crime, not <<for cases of**T70**Absence_explanation**None**2**to>> sharing music and <<films**T67**Noun_number**None**4**film>>.
<<In conclusion,**T72**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I want to say that, <<of course**T73**Spelling**None**10**of courses>>, all <<criminals**T74**lex_item_choice**None**12**crime-makers>> should be punished <<, especially**T75**Punctuation**None**10**especially>> <<now**T76**Spelling**None**3**how>> #DELETE#12#in situation that <<pirate**T78**Category_confusion**None**7**pirat’s>> copies <<are spread worldwide**T79**Word_choice**None**16**are world-spread>>. But we need to remember that <<if we judge almost everybody,**T81**Punctuation**None**41**if we prosecuteprosecute almost everybody>> it can be finished <<with**T80**Prepositions**None**2**by>> <<missing**T47**lex_item_choice**None**24**exception from attention>> <<unnormal**T87**Suffix**None**9**unnormous>>, irrational cases.
