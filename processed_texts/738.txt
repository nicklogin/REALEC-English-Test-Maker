It is undoubtedly that With modern pace of life a lot of young people commit crimes, there are a lof of reasons why they do so. In this essay, I will state the major problems and give solutions.
One of the firstproblems of this development is the upbringing. Parents often do not pay enough attention to their children. They might be busy with work or with some other things. So, parents do not educate their children and do not tell them how they need to behave. Consequently, these children, start lying, stealing and even killing people. Thus, parents should teach their children to distinguish what is good and what is bad. For instance, they could buy them instructive books, and give them real examples of good behaviour. This would help to prevent youngsters comitting crimes.
Another major problem is the influence of media and social networks. Lots of teenagers spend a lot of time using social networks. They might watch there some short videos, or agressive movies. Which show that there is nothing bad to gang up on someone. Moreover, they show that to become successful and rich it is necessary to bluff. For example, there is a famous film which is called wolfs from Wall- Street where the major character is a swindler who woul anything to achieve his goals. In my opinion, such films should be restricted by government for people under the age of 21. Moreover, to solve this problem teachers at schools should show students films about friendship, love and honesty. Because that what makes a person successful.
In conclusion, I would like to add, that a person who wants to commit a crime would do that, no matter what. Nevertheless, each of us can prevent from that happening. It is important to show good deeds to children from their childhood.So that they grow up as decent people.
