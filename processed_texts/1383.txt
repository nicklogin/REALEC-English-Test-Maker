The pie charts illustrate the <<percentages**T1**Noun_number**None**10**percentage>> of different materials transported by trains and vehicles between European countries 9 years ago.

As it can be seen, <<the transportation**T2**Articles**None**14**transportation>> of metals differs significantly. <<There**T5**Ref_device**None**2**It>> had been transported 35 <<per cent**T3**Spelling**None**9**per cents>> of goods by rail in comparison with 11 <<per cent**T4**Spelling**None**9**per cents>> by road. Consequently, it influenced the <<proportion**T6**lex_item_choice**None**10**percentage>> of food products that replaced most of previous material <<spots**T7**Noun_number**None**4**spot>>, so <<there**T8**Ref_device**None**4**here>> is a gap in 19 <<per cent**T9**Spelling**None**9**per cents>>.

Nevertheless, there are <<materials**T10**Noun_number**None**8**material>> that have approximately the same <<percentages**T11**Noun_number**None**10**percentage>> in <<the transportation**T12**Articles**None**14**transportation>> by both ways. For instance, chemicals and manufactured goods #DELETE#4#that have gaps in 5 and 3 <<per cent**T14**Spelling**None**9**per cents>> respectively. Moreover, such #DELETE#7#kind of good as machinery also has a difference in <<proportions**T16**lex_item_choice**None**10**percentage>>. It was transported by train in 10 <<per cent**T17**Spelling**None**9**per cents>> more than by car. In comparison, non-metallic minerals have almost the same <<percentages**T18**Noun_number**None**10**percentage>> <<, but**T19**Punctuation**None**3**but>> in another order.

To conclude, some of materials <<are**T20**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> easier to transport by rail, like metals. However, food products need special conditions, so it is frequently transported by vehicles.
