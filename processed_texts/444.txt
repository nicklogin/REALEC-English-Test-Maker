It is not a secret that today an enormous number of crimes are <<committed**T1**Derivation**None**8**commited>>. What is more, mostly young people commit them, though this situation <<did not**T16**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn't>> <<take place**T15**lex_part_choice**None**10**have place>> in the past. So, what are the causes of this situation and what can people do to solve such a problem?

In my opinion, all the problems begin in<<in childhood**T17**Articles**None**16**in the childhood>>Nowadays children watch TV a lot. And there is no<<no strong censorship**T5**Countable_uncountable**None**23**not a strong censorship>>so la<<a large amount of**T7**Articles**None**12**large amount>>f films co<<contains**T6**Tense_form**None**7**contain>>h<<scenes**T8**Articles**None**10**the scenes>>f violence. Th<<There is the same situation**T18**Absence_comp_sent**None**21**The same situation is>>ith computer games. Children spend most of their time in front of th<<computers**T19**Articles**None**13**the computers>>laying computer ga<<games; in many cases,**T10**Punctuation**None**20**games, in many cases>>ecause they do not have an<<another way**T20**Noun_number**None**12**another ways>>o entertain themselves. And practically every game is about wa<<wars**T11**Noun_number**Parallel_construction**3**war>>fights or just also containes a lot of violent scenes. All these things can influence a child, make him repeat the actions he notices.
Well, the first solution to this problem is to imp<<develop**T21**lex_item_choice**None**7**improve>>e censorship, so <<so that**T13**Linking_device**None**5**so to>>ly good and useful films and computer gam<<games will be**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**games be>>ailable for children.It can help to make them see good act<<deeds**T22**lex_item_choice**None**7**actions>>d repeat them in their lives or to improve their logic. However, modern children and teenagers can easily break the rules and find some ways to get rid of them.

What is more, it it significant to do many activities which<<with**T23**Word_choice**None**5**which>>dren from their birth, do not leave their<<them**T24**Pronouns**None**5**their>>e on their own. Then they will not be able to waste time in front of the c<<computers**T14**Articles**None**13**the computers>>TV. This solution will also be helpful in attempts to make a child be interested in different spheres of life. But, of course, sometimes parents cannot find enough time for their children.
And also, an essential solution to this problem is to help a child to find his hobby. It will let him be surrounded with his favourite things, avoid bad influence, not waste their <<his**T3**Ref_device**Parallel_construction**5**their>>for some unnecessary things.
To sum up, I strongly believe that the number of crimes committed by young people can be reduced, their parents just have to pay attention to their children since they are born.
