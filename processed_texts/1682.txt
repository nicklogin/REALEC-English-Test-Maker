Nowadays, the problem with doping became really widespread in many kinds of sport. Some people proclaimed that punishment for using illegal drugs needs to be very serious, but in contrast others strongly believe that athletes must be responsible for their crime only for a small limited period. In my <<opinion**T292**Spelling**None**8**oppinion>>, international sport <<association**T293**Spelling**None**11**assosiation>> should classify crimes related to using illegal drugs and make <<decision**T294**Spelling**None**8**desicion>> due to a big number of different factors, as: reputation of one particular sportsman, type of drug, and many others.
<<Concerning**T295**Spelling**None**10**Conserning>> to the point of view <<closely**T296**Spelling**None**6**closly>> linked with the statement that punishment for <<described**T297**Spelling**None**9**discribed>> crimes must be <<banned**T298**Voice**None**7**banning>> from competing professionally during the period of whole life. I can say that proponents of this idea <<base**T299**Voice**None**5**based>> on the princip of fair play. They allege that such <<a way**T300**Articles**None**3**way>> will help to regulate honest organising of competition and trust "clear" athletes.
As opposed to this point of view, some people <<convince**T301**Spelling**None**9**convience>> on the idea that each person is able to make a mistake, so he must have an opportunity to begin his professional <<career**T302**Spelling**None**6**careir>> from the <<beginning**T303**Spelling**None**9**beggining>>. In this case, they assume that a limited period will be enough for <<athlete**T304**Spelling**None**6**athlet>> to change his mind (for instanse, 2 or 3 years).
Personally, I reckon that there are some comprehensive approaches in considering this problem. We must diversify small commitments from serious crimes.
Taking everything into consideration, I tend to note a significant <<subjects**T305**Spelling**None**8**sugjects>>. First of all, punishment for using illegal drugs is really debatable theme. Moreover, modern sport legislation <<needs**T306**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> to be improved and overseen.
