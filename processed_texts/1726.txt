<<In recent years,**T17**Punctuation**None**15**In recent years>> the problem of using <<illegal drugs**T16**Articles**None**17**the illegal drugs>> by athletes has became burning. There are different <<opinions**T8**Noun_number**None**7**opinion>> about the measures for this. This essay will discuss these opinions and make a certain conclusion.
To begin with, some people argue that <<if an athlete uses any illegal drug,**T11**Punctuation**None**35**if an athlete uses any illegal drug>> he must be banned from competition only for a period of several years. Indeed, it might be a viable solution, because <<everyone**T12**Compound_word**None**9**every one>> has the right to make a mistake, so if the athlete has <<time**T14**Countable_uncountable**None**6**a time>>, he will understand that he was wrong at his desicion and then he will train more and more to avoid the using of such drugs in the following competition. The obvious advantage of this solution is that the sportsman should not stop his career, which might be the central part of his life.
From the other side, there is an opinion that the athletes <<who used**T13**Linking_device**None**4**used>> illegal drugs must be banned from the professional sport forever. It <<cannot be denied**T15**Voice**None**11**has no deny>> that such decision may be rather strict and cruel, but I can definitely agree with it. Sport is not just about always being first; it teaches to strive some strict moral codex and being <<honest**T22**Category_confusion**None**6**honour>> with yourself. It is easiest way to use drugs to improve your skills for a period, but it also shows <<moral weakness**T19**Articles**None**17**the soul weakness>>. <<In this case,**T21**Punctuation**None**12**In this case>> how can such person call himself a <<true**T20**Category_confusion**None**5**truly>> <<sportsman**T5**Noun_number**None**9**sportsmen>>?
Despite there being a lot of debates about the opportunity of using any drugs in order to increase sport skills, sportsmen should stay <<careful**T4**Derivation**None**8**carefull>>, because such measures might destroy their health. It is true for any kind of drugs: legal or illegal. As for the latter, I strongly believe that its using by professional sportsmen is <<the worst**T3**Superlative_adj**None**9**the worse>> way to gain success. That is why it might be necessary to <<ban**T1**Voice**None**6**banned>> such sportsmen from competing not only for 2 or 3 years, but for the rest of <<their life**T22**Ref_device**None**4**life>>.
