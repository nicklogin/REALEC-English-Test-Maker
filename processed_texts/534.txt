Crime is a common thing nowadays. People's homes are robbed, many women get mugged. These kinds of things <<certainly do not happen**T307**Tense_choice**None**27**are certainly not happening>> without a cause. Economical <<crises**T309**Noun_number**None**8**crisises>>, wars, <<political**T2**Spelling**None**8**politcal>> conflicts. All of them make people turn into criminals, even the youngest ones. The crime rates amongst young adults <<are**T311**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> getting higher and higher <<every**T313**lex_item_choice**None**4**each>> single day. But why does it happen?

Well, one good reason for that is certainly different types of conflicts or happenings, which affect people on a global scale. If we remeber the fall of the Soviet Union for instance, we can certainly recall a lot of stories about different gangs and no<<notorious**T315**Spelling**None**8**notorius>>riminals, wh<<who**T317**Conjunctions**None**5**which>>avaged the country. Back then It<<it**T6**Capitalisation**None**2**It>>as hard to su<<earn one's living**T319**Word_choice**None**16**support yourself>>nd crime was the only way out even for teenagers. Secondly, It<<it**T7**Capitalisation**None**2**It>>an certainly be different psychological factors such as peer pressure. Youngsters can be certainly persuaded to take part in criminal activity If<<if**T5**Capitalisation**None**2**If>>he offer is alluring.

All the information above sounds horrible, but what can we do about this? There's no precise answer out there,because every young man or woman has his or hers reasons for commiting crimes. The only good thing that parents and teachers can do, is<< is**T4**Punctuation**None**4**, is>>cultivate strong will in then<<them**T321**Spelling**None**4**then>> try to teach them critical thinking, so they would understand how doing "bad" things may affect the society and the country they are living in. But even my methods are a topic for <<of**T323**Prepositions**None**3**for>>ery huge debate. Times change and people too, so It's<<it's**T3**Capitalisation**None**4**It's>>d to tell if there will ever be a perfect solution.
