A large number of people worldwide would rather watch British or American movies instead of watching films produced by their local country companies.
There are several reasons for that. First, English language has become t<<global language**T1**Articles**None**19**the global language>> making movies produced by the UK and the USA t<<the most popular ones**T2**Absence_comp_sent**None**16**the most popular>> Secondly, movies shot in these two countries usually have b<<influental**T3**lex_item_choice**None**3**big>>investors, therefore making it possible to produce better quality pictures to attract the lovers of good movies. Thirdly, some of the local producers are not known outside of the area where they work, so people don't think it will later be possible for them to keep a conversation or discussion on the topic of cinema with someone from other country.
Governments all over the world have always invested money to produce films that would reflect certain ideology. In my opinion, it's right that authorities support producers monetary, but they shouldn't tell them what to shoot and what topic should the movie have. First of all, by giving money away government inspires young producers to come up with the idea of a movie that later might become popular. Second of all, as we have seen in Russia with the few governmentally supported films, movies that get funding from the state normally draw bigger attention. Lastly, movies as a form of art ha<<have**T4**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**has>>lways been used to document certain cultural differences that people have in particular country and that is why it is essential that goverment spends money on making note of these traits of character or historical events that are relevant to local community.
Overall, I think that it is correct for governments to support financially local film producers, as it will make an alternative for British and the US movies that nowadays are too overrated. I should also point out the fact that today there are not enough quality films in Russian cinemas and local industries will benefit from having more money because it creates more jobs and requires getting good education.
