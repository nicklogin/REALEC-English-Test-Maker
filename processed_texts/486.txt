It is well known that film indusrtry is a very important part of the culture of the country. A lot of people watch films to relax or to get new knowledge. Many of them watch British or American films <<more than**T12**Redundant_comp**None**15**more othen than>> <<those**T13**Ref_device**None**6**others>> which are produced in their own countries. It is interesting to understand the reasons of this common choice and to try to think if <<the government**T2**Articles**None**9**goverment>> should change the situation.

There are many reasons for such a high level of po<<the popularity**T4**Articles**None**10**popularity>>h<<which**T3**Defining**None**4**what>>ritish or American films have. To begin with, these countries started this kind of industry many years ago and created some traditions of making films, which others have to copy. In addition, the UK and USA are the richest countries all over the world, and they could afford some special effects in their movies, which is one of the main factors for some people. Moreover, the most ta<<talented**T1**Spelling**None**8**talanted>>ctors want to join American or British films because of the largest sum of money given there. Thus, it is also a financial problem.

There could be different points of view if locally produced films should be supported. As for me, I agree with the idea that gove<<the government**T5**Articles**None**10**government>>uld give the aid to directors to i<<in order to**T6**Conjunctions**None**2**to>>rove their movie business. Firstly, local film production could help<<help the**T7**Spelling**None**7**helpthe>>ntry to show its cultural features and therefore share them with the others. Secondly, thes<<this**T14**Agreement_errors**None**5**these>>wth of film production would help people to respect their own country. Thirdly, some tral<<talented**T8**Spelling**None**9**tralanted>>al directors could become competitors for their coll<<colleagues**T9**Spelling**None**9**collegues>>Great Britain or America, and they would have to create their films better. Thereby, the common level of film quality would be higher.

To conclude, I would like to say that the question of local movie is still open. I think that local directors should finant<<be financially supported**T11**Voice**None**21**financially supported>>e government to shift American or British popularity.
