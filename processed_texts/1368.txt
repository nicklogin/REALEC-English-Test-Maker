In our modern life people have a lot of <<problems**T1**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> with health #DELETE#12#and wellness. Our world <<has become**T3**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> too fast and people waste their time mostly on <<a**T4**Articles**None**3**job>>, career and family, and forget about <<themselves**T5**Spelling**None**10**themselvse>>. 

I think <<that**T6**Ref_device**None**5**there>> is a problem number one. I <<guess**T7**Spelling**None**5**guese>> that <<the most popular**T8**Articles**None**12**most popular>> health problem is <<depression**T9**Articles**None**14**the depression>> (or SAD) and <<people**T11**lex_item_choice**None**8**humanity>> <<do not**T10**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> know how they have to fight with this problem. For example, my mom <<is in**T12**lex_item_choice**None**3**has>> <<depression**T13**Articles**None**12**a depression>> because she works a lot and <<when she comes home,**T14**Punctuation**None**19**when she comes home>> she starts doing a routine house work. She <<forgets**T15**Agreement_errors**None**6**forget>> about the rest. <<It is**T16**Inappropriate_register**None**4**It’s>> very important <<not to**T17**Negation**None**5**don’t>> forget about it. She is a <<breadwinner**T18**Spelling**None**11**breddwinner>> in my family and this is why she has such health problem <<as**T19**Prepositions**None**4**like>> depression#DELETE#35#, some other sickness with her head.

I think this problem might be solved if people start thinking about <<themselves**T21**lex_item_choice**None**8**yourself>> and about their feelings and body. Maybe <<the solution**T22**Absence_explanation**None**2**it>> is a meditation, or <<a hobby**T23**Articles**None**5**hobby>>. Something that can keep you in your mind. I guess that people mostly have <<psychosomatic problems**T25**Articles**None**23**a psychosomatic problem>> with health <<nowadays**T26**lex_item_choice**None**19**in our modern world>>. Or they just <<cannot**T27**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> find time for the rest or going to the doctor.

All in all, I want to say that people have to believe in <<themselves**T28**lex_item_choice**None**8**yourself>>, take care about <<themselves**T29**lex_item_choice**None**8**yourself>> and maybe <<it**T30**Ref_device**None**8**this way>> will help us to reduce this problem #DELETE#11#with health. We have to help each other. Maybe it sounds crazy <<, but**T33**Punctuation**None**3**but>> some people believe in karma, and that the bad thing goes away if you <<do not**T32**lex_item_choice**None**5**can’t>> do <<bad things**T37**Articles**None**14**the bad things>>. Maybe they are right. <<Maybe,**T38**Punctuation**None**5**Maybe>> if people <<will be**T40**Tense_choice**None**4**were>> more open to each other and take care about <<themselves**T39**lex_item_choice**None**8**yourself>> and about each other, this health problem will be <<gone**T32**lex_item_choice**None**7**reduced>>.
