There is an opinion that downloading free music and movies is illegal and should be <<considered a crime**T2**Verb_pattern**None**21**considered as a crime>> and punished as well. The sanctions should be levied on the person copying material which is the ownership of a company or other individuals <<, and**T1**Punctuation**None**3**and>> such cases should be brought to court.
One of the reasons for that is that pirate copying eliminates the profit of producers of such goods. The idea is the following: every product including music records and films <<contains**T3**lex_item_choice**None**9**considers>> in its price the cost of factors used in its production – labour, capital, enterpreneurship skills and so on – and some extra amount of money to bring profit to producers. For example, the production of bread consists of the cost  of ingredients, cost of baker labour and etc. When people go to the store to buy bread, they pay for free (excluding some “free bread for pensioners”). If they do, they commit a crime and should go to jail. The films and music are no difference, just the price of them is distributed among several people or things (like tickets in the movie theatre or CD-disks). So <<if a person does not pay for the usage of those,**T4**Punctuation**None**47**if a person does not pay for the usage of those>> he/she should be punished the same way, as a bread-thief.
Moreover, illegal sharing of films and movies discriminates the ownership rights of producers. The goods they make are not public and can be easily excluded from consumption therefore every <<usage of**T5**Spelling**None**7**usageof>> those goods should bring profit. It is easier if consider it as a patent. Until patent cost is less then profit, the innovations will be made (so new movies will be filmed). If <<patents**T6**Spelling**None**8**patients>> fail (firm does not gain profit from extra production) the profit of the firm becomes negative, which means no innovations. Nobody wants not to be paid for their work. This situation can be overcome only by government intervention by subsidising the production of special goods or sponsoring their own production. Thus, government failures occur too often, so in the end ordinary users will not be able to consume the same amount and variety of goods (including films and music records). Therefore, there should be established a working judicial system to protect the ownership rights with decent punishment for not obeying the rules in order to provide people with their favourite music and movies.
To sum up, special laws should be established to <<protect**T7**Spelling**None**8**protects>> the rights of producers and provide various products for people’s use.
