It is commonly known that  music celebrities and people who produce film suffers from illigal copies of their act on the Internet. Some people believe that it is normal and they can do it without any punishment. Others think that it is unfair and people who copy files should pay fee for their manipulations. I believe if someone produced something, others should pay for that.

There is an opinion, that musicians and film producers have a very high income, so they might not lose a lot of money because of internet copies. Moreover, people will always go to the concerts and cinemas and pay a lot of money for these attractions. Therefore, celebrities can not lose amounts of money. Furthermore, tickets always are very expensive and only little percent of people can afford them. That is why pirates files are the only way for these people to hear favourite song or to see a new film.

The opponents believe that stars and producers pay a lot of time and forces to create something special for their audience. They spent their own money on dresses, dicorations and other special equipment. When pirate copies are on the Internet, artists do not have money that were earned by them. Besides, sometimes musicians and film producers can lose a huge ammount of their fans. It is quite easier for audience to stay at home and not to go to the show. Moreover, others singers could say that this song is belonging to them and in the future it will be difficult to find the truth.

Finally, in my opinion, I believe that people who make pirate copies should be punished because they do not have any rights to use the original content for their own perposes. People who want to see a new film or hear a new song can go to the concert or wait for several years.
