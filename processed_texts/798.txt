There is a situation when the government and political parties wish to suggest a system, is so call as “Guaranteed basic income”, where people will get some sum of money every month. Some would argue that is very costly and impossible, others would say that it is a great way to increase welfare of people. However, from my point of view, there is something that should be considered about.
Beginning with the cost, which will be got from the federal budget of a country, implying the loss of money, that could be applied to some crucial aspects connected to the existing problems, which need to be solved, for example: health care, education, legislative system and others. That will undoubtedly trigger a resonance in society and social institutions.
Another opinion states that, on the contrary, if the system is introduced, the level of welfare will take a higher point in people’s living. Everyone will be wealthier with an increased salary and at the same time happier, that he can let buy himself more and live better than he used to. Unfortunately, I do not think the guaranteed basic income will cover all people’s need for unconstrained living, so that citizens will be readily got used to it.
Finally, I would like to say that it is feasible a “Guaranteed Basic Income” system will be input, but it is unrealistic to think that this system will bring many benefits when it have worked, only slightly make people’s life better.
