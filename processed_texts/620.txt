Nowadays air pollution and global are the biggest problems for our government. However, I cannot agree with the idea that air travels mostly affect our Earth.
Firstly, the modern technology is becoming more and more d<<developed**T6**Spelling**None**10**developped>>that can let people to constuct insecure airplanes. Secondly, people travel by airplanes because it gives them the possibility to do a lot of useful things in time. So, if the amount of air travels reduced, m<<the most businessmen**T7**Articles**None**16**most businessmen>>can lose the chance to evolve their affairs and to become succesful. Moreover, sometimes people can let themselves to go to other countries for some leisure activities once per year. So, if this way of travelling can be f<<forbidden**T4**Spelling**None**8**forbiden>>by the government people will lose that single possibilty to relax near the sea or the ocean as well. Nevertheles, some opponents say that it is the most significant problem. I partly agree that a lot of air travel is unnecessary because trains are modernized now and it can offer us more comfortable ways to reach our d<<destination**T5**Spelling**None**12**destionation>> Besides, we usually spend a lot of time on short-term air travels instead of using cars or trains.
However, there is no doubt that governments should pay more attention to other problems that also cause various pollutions. For example, they could introduce laws that would re<<forbid**T3**lex_item_choice**None**6**reduce>>moking more than two times per day. Furthermore, they should think about the use of cars, th#DELETE#19#e contribution of lights and water at home. To sum up, I would like to say that governments have to solve the problem with air pollution and global warming. However, they should take into consideration all the aspects of that issue.
