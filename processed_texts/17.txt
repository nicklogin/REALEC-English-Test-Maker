Nowadays there is a <<widespread**T1**Spelling**None**11**wide spread>> opinion that piracy in <<the media sphere**T13**Articles**None**12**media sphere>> is a crime, and <<people who use illegal copies of films and music**T2**Defining**None**50**people, who use illegal copies of films and music,>> should be punished.
As for me, I can not totally agree with such position. <<Firstly**T7**Category_confusion**None**5**First>>, there are usually fixed amounts of money a person is ready to spend on different kinds of <<entertainment**T3**Countable_uncountable**None**14**entertainments>>. If <<he or she**T4**Absence_explanation**None**2**he>> is used to go to the cinema twice a month, <<he or she**T5**Absence_explanation**None**2**he>> won’t go there more often or pay for films at home, just because <<he or she**T6**Absence_explanation**None**2**he>> isn’t ready to spend so much money. <<Secondly**T8**Category_confusion**None**6**Second>>, film makers now earn fantastic amounts of money by demonstrating their films in cinemas, and <<if we speak**T9**lex_item_choice**None**4**what>> about musicians, their main source of income <<are**T10**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> their concerts. <<So**T15**Punctuation**None**3**So,>> there is no awful need for money for them. <<Thirdly**T11**Category_confusion**None**5**Third>>, if ordinary people are punished for piracy, their dissatisfaction will be much higher than dissatisfaction of authors, whose intellectual property <<was**T12**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> stolen. This is just because piracy has become usual in our country and it will be really hard for people to stop using such content.
On the other hand, punishing for piracy can be beneficial for the whole media industry, as it will provide film makers and musicians with more resources. <<So**T14**Punctuation**None**3**So,>> the industry is likely to develop. What is more, people will get used to <<respecting**T16**Category_confusion**None**7**respect>> intellectual property, what can be really beneficial for <<the development of society**T17**Articles**None**22**development of society>>.
To sum up, there are some advantages of fighting against piracy, but there are much more disadvantages. It will be better to preserve <<the current situation**T18**Articles**None**17**current situation>>, as any probable changes may cause people’s dissatisfaction and even protests.
