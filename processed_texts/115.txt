Largely noticeable in the statistics, the crimes commited by young people remain to be a major problem in the modern society, and is becoming more and more significant with time.
There are several reasons for this development, in my opinion. The most powerful of them is the evolution of video games throughout the last decades. Whereas they were originally created to educate and entertain (it is widely known that video games boost motor skills, for instance), nowadays video game developers are instead using whatever will keep kids playing, in their technological products. In the first order, violence. A lot of video games challenges nowadays require to kill, thieve, rob and so forth. As kids become used to the violence  on a computer screen, they easily bring it into the real life as well.
The other cause of this effect concerns violence on the TV screen. However, I consider it to be less powerful than the computer games case, as, in contrast with the TV, kids commit vigilant crimes in the video game themselves. Nevertheless, the TV plays a huge role in making kids used to the violence, that is why they do not see it as a bad feature.
The most important thing parents and teachers should do, in my view, is to encourage people (especially kids) to play good games and watch worthy films. In the modern society, parents rarely supervise what their kids do and do not watch, and what entertains them.
By creating a kind and friendly environment by teaching kids to search for good games and TV shows, parents and teachers may encourage young people to reject playing violent games and watching films involving vigilant activities, in favor of games and films that develop a good sense of humour and appeal our sensibility.
To sum up, I would say that as long as the violence remains the same on a computer and TV screen, it would remain the same in life. As soon as we discourage it there, the real-life crime rate among young people will start dropping.
