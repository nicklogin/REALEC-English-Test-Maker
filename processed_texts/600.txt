Why do we have such a big amount of <<crimes**T1**lex_item_choice**None**16**crime situations>> in the world? How can we reduce crime? There are two points of view on the last question, and we will try to discuss them both in the actual essay.
A<<On**T2**Prepositions**None**2**At>>the one hand, there is an opinion that we need to give the criminals longer time to spend in the prison.This idea could be suitable, because the prison changes people very much. The lack of freedom, bad conditions and a lot of time to think about their behaviour. Most of m<<murderers**T4**Suffix**None**7**murders>>stop to do steal or kill after they w<<have been to**T5**Tense_choice**None**7**were in>>the prison. At the same time, this idea is not absolutely right for all the people, because the majority of criminals think that they will never be cought. So, we have to invent somenthing else.
At<<On**T3**Prepositions**None**2**At>>he other hand, there are a lot of ways to reduce crime in the modern society. The alternative ways to do this consist of many strategies to rise the level of hu<<humans**T6**Possessive**None**6**humans>>i<<life**T7**lex_item_choice**None**4**live>>nd to turn the condition of their living to the better sight. For example, the government should give the sufficient ammount of work places, to de<<develop**T8**Spelling**None**7**devepol>>he educational system. The go<<government**T9**Spelling**None**11**governmemnt>>ave also to improve the economical, social and cultural domains. All these things can help to reduce th#DELETE#3#e crime, because no one will want to steal or to kill someone in a su<<successful**T11**Spelling**None**12**successifull>>ountry with the total order in it.
To sum it up, I can say that I prefer the second view, because I believe that all the people are good, and we can stop the crime before it will become a great problem.
