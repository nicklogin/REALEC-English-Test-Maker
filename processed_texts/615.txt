There are two charts that show which ways of transportation between countries in Eastern Europe have been used for different kinds of goods in 2008. First <<diagram**T2**Spelling**None**8**diagramm>> illustrates the amount of goods transported by rail. Second <<diagram**T3**Spelling**None**8**diagramm>> illustrates the amount of goods transported by road.
Mostly the rail is used to deliver metals that take 3<<35 percent**T4**Numerals**None**11**35 percents>>of the total amount and manufactured goods that take 2<<25 percent**T5**Numerals**None**11**25 percents>>of the total amount. So, these two categories o<<occupy**T6**Spelling**None**8**occupate>>more than a half of the whole rail traffic. At the same time, 2<<28 percent**T7**Numerals**None**11**28 percents>>of road traffic is taken for the same manufactured goods. That means the both ways are quite equally c<<comfortable**T8**Category_confusion**None**7**comfort>>and popular for manufactured goods' transportation. Also, road is mainly used for food products' transportation that o<<occupy**T9**Spelling**None**8**occupate>>30 percents of the whole road traffic. Unlike manufactured goods, food products only take 1<<11 percent**T10**Numerals**None**11**11 percents>>of the total amount of goods transported by the rail.
Chemicals has pretty similar percents of transportation by rail and by road as manufactured goods - 11<<11 percent**T11**Numerals**None**11**11 percents>>nd 16<<16 percent**T12**Numerals**None**11**16 percents>>Opposaly, machinery takes 12<<12 percent**T13**Numerals**None**11**12 percents>>y road against 2 <<2 percent**T14**Numerals**None**10**2 percents>>y road. And the last ca<<category, non-metallic minerals,**T15**Punctuation**None**30**category non-metallic minerals>>c<<occupies**T16**Spelling**None**7**occupes>>ess than 10<<10 percent**T17**Numerals**None**11**10 percents>>n amount transportated by rail and 13<<13 percent**T18**Numerals**None**11**13 percents>>n amount transportated by road.
The conclusion is that the rail is mostly used for hai<<heavy**T19**Spelling**None**5**haivy>>tal products' transportation and the road is mostly used for food and light products' transportation.
