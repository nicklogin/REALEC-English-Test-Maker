Nowadays <<a tendency to watch movies and download music from pirates, who copy original products and share them on their websites for their own purposes, is usual**T1**Standard**None**167**is usual tendency to watch movies and download music from illegal pirates resources, who copy original products and share them on their websites for their own purposes>>. But the social view on this <<practice**T10**Spelling**None**8**practise>> <<varies**T11**Agreement_errors**None**4**vary>> across the countries and <<depends on**T13**Prepositional_verb**None**12**depends from>> <<an attitude**T14**lex_item_choice**None**8**relation>> of citizens to importancy of intellectual rights and country’s law. In Western democratic societies people can think that this practice is illegal and unnormal, <<however,**T15**Punctuation**None**7**however>> people in not <<so**T16**lex_item_choice**None**4**such>> democratic societies as European or American can think that <<practice**T17**Spelling**None**8**practise>> of <<pirate**T18**Spelling**None**5**pirat>> copying is <<normal.**T19**Punctuation**Dependent_change**6**normal>> #DELETE#3#and 
So there <<are**T21**Spelling**None**3**ate>> <<two points of view**T22**Noun_number**None**17**two point of view>> on this situation with <<pirate**T23**Spelling**None**5**pirat>> copying.
Firstly, almost all people in really democratic societies think that copying and sharing music or films on the internet and downloading these files is not acceptable for fair people and good citizens <<, because**T25**Punctuation**None**7**because>> if you do that <<, you**T24**Punctuation**None**3**you>> steal money from producers and musicians, <<who**T26**Conjunctions**None**5**which>> spend a lot of time, money and other resources <<on**T27**Prepositions**None**3**for>> making <<these products**T28**Agreement_errors**None**12**this product>>. So in these societies pirate copying is bad and illegal. “Intellectual pirates” <<are like stealers**T30**Absence_comp_sent**None**13**like stealers>>, so they are punished by government and <<society**T31**Noun_number**None**9**societies>>. Exactly <<because of**T32**Prepositions**None**2**by>> this reason there are <<lots of**T33**Agreement_errors**None**8**a lot of>> scandalous deals in courts #DELETE#18#of this government. Intellectual rights as one of the main principles of modern democracy <<are protected**T35**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**protected>> by Western governments.
<<There is the other situation**T37**Absence_comp_sent**None**19**The other situation>> with #DELETE#10#problem of pirate copying in developed countries like Russia and other post-soviet countries. <<There is no practice of protecting intellectual rights**T39**Agreement_errors**None**56**There are not practice of protecting intellectual rights>> in these societies, so people such as musicians and <<film producers**T41**Noun_attribute**None**22**producers of the films>> understand that government <<does not punish**T42**Agreement_errors**None**13**do not punish>> for pirate copying. For people of this country <<it is normal**T43**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**is normal>> and not amoral <<, because**T44**Punctuation**None**7**because>> they have another culture, another view on rights. They usually say<< that**T45**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> they do not live in a good welfare state, so they only try to survive in this situation, when you do not have money for paying for music or <<films**T46**Noun_number**None**4**film>> on the internet.
All in all, pirate copying is not <<a good deal**T47**Articles**None**9**good deal>>, but in some countries <<this situation is normal**T48**Standard**None**19**is normal situation>>. I think it is not normal.
