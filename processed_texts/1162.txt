These graphs show the average maximum and minimum temperatures in two countries in two cities: Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro. 

The graph which shows the temperature in Yakutsk is like <<a mountain**T1**Articles**None**8**mountain>>. Because of that we can say that the difference between maximum and minimum is large. The difference is about 65*C. But in Brazil in Rio de Janeiro the situation is <<different**T2**lex_item_choice**None**4**else>>. The difference between average <<temperatures**T3**Noun_number**None**11**temperature>> is 15*C. These graphs <<show**T4**Agreement_errors**None**5**shows>> that Yakutsk is located in the cold <<place**T5**Noun_number**None**6**places>>, but <<Rio de Janeiro is located**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**14**Rio de Janeiro>> in the south. 

Let’s <<look at**T7**Prepositional_verb**None**6**see on>> <<every month's temperature**T8**Articles**None**29**the every month’s temperature>>. <<The highest**T9**Superlative_adj**None**13**The most high>> temperature in <<Yakutsk**T10**Articles**None**11**the Yakutsk>> <<is in July**T11**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**in July>> (25*C), in Rio de Janeiro <<it is in**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**is>> January (30*C). In Brazil in <<July**T13**Capitalisation**None**4**july>> the average temperature is 25*C, in Yakutsk in January <<the coldest**T14**Superlative_adj**None**13**the most cold>> <<weather**T15**Spelling**None**6**wether>>, the temperature is -42*C. That is why we can say that these cities <<are located**T16**Agreement_errors**None**10**is located>> in absolutely different points of <<Earth**T17**Articles**None**9**the Earth>>. 

<<We have**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**5**We’ve>> just seen two graphs which show the average maximum and minimum <<temperatures**T19**Noun_number**None**11**temperature>> in two cities: Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro. With the help of information which <<was**T20**Agreement_errors**None**4**were>> in these graphs we <<have detected**T21**Tense_choice**None**8**detected>>, where the cities <<are located**T22**Agreement_errors**None**10**is located>> and we <<have seen**T23**Tense_choice**None**3**saw>> <<a very big difference**T24**Articles**None**19**very big difference>> between them.
