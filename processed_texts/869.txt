The graphs below demonstrate the shift in death and birth rates, as well as population growth in the USA from 1750 to 2000.
The first graph shows stable n#DELETE#10#umbers of population growth from 1750 to 1800, followed by a slight rise from 1800 to 1850. The next two 50 years are marked by a m<<steady**T3**lex_item_choice**None**10**monotonous>>rise from 25 to 1<<150 million people**T4**Noun_number**None**22**150 millions of people>> then g<<comes**T10**lex_item_choice**None**4**goes>>the most significant growth by 125 million to the year 2000.
