It is stated that nowadays more crimes are being committed by young people than ever before.
In my opinion, the main cause of this problem is the lack of parents' and teachersâ€™ control and the lack of engagement of young people. Nowadays parents often work most of the time, having almost no time <<to spend with their children**T1**Absence_comp_sent**None**17**to their children>> left. Therefore, children have a lack of engagement. They do not <<receive**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> enough attention from their parents, so they need to engage themselves on their own.
At the same time, educational system in most of the countries is built <<in such way**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**the way>> that the majority of <<children**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**4**kids>> and <<adolescents**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**9**teenagers>> are bored, so they hate school and, therefore, are not engaged <<in**T16**Prepositions**None**4**with>> education.
As a result, young people are left uncontrolled and unengaged. At that very moment, the role of other <<children**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**4**kids>> and <<adolescents**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**9**teenagers>> around them is extremely important. And often badly raised <<children**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**4**kids>> have more authority in such cases. That is why a lot of young people are influenced by those trouble <<children**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**4**kids>>, so they also start behaiving badly and become juveniles.
From this perspective, parents and teachers can change the situation. First of all, parents should spend more time with their <<children**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**4**kids>> and engage them more. Secondly, teachers should <<do all they can**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**13**do their best>> to make young people #DELETE#5#being interested in their subjects. In addition to that, a special approach towards <<trouble**T2**lex_item_choice**None**8**troubled>> <<children**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**4**kids>> is required. If parents are not able to engage their children themselves, they should at least try to <<find**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**4**pick>> a good surrounding for them. If a child is surrounded by motivated pupils, he or she will also try to be better and study harder under their influence.
