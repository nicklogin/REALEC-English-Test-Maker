This chart demonstrates the average time people <<spent**T5**Tense_choice**None**5**spend>> doing sport and exercise in England in 2012. I am going to describe it and summarise the information it shows. 	The first fact that the chart illustrates is that the younger a person is the more exercise he or she does. People from 16 to 24 show spend more time doing sport than people of any other ages (282.1 minutes for men and 114.1 minutes for women). Than there is a considerable decrease: males from 25 to 34 spend 153.8 minutes and females spend 92.8. The oldest people (from 75) spend the least time exercising: 29.2 minutes for males and 10 minutes for females. 	The second trend shown by this chart is the fact that<< in general**T2**Punctuation**None**13**, in general,>> males spend more time doing sport than females. For example, men from 35 to 44 spend 120.6 minutes exercising while women only 92.8. However this trend is most representative only in <<extremum points**T4**lex_item_choice**None**17**extreme positions>>. For people between 16 and 24 and people from 75 the difference in time spent doing sport between males and females is almost three times, while for people from 55 to 74 this difference is not that dramatic (females between 55 and 64 spend even slightly more time doing sport <<than**T3**lex_item_choice**None**4**that>> males: 52.7 for men and 55.4 for women).
