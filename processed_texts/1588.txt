We cannot imagine our life without modern technology, which is everywhere. At the same time, a lot of people argue<< that**T37**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> it's causing an increasing number of health problems.
First of all, people <<believe**T3**Spelling**None**7**beilive>> that <<cancer**T4**Articles**None**10**the cancer>> can be caused by #DELETE#5#using modern technology <<although**T6**Spelling**None**9**althought>> <<scientists**T7**Spelling**None**10**sienctists>> <<have not proved**T1**suggestion**None**12**don't aprove>> it. The second <<health**T10**Spelling**None**5**helth>> problem connected with modern <<technology**T39**Spelling**None**9**tecnology>> is <<eyes**T13**Spelling**None**8**eyesight>> problem. We use a lot of gadgets <<which**T12**Spelling**None**4**wich>> have a strong <<influence on**T11**Prepositional_noun**None**13**influence for>> our <<eyes**T22**Spelling**None**3**eys>>. The third problem is <<obesity**T23**Spelling**None**7**abesity>>. From <<their childhood**T2**Determiners**None**13**the childhood>> people spend more time sitting and watching films or playing computer games than walking or running outdoors. The number of people <<suffering from**T19**Prepositional_verb**None**9**suffering>> <<obesity**T31**Spelling**None**7**abesity>> is increasing in <<developed**T24**Spelling**None**9**develomed>> countries.
To <<solve**T25**lex_item_choice**None**6**reduce>> such problems people should start thinking about their health. Modern technology <<itself**T18**Spelling**None**6**itsels>> <<doesn't**T26**Agreement_errors**None**5**don't>> <<cause**T27**Spelling**None**5**couse>> any health problem. First of all, <<we**T16**Pronouns**None**2**ur>> <<should**T17**Spelling**None**7**schould>> decrease time <<spent**T30**Voice**None**8**spending>> with our <<gatgets**T29**Spelling**None**7**gangets>> and use them only if it is <<necessary**T9**Spelling**None**10**neccessery>>. We <<should**T28**Spelling**None**7**schould>> pay more attention <<to**T15**Prepositions**None**3**for>> our bodies and health. There are a lot of modern <<technologies**T34**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> <<which**T14**Spelling**None**4**wich>> help to stay healthy.
To colclude, widespread use of modern technology cannot be the main <<reason for**T13**Prepositional_noun**None**9**reason of>> health proplems. It's all about people who don't use them right.
