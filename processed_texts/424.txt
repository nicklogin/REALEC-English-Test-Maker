Nowadays the rate of illegal actions committed by the youth has risen dramatically. This essay will consider some causes of this problem and will <<attempt**T1**Spelling**None**6**attept>> to offer some possible solutions.

First of all, the rising crime rate among young people is caused by poverty. What I am trying to say is that it is becoming more difficult to get a good education and to be employed by a prestigious company or run one's own business and have a decent income. That is why many people try to get money illegally, because it is the only way they have access to. A possible so<<solution**T3**Spelling**None**11**sollutution>>s to provide such people with higher salaries. For instance, the countries where there ar<<is**T10**Tense_form**None**3**are>>igher ra<<quality**T9**lex_item_choice**None**5**rates>>f income, th<<have**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**there are>>ower crime rates.

Another possible reason is the decl<<disappearance**T5**lex_item_choice**None**7**decline>>traditional values. What I mean by this is that modern values emphasise the necessity of achievements, but do not pay enough attention to moral values and the patterns of behaviour, which are appropriate in the society. One of the solutions, which can be offered, is to demostrate the consequences of such actions in order to make young people dwel<<consider**T7**lex_item_choice**None**8**dwell on>>s issue. A typical example is the practice in some schools in the USA to organise excursions to prisons, where teenagers have an opportunity to evaluate the situation and make the necessary conclusions.

To sum up, the rise of crime rates amid young people is borne out of various reason<<reasons**T8**Noun_number**None**6**reason>>ing in the society, like poverty or changing values. Although, these problems can be solved by improv<<improving**T6**Spelling**None**8**improvig>>inancial situation of this social group or by making young people aware of the consequences of illegal actions.
