Nowadays, a large quantity of people <<think**T2**Agreement_errors**None**5**thiks>> that spending money on different space programs is a waste of money and this money could be spent better in different domains. But is it <<as unnecessary as they think**T5**Punctuation**None**29**as unnecessary, as they think>>?

The space exploration be<<began**T6**Tense_choice**None**6**begins>>n 1950 and it was a huge step for the humanity. A lot of te<<technologies**T3**Spelling**None**11**tecnologies>>uch as concentrated food and video conversations were firstly developed for sp<<the space exploration**T7**Articles**None**17**space exploration>>nd nowadays they are used everywere. Consequently, a lot of modern va<<ways**T8**Spelling**None**4**vays>>f communication became possible only when sc<<scientists**T9**Noun_number**None**9**scientist>>nvented the artificial sa<<satellites**T10**Spelling**None**9**satelites>>For instance, the GP<<GPS navigation**T11**Spelling**None**14**GPS-navigation>>ecame possible only when all th<<these**T298**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>>a<<satellites**T12**Spelling**None**9**satelites>>ere sent into th<<space**T300**Articles**None**9**the space>>
With the deve<<development**T13**Spelling**None**13**developpement>>space exploration humans have<<have sent**T14**Tense_form**None**9**have send>>ot of junk in the space. Our planet is surrounded by broken sate<<satellites**T15**Spelling**None**9**satelites>>ckets etc. But this problem can be solved with the invention of the multi-use rockets by Elon Musk. The gases that are prod<<produced**T16**Spelling**None**8**prodused>>n the <<rocket fuel**T302**Articles**None**15**the rocket fuel>>ns are also very dangerous for the envi<<environment**T17**Spelling**None**12**environement>>d in the proc<<process**T18**Spelling**None**7**procces>>building a rocket base a lot of trees were<<are**T304**Lack_par_constr**None**4**were>>troyed. For example, when the famous rocket base Boyk<<Baykonur**T19**Spelling**None**8**Boykonur>>e<<was built**T308**Agreement_errors**None**10**were build>>lot of forests were destroyed.

To sum up, it is important to say that the space exploration plays a huge role in our daily lives and the gouver<<government**T22**Spelling**None**12**gouvernement>>to spend money on this. <<it**T306**Ref_device**None**4**this>>y opinion, the govern<<government**T23**Spelling**None**11**governement>> spend even more money on space exploration by heplin<<helping**T24**Spelling**None**7**hepling>>rivate develo<<developments**T25**Spelling**None**14**developpements>>as Elon M<<Elon Musk's**T308**Possessive**None**9**Elon Musk>>am.
