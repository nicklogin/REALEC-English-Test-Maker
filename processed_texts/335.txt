There is a dispute about illegal pirate copies. Different people have different opinions. My point of view is that there are many advanteges in pirate copies.
To begin with, I want to say that illegal copies are very helpful for people who can’t pay for the original discs. For instance, today because of crisis in Russia people have a lack of money. But they really want to listen to music and watch latest films. So, the only thing they can do is downloading these pirate copies. Moreover, I want to notice that original discs cost big money but their content is not always good. I think, only a few number of original discs should be distributed by producers because they must assess their products adequately.
However, some people won’t agree with me. Firstly, a lot of people worked to produce music or film. They consider that their work deserve money. Secondly, not all illegal pirate copies have really high quality.
As for me, today the technical progress goes on. You can always find a good copy of music or film. Sometimes you should wait a little bit to get it. Moreover, if you are good in working on computers, you can download programms and change the quality of product. 
In conclusion I want to say, that I don’t agree that people who download pirate copies should be punished. This is your own choice which version do you want to have original or copy. Nobody can punish you for making choice. I think, just before you will decide to buy or download music or film you should understand about all advantages and disadvanteges of your choice.
