The <<figure**T1**Spelling**None**7**firgure>> <<compares**T2**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**7**compare>> date between development of eBook <<and**T4**Spelling**None**3**ant>> the <<printed**T5**Category_confusion**None**5**print>> ones in 2014 and 2018 in the USA, the UK, Germany and China. It is clear, that there are two different <<tendencies**T6**Spelling**None**9**tendences>>: the number of ebooks will decrease to 2018 or, in contrast, will increase.
<<Firstly**T7**Spelling**None**6**Frstly>>, I want to highlight information <<about**T8**Prepositions**None**2**in>> development of ebooks in <<different countries**T9**Absence_explanation**None**9**countries>>. The number of increase in China and Germany will be similar - nearly 0,5 billion US dollars while the USA will demonstrate much more <<rapid**T10**Category_confusion**None**7**rapidly>> <<rise**T11**Category_confusion**None**7**raising>> - from 5,5 to 8,5 billion US dollars. It is evident that the lowest <<level of development**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**development>> of the book market is in the UK whereas the highest <<is in the USA**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**in the USA>>.
Furthermore, undoubtly <<the**T14**Determiners**None**4**that>> statement 'ebooks will be more popular' won't be true. The number of <<printed**T15**Category_confusion**None**5**print>> books in Germany will remain stable, in China and the UK it will <<slightly**T16**lex_item_choice**None**7**quietly>> <<fall**T17**Tense_form**None**4**fell>> and only in the USA it will be nearly doubled to 2018. Moreover, upward trends in using ebooks are <<in**T18**Spelling**None**2**ni>> all four countries: in the USA from 5,5 billion to 8,5, in China: from 0.5 to 1; in the UK from 1,8 to 2,3 and in #DELETE#3#the Germany from 1 to 0,5 billion in Dollars.
