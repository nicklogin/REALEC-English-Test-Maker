In this essay I will <<explain**T1**lex_item_choice**None**4**show>> #DELETE#3#why my opinion #DELETE#7#is that. Films and music should <<be free to**T4**Punctuation**None**11**be free, to>> all people.

I believe that every labor <<should be**T5**Modals**None**7**must be>> paid <<and**T6**lex_item_choice**None**3**for>> people have to pay for watching movies and <<listening to music**T7**Prepositional_verb**None**15**listening music>>. <<Music and films are**T8**Absence_comp_sent**None**15**Music and films>> <<an intellectual property**T9**Articles**None**21**intellectual property>> and must be paid for. It is necessary to arrest people who do not pay for it, but it is worth to impose a line #DELETE#2#on there. But many people <<cannot**T11**Spelling**None**7**can not>> afford going to <<movies**T12**Articles**None**10**the movies>> and concerts so they download everything from the <<Internet**T13**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>. <<In my opinion,**T15**Punctuation**None**13**In my opinion>> if <<films**T16**Noun_number**None**4**film>> <<were**T17**lex_item_choice**None**13**should not be>> free, that global corporation <<would lose**T18**Conditionals**None**4**lost>> a lot of many<< because**T20**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> people will lose respect. <<Besides**T22**lex_item_choice**None**7**Because>>, <<some people**T25**lex_item_choice**None**14**exempl orphans>> <<cannot**T21**Spelling**None**7**can non>> afford to <<pay for**T23**Prepositional_verb**None**6**pay to>> fims and music concerts<< like**T24**Punctuation**None**6**, like>> many others.

<<So,**T27**Punctuation**None**2**So>> #DELETE#4#same if the music and films <<are**T28**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> paid, <<musicians**T29**Articles**None**13**the musicians>> and actors will lose fame, because people will stop #DELETE#13#listening and watching <<their**T31**Ref_device**None**4**them>> <<movies**T32**Spelling**None**5**moves>>. <<After all,**T33**Punctuation**None**9**After all>> they <<cannot**T34**Spelling**None**7**can not>> pay for these services. <<Because**T35**Spelling**None**6**Becaus>> << no one has the right to force people to walk violently and pay violently**T36**Standard**None**70**force people to walk violently and pay violently, no one has the right>>. Therefore  <<I think that**T38**Punctuation**None**13**I think, that>> <<everything**T40**lex_item_choice**None**3**all>><<:**T39**Punctuation**None**1**,>> and music, and movies should be free <<to**T41**Spelling**None**2**fo>> all people. Students in creative universities have to watch a lot of films and listen to a lot of music. If they had to pay for all this, they would not have been able to study<< because**T43**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> most students have <<no job**T44**Negation**None**7**not job>><< and**T45**Punctuation**None**5**, and>> have <<no money**T46**Negation**None**9**not money>>. 

In this essay I <<explained**T47**lex_item_choice**None**11**have showed>> why I think that <<musicians and film producers' products**T48**Absence_explanation**None**28**musicians and film producers>> should be free, and #DELETE#6#becaus if <<it**T50**Ref_device**None**4**this>> <<is**T51**Tense_choice**None**4**will>> not so <<, then**T52**Punctuation**None**4**then>> companies that <<work with**T53**lex_item_choice**None**4**deal>> musicians and film producers lose money.
