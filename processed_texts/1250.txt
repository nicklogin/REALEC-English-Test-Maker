Technologies are an essential part of modern life. People <<cannot**T1**Spelling**None**7**can not>> imagine their ordinary day without technologies. We use them at home, work, on <<streets**T2**Noun_number**None**6**street>>. All of us have computers, mobile phones, CD-players. Of course, technologies <<influence**T3**Transitive**None**12**influence on>> our life. The widespread use of modern technology <<causes**T4**Voice**None**10**is causing>> an increasing number of health problems. For instance, a lot of people start to have problems with their eyes and nervous system. 

Nowaday there are a lot of people <<wearing**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> glasses because they use their gadgets every day. In my opinion, there are a lot of solutions of <<this**T6**Ref_device**None**5**these>> problem. We can see that there are <<a lot of**T7**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**a lot>> children have bad vision. Schools should think about <<the health**T8**Articles**None**6**health>> of pupils. <<Teachers**T9**Noun_number**None**7**Teacher>> should play with pupils when they have free time. A lot of pupils use their gadgets <<in**T10**Prepositions**None**2**on>> free time, of course, <<there should be**T11**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**should be>> <<a medical check up**T12**Articles**None**16**medical check up>> <<for**T13**Spelling**None**3**fir>> all citizens of countries. It <<helps**T14**Agreement_errors**None**4**help>> to solute <<the problem**T15**Articles**None**9**a problem>>. 

Many people have <<problems**T16**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> with <<nervous systems**T17**Absence_explanation**None**7**nervous>>. For example, they play computer <<games**T18**Spelling**None**5**hames>>, <<surf**T19**Spelling**None**4**serf>> #DELETE#2#on the Internet at night. All of this <<influences**T22**Transitive**None**12**influence on>> out health. Government can solute this problem, for example, <<by developing**T23**Confusion_of_structures**None**7**develop>> sport in <<countries**T24**Noun_number**None**7**country>>. It is more healthy to do sport than play computer games.  It <<helps**T25**Agreement_errors**None**4**help>> <<people to be**T26**Standard**None**12**to be people>> <<more**T27**Spelling**None**4**mire>> healthy and sporty. <<Of course,**T28**Punctuation**None**9**Of course>> <<a medical check up**T29**Articles**None**16**medical check up>> is important too. <<Schools**T30**Noun_number**None**6**School>> should work with children and explain them that gadgets influence their health not in a good way. 

In conclusion, <<the problem**T31**Articles**None**7**problem>> of gadgers is important today. It depends on <<every person individually**T32**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**individually>>. All our society should understand this problem and think about the solutions. Government should work with children and <<talk**T33**lex_item_choice**None**7**discuss>> about <<the influence**T35**Articles**None**10**influation>> of gadgets.
