There is a controversial question that today the athletes should be panished and be declined from the competition on for a period of time. Firstly, some people claim that it is effective to bann sportsmen from competing for their entire life. Secondly, others think it is unnessecary and it would be more convinient to limit this time to several years only. This essay discuss both opinions and give the most balanced solution for the situation.
On the one hand, it is easier to refuse athletes to participate in any sort of professional competitions for the rest of their lives, because there is no need to focus on the details of the each case and the amount of illegal drugs, which were used. Due to this fact, jures do not have to collect the whole information about the athlete and can make a decision far more faster, because they would have precident in their practice. In addition, it tends to be way more honest to give the same arest for each sportsman. As far as I am concerned, this opinion is rather stricktly and the soft power is more productive in this field.
On the other hand, the athletes need to recognize their mistake and to inculcate virtues and the professional ethics they have to be banned for some period of time. Furthermore, the carreer in this sphere is complex and people, who choose it practically always do only training activities for their whole life, so they have no time to get another qualification and higher education. To my mind, it is the most proper way to regulate such illegal doings.
In conclusion, there is no the only right way to solve the problem of using illegal drugs in sports field, but I stress the opinion that people from this sphere should have an opportunity to continue their career in any case after the period of time.
