Air pollution and global warming are significant problems of modern world. It is known that they extremely increase by the affection of air travel. However, in my opinion, people cannot refuse from air travelling even partially because it has already became the important part of their lives.
Firstly, it is obvious that travelling by plane is much more convenient than, for example, by car or by train. It takes less time, what really makes sense in case someone suddenly decides to get somwhere quickly. Once I was in a very unpleasant situation - I knew that I should be at the conference in Crimea the next day, and the only way to do it was to take a plain. Moreover, air travel is comfortable, whereas in trains it is terribly hot in summer. It is very difficult to spend time there, especially if your trip is long.
Secondly, cars are more dangerous than plains. The statistic shows that the risk of car accident is very big. Although the accident happened during air are always shown on TV and seemed to be frequent, it is not true.
Thirdly, there are lots of places where people can go only in the air. For instance, Kamchatka is surrounded by mountains and there is no opportunity to get through them by car.
All thing considered, one has to conclude that government should not make the amount of air travel smaller. Plains are necessary for different needs, and without them many people would suffer. Consequently, the scientists should find out another ways to protect our planet from air pollution and global warming.
