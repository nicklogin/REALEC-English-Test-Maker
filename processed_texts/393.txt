The charts illustrates the number of white and non-white people in general and in prison population in the UK and the USA in 2015. Now we will discuss this chart here.

As you can see from the chart, there are about 88 percent of whie people and only 12 percent of no<<non-white**T1**Spelling**None**8**non-whte>>eople in USA. So, there are almast two times more white than non-white people in USA in general. We also can see that the 26 percent of prisoners are none-white people.

There is other situation in UK. There are 64 percent of white people and 36 percent of none white people. However the number of non-white prisoners is two times more than the number of white prisoners. There are 67 procent of none-white people in prison generation and 33 percent of white people.
In conclusion, I would like to point out that the the prison population of none-white people in UK is rediculously higher than in USA. There are 67 percent of none-whte peole in UK and only 26 percent in USA.
