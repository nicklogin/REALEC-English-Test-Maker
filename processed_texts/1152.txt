Thousands of people nowadays prefer downloading illegal pirate copies to purchasing the original prices, meanwhile the authors of those files <<lose**T1**Tense_choice**None**10**are losing>> enormous sums of money every year. It is mostly agreed that people who #DELETE#4#does download <<these**T3**Ref_device**None**5**those>> illegal copies must be punished. This essay will discuss the provided points of view and <<agrees**T4**Agreement_errors**None**5**agree>> with the fact that people who download pirate files on Internet <<steal**T5**Tense_choice**None**11**are staling>> <<information**T6**Articles**None**15**the information>> from its author. 

On the one hand, the <<case**T7**lex_item_choice**None**4**fact>> of downloading illegal copies and files is unfair, firstly, towards the famous musician or film director. There are lots of pirate sites on <<the Internet**T8**Articles**None**8**Internet>> that <<provide**T9**Tense_choice**None**13**are providing>> access to a diverse range of works to download for free. For example, every person now can get any song he/she <<wants**T10**Agreement_errors**None**4**want>> to listen for free. However, the <<other**T11**lex_item_choice**None**9**different>> part of humanity still pays for every song or film to download from Appstore, for example.

On the other hand, as <<long**T12**Category_confusion**None**6**longer>> as such pirate sites exist, #DELETE#9#as longer consumers would use it and this is a huge problem that <<needs**T14**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> to be solved. If there were no illegal <<online**T15**lex_item_choice**None**8**Internet>> resources or illegal documents, people would not have <<anything**T16**lex_item_choice**None**9**something>> free to download and they will anyway use only original resources with fixed prices. So we will not have thieves. 

By <<the way**T17**Articles**None**3**way>> of conclusion, there are some measures that need to be taken to restrict and finally stop consumers from downloading copyright materials for free. First of all, government and police are ought to establish fees both for companies who spread illegal copies and for those people who download <<them**T18**Ref_device**None**2**it>>. <<When**T19**lex_item_choice**None**4**Then>> this measure is taken, it is better to make prices a bit lower to make original music, <<films**T20**Noun_number**None**4**film>> etc more accessible and obtainable for consumers.
