Some countries in order to diminish some serious civil issues are considering the program <<whose**T4**Defining**None**5**which>> aim is to provide citizens a minimal amount of money. Will this policy <<do**T1**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> more good than bad? This is what I’m going to speculate about in this essay.

Despite the fact that such program seems to be quite beneficial, it has some downsides too. First of all, the number of unemployed people will grow dramatically since there won’t be any reason for them to find a job. For example, such governmental programs exist in some countries in Europe. Almost the most part of the population is homeless people, who li<<live on**T6**suggestion**None**8**live for>>oney given by go<<a government**T7**Articles**None**10**government>>so that there are even vast sw<<swathes**T11**suggestion**None**6**swaths>>f the cities of poor people.
