Nowadays sport plays the essential role in everyday people's life. It cannot be <<denied**T1**Tense_form**None**6**denyed>> that a lot of people are the fans of different kinds of sports and like to watch <<sports**T27**Noun_number**None**5**sport>> or even to go <<to**T28**Prepositions**None**2**at>> the stadiums. Moreover, many prefer to spend a huge amount of money in <<order**T3**Spelling**None**4**oder>> to buy <<a ticket**T29**Articles**None**6**ticket>> <<to**T30**Prepositions**None**2**at>> various live sport events. However, a lot of people claim that watching <<sports**T4**Noun_number**None**5**sport>> <<is**T5**Redundant_comp**None**5**it is>> a waste of time. This essay disagrees with the statement and <<will**T31**Spelling**None**4**wiil>> provide some <<relevant**T32**Spelling**None**9**rellevant>> arguments against it.

To start with, not only important do<<do sport is**T34**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**do sport>>ut also it is significant to watch it and be aware of some real pl<<games**T33**lex_item_choice**None**5**plays>>r matches.

On the other hand, it is not fa<<fair**T13**Category_confusion**None**6**fairly>>o claim that watching sp<<sports**T14**Noun_number**None**5**sport>>t different live matches is a waste of time, because it is a kind of interaction among people. Furthermore, at these matches pe<<a person**T26**Articles**None**6**person>>an find his/her soulmate and become friends. For instance, future friends can share their personal advice, can help each other and simply go to ma<<matches**T15**Noun_number**None**5**match>>n od<<order**T16**Spelling**None**4**oder>>o relax or vo<<bet**T17**lex_item_choice**None**4**vote>>or the favourite team.
