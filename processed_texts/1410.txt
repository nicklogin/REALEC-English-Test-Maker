There are two round diagrams, that <<are**T1**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> divided into six palets: machinery, metals, food products, non-metallic minerals, chemicals and manufactured <<goods**T2**Noun_number**None**4**good>>. We can see two <<options**T3**lex_item_choice**None**7**varites>> of <<the transportation of**T4**lex_item_choice**None**6**moving>> good (by rail and by road) in Europe in 2008.

<<We should note**T37**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**Should note>> here that 2 charts are different, but <<they have some similar positions**T38**Standard**None**32**some positions they have similar>>. <<It is so clear**T39**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**So clear>> that metals <<are possible to be transported**T40**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**possible>> transported by rail and by road, but food products <<are better to be transported**T41**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**better>> transported by road, <<although,**T44**Punctuation**None**8**although>> metals <<are better to be**T42**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**better>> <<transported**T43**Category_confusion**None**8**transopt>> by <<rail**T45**Spelling**None**3**rai>>.
