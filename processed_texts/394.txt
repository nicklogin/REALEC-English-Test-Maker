There are a huge number of people who are crazy about watching <<sports**T2**Noun_number**None**5**sport>>. Most of people have <<their**T3**Spelling**None**5**thair>> <<favourite**T4**Spelling**None**8**favourit>> sport team who they support through <<thick**T5**Spelling**None**4**thik>> and thin. But others say that it is just a waste of time. There are arguments of both sides, however, which we will discuss here.
Personally, I agree with this statement. Watching s<<sports**T6**Noun_number**None**5**sport>>will not make us smarter or better. It won't also inform us about something that we d<<did not**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn't>>know before. So, because of this, I think that people can do something more useful for them i<<instead of**T8**Prepositions**None**7**instead>>watching s<<sports**T9**Noun_number**None**5**sport>> Moreover, there are some sport fans w<<who are too keen**T11**Participial_constr**None**12**who too keen>>on t<<their**T10**Spelling**None**5**thair>>f<<favourite**T13**Spelling**None**8**favourit>>team and it can lead to having an a<<argument**T12**Noun_number**None**9**arguments>>with fans of another team.
However, some people ca<<cannot**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can't>>gree with this. They think that sport helps us to express our patriotic feelings because most of people support te<<teams**T15**Noun_number**None**4**team>>rom th<<their**T16**Spelling**None**5**thair>>ountries. Furthemore, it can br<<bring people together**T17**Redundant**None**26**bring some people together>>Beeing crazy about sport can help people to find a <<new friends**T18**Articles**None**13**a new friends>>ho have th<<same interests**T19**Articles**None**18**the same interests>>s<<with them**T20**Prepositions**None**7**as they>>It is also a good way to have a rest after a difficult day. In conclusion, I would like to point out that I ca<<cannot**T21**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can't>>ee an<<anything useful**T24**lex_part_choice**None**17**any useful things>>n watching sp<<sports**T22**Noun_number**None**5**sport>>ut I do<<do not**T23**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don't>>ave anything against it because every person has his own way of relaxing and th<<also there is nothing harmful in it**T26**Absence_comp_sent**None**34**also there is noting harmful in it>>But, as for me, it is not my cup of tea and I would prefer reading or playing the guitar.
