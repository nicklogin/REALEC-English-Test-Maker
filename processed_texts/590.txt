It is a well-known fact that a lot of people prefer to watch British or American films, although film industry also takes place in their own country. Governments have an opportunity to support local films, but there is a question about its necessarity.
Firstly, these people definitely has reasons to watch other country's films and ignore local products. Probably their country makes bad quality films having no plot, with absolutely n<<untalented**T2**Derivation**None**12**non-talanted>>cast. In this case inhabitans will watch films they like more. It is easy to find something special from a great number of British and American films. Moreover, film industry in America is the greatest one, so it is sponsored well and has an experience in producing the best films in history.
However, it would be a nice idea to give a chance to local films. It is hard to make a good film which can be compared with Hollywood's products, if you have not enough money. If government wants to lead their film industry to the first place, it should support local movie makers, but not all of them. As far as I am concerned, some films do not deserve supporting with money because of its lack of ideas. Money cannot change the plot or give a ta<<talent**T1**Spelling**None**6**talant>>or some actors. A well-sponsored film will probably have a huge level of graphic design, wonderful costumes and ubiquitous advertisment, but it is not the main reasons to call some film great. A good film contains an exciting plot and cast which makes you feel all things that is describing in the film by yourself.
People usually choose British and American films for watching because of some reasons. It is important to support local film industry in order to make it better, but not all of them, as far as not all of local films have a bad quality only because of lack of money.
