<<A. Orlenko**T1**DET**None**3**The>> diagram <<illustrates**T189**Tense_choice**None**11**illustrated>> amount of <<goods transported**T190**Standard**None**17**transported goods>> between Eastern European countries in <<2008**T177**Punctuation**None**5**2008.>> by two differen ways of transport: rail and road.
As it can be seen from the pie chart, in 2008 approximately the <<same**T191**lex_item_choice**None**5**equal>> amount of manufactured goods was transported by road and by rail (28% and 25%). <<As for**T178**lex_part_choice**None**11**What is for>> machinery, these goods were mostly moved by rail transport: 12% <<compared**T179**Category_confusion**None**7**compare>> to 2% by the road. Speaking of rail transportation, it is obvious from the pie chart, that the <<greatest**T180**Superlative_adj**None**5**great>> part of <<the whole transportation**T181**Articles**None**20**whole transportation>> <<is made up by**T182**lex_item_choice**None**2**is>> metals which <<account for**T183**lex_item_choice**None**7**consist>> 35% of general rail moving. However, only 11% of goods transported by road <<are**T184**Spelling**None**3**and>> metals, which is three times as less as by rail. <<Thw difference**T185**Articles**None**10**Difference>> between amount food products transporting is three times as less for rail as for road
In conclusion, as the diagram shows, goods <<were**T188**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> <<transported**T186**Spelling**None**12**thransported>> between countries in Eastern <<Europe**T187**Spelling**None**5**Europ>> countries in 2008 in different proportions.
