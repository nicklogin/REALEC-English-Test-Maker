The level of commiting crimes <<is**T8**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> getting <<higher**T1**Comparative_adj**None**4**high>> these days among the young generation and <<it is considered**T2**Absence_explanation**None**13**is considered>> to be a huge problem which needs to be solved. Firstly, this essay#DELETE#1#, will discuss the main reason why <<it happens**T4**suggestion**None**14**does it happen>> nowadays and secondly, it will suggest <<some**T5**Determiners**None**7**some of>> possible solutions to deal with this hurdle.
In my opinion, I#DELETE#12# think that the main reason why the situation l<<is**T18**lex_item_choice**None**5**looks>>like that is because parents of those kids are some kind of laid-back people and they do not pay any attention to the development and behaviour of their children due to their own career growth or even their lazyness. I am not saying that every parent can act like this but I know a lot of families in which c<<children**T10**suggestion**None**5**child>>can live on their own whithout any p<<parential**T9**Spelling**None**7**parenta>> regardment. That is why young people c<<cannot**T11**Spelling**None**7**can not>>distinguish which action is bad and which one is good. They start to u<<take**T21**suggestion**None**3**use>>drugs or even sell them to get some money and some of them d<<decide**T12**Agreement_errors**None**7**decides>>to m<<commit**T22**suggestion**None**4**make>>a robbery or in hard cases they can murder somebody. This fact is really terrifying.
To solve this problem, I would like to su<<offer**T15**lex_item_choice**None**7**suggest>>o<<the government**T17**Articles**None**10**government>>o create some social pr<<programms**T16**Spelling**None**8**programs>>hich would be held at schools and universities wh<<, where**T23**suggestion**None**5**where>>hildren would be taught how to behave in society and would be given a <<information about laws**T13**suggestion**None**15**a law education>>f the country where they live. I think that these methods will help them to become good citizens of their co<<country**T14**Spelling**None**7**contry.>>n conclusion, I would like to say that we need to look after our young generation in a proper way because they are considered to be our future and we need to give them the<< a role model**T19**Word_choice**None**26**the model of how to behave>> the society and then the situation with commiting crimes will change a lot in the near future.
