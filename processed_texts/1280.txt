The connection of health problems with the development of modern technology is <<quite actual**T15**Absence_comp_colloc**None**6**actual>> these days. The main problems are revealed in <<common**T1**lex_item_choice**None**5**often>> <<headaches**T2**Noun_number**None**8**headache>> and <<weak**T3**Category_confusion**None**7**weaking>> nervous <<system**T4**Spelling**None**6**sistem>>, while the solution can be found in the <<increase**T5**Spelling**None**12**increasement>> of <<people's**T16**lex_item_choice**None**12**population’s>> activity. Firstly, this essay will describe some problems connected with <<the use of**T17**Category_confusion**None**5**using>> of technologies <<, and**T6**Punctuation**None**3**and>> then there will be given solutions to <<reduce**T7**Category_confusion**None**10**redusement>> #DELETE#2#of <<the negative effects**T9**Articles**None**16**negative effects>>. 

The main problem is that people spend, or sometimes have to, too much time doing their work or everyday activity <<in front of**T18**Prepositions**None**4**with>> #DELETE#14#the usement of different types of computers. <<As a result**T19**Prepositions**None**9**In result>>, they may feel <<blind**T11**Category_confusion**None**9**blindness>>, <<a headache**T20**Articles**None**8**headache>>, pain in <<the eyes**T12**Articles**None**4**eyes>> #DELETE#8#after it. The results of the recent research made by the “Modern life” proved that people, who spend their both free and <<working**T13**Spelling**None**7**wording>> time outdoors, were more positive and had less problems than the different group, which had to work all day long in the office. 

It <<leads**T14**Agreement_errors**None**4**lead>> to the main decision for this problem, as it means, that to reduce the negative effect of different types of computers on people’s health, they <<need to spend**T23**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**10**need spend>> more time<< doing**T24**Punctuation**None**7**, doing>> their leasure activities apart from technology. In other words, it means that the using of machines <<makes people forget**T25**Verb_object_bare**None**22**makes people to forget>> about real life but as they <<appear**T26**Tense_choice**None**8**appeared>> to be biological creatures, the outdoor life can be called their natural need. The investigation of Russian research company “Health today” in 2010 revealed that having at least 2 days per week for outdoor activities is necessary to reduce the influence of modern technologies on health. 

To conclude, this essay shows that one of the main solutions to reduce the <<amount**T27**lex_item_choice**None**5**among>> of health problems caused by technologies is being more active and spending more time outdoors.
