The graph illustrates amount of money gained by <<book markets**T4**Articles**None**16**the book markets>> in four <<countries**T9**Word_choice**None**6**states>> in 2014 and a prediction for 2018. It can be clearly seen that the USA <<is**T1**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> a prominent leader in book <<sales**T10**Category_confusion**None**7**selling>>.
First of all, the <<USA's**T5**Possessive**None**3**USA>> benefit from print books in 2014 <<accounted for**T11**Word_choice**None**9**consisted>> 10,5 billion of US dollars, while nearly the half of this amount #DELETE#8#of money was received from eBook trade (5,5 billion). The forecast shows, however, a significant decrease in print books profit, which is from 10,5 to 7,5 billion, and a dramatic <<increase**T13**Word_choice**None**4**rise>> in eBook <<sales**T3**Category_confusion**None**6**saling>> to tremendous 8,5 billion. <<With regard**T14**Linking_device**None**7**Turning>> to Germany, its benefit from print in 2014 was 6 billion dollars, whilst eBook revenue <<accounted for**T16**Word_choice**None**9**consisted>> <<an insignificant**T15**Word_choice**None**6**a tiny>> 1 billion. Despite this amount not being <<remarkable**T18**Word_choice**None**5**great>>, forecast <<promises**T19**Word_choice**None**5**tells>> that it will <<increase**T8**Word_choice**None**6**change>> to 1,5 billion in 2018. As for <<the print**T17**Articles**None**5**print>>, it is believed to remain stable. Regarding Chinese market, <<its**T20**Pronouns**None**4**it's>> revenue from <<sales**T7**Category_confusion**None**6**saling>> was 4,8 billions in 2014 and is predicted to fluctuate <<insignificantly**T21**Prefix**None**15**unsignificantly>> to 4,2 in 2018. It is shown that eBook profit will rise to 1 billion from 0,5, which is <<also insufficient**T6**Adverbs**None**17**insufficient too.>> The last point to consider is the UK, where amount of money gained from both print and electronic books trade is quite low: 2,6 billion for print and 1,8 for eBook in 2014, which will hesitate to 2 billion and 2,3 respectively.
