Nowadays, the spread of the Internet <<has made**T1**Tense_choice**None**4**made>> it much easier to use, <<listen to**T2**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> and watch illegal copies of different entertainment products. That is the reason of huge decreases in revenues of <<a great number**T4**Articles**None**12**great number>> of musicians, musical and film producers, and entertainment industry as a whole. These people and their supporters state that <<online**T5**Spelling**None**6**onlene>> piracy must be illegal, and <<online**T6**Spelling**None**6**onlene>> <<pirates**T7**Spelling**None**7**perates>> must <<be punished**T8**Voice**None**8**punished>> by law. 
<<In this essay i will discuss**T9**Ref_device**None**23**This essay will discuss>>, firstly, my point of view on the issue, secondly, several arguments supporting my opinion, and thirdly, conditions under which the problem could be resolved.
To begin with<<, in my opinion,**T10**Punctuation**None**15**, in my opinion>> it is illegal to use any sort of pirate copies of any product. I think that every honorable person should avoid using such kind of copies.
Firstly, any kind of labour must be paid. <<Neither industrial worker nor singer will do**T11**Negation**None**48**Neither industrial worker nor singer will not do>> any job or produce any product if he or she does not have money for a flat or house or food.
Secondly, artists or film makers have to be free from <<a problem**T12**Articles**None**7**problem>> of earning money for everyday <<expenses**T13**Spelling**None**8**expences>> in order to be able to produce different pieces of art.
Nevertheless, there must be some conditions under which it will be ethic to call <<online**T14**Spelling**None**6**onlene>> piracy a crime. First of them is that entertainment products should be <<available**T15**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**10**attainable>> <<for**T16**Prepositions**Dependent_change**2**by>> the majority of population of a country.
Secondly, it must be easier and more <<convenient**T17**Spelling**None**10**convinient>> to buy an entertainment product, not to steal it.
To sum up, I want to say that human society needs to come up with a solution for everybody, not just for one <<separate**T18**Derivation**None**9**separated>> group of people.
