In recent years <<people who make music, films or books**T1**Defining**None**38**people, who make music, films or books>> try to control downloading their products without <<buying them**T2**Absence_explanation**None**6**buying>>. So, some countries (<<the USA**T3**Articles**None**3**USA>>, for example) <<don’t allow their citizens to make copies**T5**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**38**don’t allow their citizens make copies>> or <<download films or music**T7**Absence_explanation**None**8**download>> without paying for <<products**T8**Noun_number**None**7**product>>. But there are <<other ones**T9**lex_item_choice**None**12**another ones>><< that**T10**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> don’t control <<the Internet sphere**T11**Articles**None**15**Internet sphere>> <<, so**T12**lex_item_choice**None**3**and>> it <<became**T13**Tense_choice**None**9**is become>> mostly pirate (<<Eastern**T14**Spelling**None**4**Eeat>> Europe). In my personal opinion, illegal pirate copies in our reality is <<an absolutely normal thing**T15**Articles**None**23**absolutely normal thing>>. Why? First of all, there <<is**T16**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> really a lot of content (music, films, books) <<on**T18**Prepositions**None**2**in>> <<the Internet**T17**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. <<So**T19**Punctuation**None**3**So,>> it is difficult to regulate this sphere. <<Secondly**T20**Category_confusion**None**6**Second>>, some people have no chance to pay for <<a useful content**T21**Articles**None**14**useful content>>. For example, people in African <<countries**T22**Spelling**None**8**counties>> or in some Asian <<countries**T23**Spelling**None**8**counties>> really have no money to pay for books <<like**T25**lex_item_choice**None**2**as>> more <<rich**T24**Spelling**None**5**reach>> countries. And <<thirdly**T26**Category_confusion**None**5**third>>, there <<is**T27**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> a lot of ways to make money for musicians, filmmakers and authors. They can give some concerts, lectures for money. Also, they can use advertising as a way to have money by recommending #DELETE#14#or advertising some products.
To <<summarize**T29**Spelling**None**9**summarise>> the information above, copying and sharing music, films or books is <<a normal process**T30**Articles**None**14**normal process>> in <<the modern world**T31**Articles**None**12**modern world>>. As <<i**T32**Capitalisation**None**1**i>> <<said**T33**lex_item_choice**None**14**have remainded>> before, <<the Internet**T34**Articles**None**8**Internet>> is <<a very difficult sphere to regulate**T52**Articles**None**33**very difficult to regulate sphere>>. Also, <<if**T37**Capitalisation**None**2**If>> we talk about <<regulations**T38**Noun_number**None**10**regulation>>, there are some problems with it – countries, where human rights may be <<ignored**T39**Tense_choice**None**8**ignoring>> by its government, it is too risky to close platforms. <<For example,**T41**Punctuation**None**11**For example>> <<in**T42**Prepositions**None**2**of>> <<authoritarian**T43**Spelling**None**12**autoritarian>> <<countries**T44**Spelling**None**8**counties>> we see the situation, when <<the majority of country’s population**T45**lex_item_choice**None**29**the most country’s population>> <<has**T46**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> no information about political prisoners, about corruption and so on.
<<To be honest,**T47**Punctuation**None**12**To be honest>> it is <<needed**T48**Tense_choice**None**4**need>> to say that authors of books, music or films really lose huge <<amounts**T49**Noun_number**None**6**amount>> of money, but as <<i**T50**Capitalisation**None**1**i>> <<said**T51**Tense_choice**None**3**say>> before – regulation is not the best solution. And for musicians, filmmakes, authors there <<is**T53**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> a lot of other ways to <<earn**T52**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> money for their products.
