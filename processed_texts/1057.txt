Nowadays more laws are being established to prevent illegal pirate copies of films and music. The world is becoming more virtual so it is essential to protect the intellectual property. I think it is a positive trend to restrict the acsess to illegal materials, but punising for free downloading is too strict measure.

It should be clearly understood by government and the people that intellectual property must be paid for. There is no difference between making an armchair and creating article. Both of the action is work and must be paid for. Concerning laws of punishment people for coping and sharing films, my opinion is that the government should make sure that any materials in the internet are protected from stealing. Educational programmes should be held to inform people. Punishment will not be helpful if a person does not realize what his crime is.

There are lots of countries where people live in poverty and can not afford bying their entertainment and education, you would say. But people involved in the sphere of intellectual work will suffer from stealing in these unwealthy countries also. People should understand that their children may lose all the money because of illegal download. When they will realise that to soon all the work will be virtual and there is no other way to earn money unless protecting your intellectual property, then they care about original discs.

To sum up, I believe that protecting intellectual property from stealing is a continuous process. But when the world will complitely go virtual there will not be other way than live under the law.
