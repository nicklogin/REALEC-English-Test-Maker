The experience of summer Olympics-2016 in Rio showed the actuality of drug use problem in big sports and provoked a wide discussion. Some people say that athletes caught using illegal drugs should leave professional competing for the rest of their lives, others are sure that a limited period of banning of those athletes is enough. This essay will discuss both positions and state the one with wich the <<author**T8**Spelling**None**5**autor>> agrees.
The idea of banning athletes <<who used**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**using>> drugs for the rest of their lives has <<a**T17**Articles**None**3**its>> right to exist. First of all, because sport is about <<discipline and following**T10**Punctuation**None**26**discipline - and following>> the rules. Furtermore, professional sports are just about <<hard work,**T6**Punctuation**None**11**hardworking>> and <<letting the cheating athletes compete**T14**Word_choice**None**29**leaving the cheating athletes>> in professional sports, even after <<a 2 years ban**T20**Category_confusion**None**18**2 years of banning>>, would be <<disrespect**T22**Articles**None**12**a disrespect>> of lifelong work of those, who never used illegal drugs and achieved high <<results**T15**Noun_number**None**6**result>> by their own <<strength**T6**Word_choice**None**6**forces>>. Finally, sportsmen have to be an example for society, especially for youngmen and kids, inspiring them to work hard on their roads to success, so banning drug-using athletes forever could prevent a decrease of moral and motivation <<among**T11**Prepositions**None**7**between>> future generations.
However, every person has a right to make a bad decision someday - we are all people, with our own vices and passions. So those, who are for banning cheating sportsmen for a limited period are also right. This sort of restriction is promoting the humanity, <<which**T16**Spelling**None**4**wich>> is a basic idea of any big competition. It also <<transmits**T7**Word_choice**None**10**translates>> to society a very important idea, that we all have a chance to correct the faults of our past and have <<prospering future**T5**Countable_uncountable**None**19**a prospering future>>.
To conclude, I would like to say that both these views are relevant, but I agree <<with**T13**Spelling**None**5**withe>> the second one. Professional sport competitions, like <<Olympic**T4**Spelling**None**7**Olimpic>> games, are not about winning: they are about being people, wherever you come from and whoever you are. And <<I am**T6**Spelling**None**4**I'am>> pretty sure that there is nothing as important for a human being, than giving each other a chance.
