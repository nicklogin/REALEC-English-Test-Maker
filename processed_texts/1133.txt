Nowadays many #DELETE#9#contreies people prefer to watch <<films**T2**Articles**None**7**a films>> and <<listen to**T3**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> music from illegal pirate copies. There could be serious <<consequences**T4**lex_item_choice**None**6**reason>> that <<producers**T5**Articles**None**13**the producers>> and musicians <<lose**T6**Tense_choice**None**6**losing>> <<their**T7**lex_item_choice**None**5**there>> money. I believe that governments should <<affect**T9**Transitive**None**9**affect to>> people by closing illegal <<resources**T8**Spelling**None**8**resorses>>. 

<<It is**T10**Inappropriate_register**None**4**Itâ€™s>> true that <<the act**T11**Articles**None**3**act>> of making illigal copies of music or movie is a crime which has <<a negative influence**T12**Articles**None**18**negative influence>> on <<society**T13**Articles**None**11**the society>> as a whole and therefore <<serious**T14**lex_item_choice**None**5**heavy>> measures should be taken to tackle  this issue immediately. 

There are some reasons why Internet piracy should be censored by regulation. Firstly, it is unacceptable when a person <<becomes**T15**Agreement_errors**None**6**become>> famous and <<earns**T16**Agreement_errors**None**4**earn>> <<huge amounts of money**T17**Articles**None**23**a huge amounts of money>> from their products such as music videos and paintings thanks to the ideas of other people. Son Tung MTP, for instance, who <<created**T19**lex_item_choice**None**7**bazowec>> the style of many Korean boybands to attract more yong <<fans**T20**Noun_number**None**3**fan>> <<, who do not have enough knowledge about piracy,**T24**Non_defining**None**45**who do not have enough knowledge about piracy>> in order to earn fame may get <<a bad image**T21**Articles**None**9**bad image>> of Vietnamese artists in the eye of international friends. Furthermore, this illegal act may <<affect**T22**lex_item_choice**None**5**deter>> the creativity of the real inventor. 

<<On the other hand,**T23**Punctuation**None**17**On the other hand>> some practical measures can prevent people from online piracy effectively due to technological brakthroughts.
