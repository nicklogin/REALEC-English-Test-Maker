It cannot be denied that nowadays big international companies replace the vast majority of local businesses. Some people think that it is better <<for**T30**Prepositions**None**2**to>> <<them**T31**Punctuation**None**5**them,>> because now they can buy products that are popular in more developed countries <<at**T39**Prepositions**None**4**with>> <<the same**T40**Articles**None**4**same>> quality and <<price**T36**lex_item_choice**None**5**prise>>, but some <<people**T37**Spelling**None**6**peolpe>> claim that this process <<destroys**T38**Inappropriate_register**None**5**kills>> the industry of other <<countries**T32**Punctuation**None**10**countries,>> because the folks have no place to work and they just become unemployed.

On the one hand, big brands really know how to deal with production, how to build big wo<<companies**T41**lex_item_choice**None**5**works>>nd make a lot of products at<<in**T33**Pronouns**None**2**at>>hort time period. It is also be<<better**T42**Spelling**None**7**bettter>>or countries in which those wo<<companies**T43**lex_item_choice**None**5**works>>re located, because many locals can find a job for th<<themselves**T34**Pronouns**None**8**themself>>Moreover, it is easy to control quality in bi<<a big**T35**Articles**None**3**big>>ompany, so you do<<do not**T24**Tense_form**None**3**don>>eed to create many different co<<commissions**T25**Spelling**None**10**comissions>>China can represent th<<an**T44**Articles**None**3**the>>xample of country that was lucky. At the end of the 10<<10th**T5**Quantifiers**None**2**10>>entury big American brands came to th<<China**T6**Articles**None**9**the China>>ith money and built a lot of wo<<companies**T45**lex_item_choice**None**5**works>>o product literally everything. People got jobs and be<<started**T13**Tense_choice**None**6**become>>o<<working**T28**Gerund_phrase**None**7**to work>>Se<<Salaries**T7**Spelling**None**9**Sellaries>>a<<were**T8**Tense_form**None**3**was>>ery small, work was hard, but now China has one of the biggest in<<industrial**T29**Formational_affixes**None**8**industrt>>asement that works very nice and br<<brings**T23**Tense_form**None**5**bring>>h<<Chinese people**T9**Ref_device**None**4**them>> lot of benefits.

But on the other hand, is l<<it**T10**Spelling**None**2**is>>ks not so nice in countries without big work<<companies**T46**lex_item_choice**None**5**works>>ople are not able to find a job. Local businesses cannot race <<compete**T14**lex_item_choice**None**4**race>> international brands, so the h<<they**T11**Spelling**None**3**the>> two unpleasant ways - to be<<either to**T18**Linking_device**None**2**to>>me a part of big brand and send them <<it**T22**Pronouns**None**4**them>>biige<<biggest**T15**Spelling**None**7**biigest>> of the money or leave the market.
For example, Poland's industry was killed<<destroyed**T19**Inappropriate_register**None**6**killed>>e international brands. They u<<The Polish**T20**Ref_device**None**4**They>>to have own in<<their own**T21**Absence_comp_colloc**None**3**own>>e<<independent**T3**Spelling**None**11**independend>>t with huge amount of jobs and normal amound<<amount of**T13**Prepositions**None**6**amound>>cts, but now they have plenty of goods and literally no money to buy someth<<anything**T13**Pronouns**None**10**something,>>se all those products are made in China.

To sum up, big international brands can rocket some country's industry and totally destroy enother'<<another's**T2**Spelling**None**9**enother's>>is really hard to find out if it is ad<<globalization**T50**Ref_device**None**2**it>>ntag<<an advantage**T48**Articles**None**9**advantage>>dvan<<a disadavantage**T49**Articles**None**12**disadvantage>>yway i<<anyway**T12**Spelling**None**6**enyway>>ld be controll<<controled**T51**Tense_form**None**10**controlled>>troll<<controled**T52**Tense_form**None**10**controlled>>l<<very**T13**Spelling**None**4**wery>>
