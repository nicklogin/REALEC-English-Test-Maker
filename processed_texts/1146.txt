There are different opinions on the problem of downloading films and music from the Internet and sharing them there. Some people believe that it is a crime and those who do not pay money for songs and films should pay a fine. However, I think that it is not a serious crime and these people should not be punished. 

Those people <<, who think that downloading music and film is illegal,**T1**Non_defining**None**52**who think that downloading music and film is illegal>> believe that singers or actors work really hard to make a good song or film. Therefore, they should get money for the job they have done and it is not <<fair**T2**Spelling**None**4**fait>> that people use their effort for free. Moreover, people who own and programme <<websites**T3**Spelling**None**9**wevscites>> where people can watch songs or listen to music also should get money because it is difficult to make a good website and supervise it.

However, I think that people who download music from the Internet are not criminals and should not be punished, because it is not a theft, as many singers provide free access to their new songs for their fans. Secondly, musicians and actors get a lot of money because they give concerts or producers <<pay**T7**Spelling**None**3**pat>> them a lot of money.
