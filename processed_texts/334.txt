To begin with, I want to say that the chart illustrates us how the unemployment rate in different countries changes during 2014 and 2015.
As you can see, in North Africa the rate achives the highest peak at 12,5 in both years. South Asiaâ€™s rate is at the bottom. It is only 3,9 percent during 2014 and 2015. In Worldwide the unemployment index remains stable at the point 5,9 percent during the period.
Other regions have differences between 2014 and 2015. Firstly, I want to pay attentiont to Middle East. In 2014 the unemployment rate was really high. It was 11 percent. But in 2015 it dramatically declined and reached the point of 9,6 percent. The same situation you can obvious in Latin America. The index decreased from 6,8 percent to 5,8 percent.
In conclusion I want to notice that in EU is an upward tendency. As you can see, the rate slightly increased during the year from 7,5 percent to 7,9. Besides, only in this region the index rose.
