Nowadays in the period when people are surrounded by different gadgets everywhere: by mobile phones, smartphones, comuputers and so on, it is very popular opinion that all of these gadgets haue very bad affect on people's health and they can be reason for different health problems and desiases.
I agree with this opinion, because it is really truth which was claimed by different scientists that, for example, mobile phones haue very bad impact on people's health. Person who always takes mobile phone in his pocket has a risk to get cancer and some other dangerous desiases when he will be old. Another ond the most obvious example of bad impact of modern technologies is fact that more than half of the population of the World have to wear glasses to improue their vision abilities. It happened because a lot of people spend their free time using computers and watching TV. Because of these reasons eyes lose its abiity to see uery good on long distances.
Also it is widespreded opinion that computer games haue very bad impact on psychological abilities of person. There are a lot of examples all ouer the world when persons lost the difference between the game and reality.
In conclusion, it is obvious that new technologies not only improve our lifes and make it easieu but also haue bad side and can be reason for dangerous desiases like cancer and so on.
So people all around the world should think about future and use products of new technologies rational.
