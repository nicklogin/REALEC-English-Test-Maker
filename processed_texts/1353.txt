Many argued that the #DELETE#14#development of using modern technology widely <<leads**T2**Agreement_errors**None**4**lead>> to <<the increasing number**T74**Articles**None**4**rise>> #DELETE#9#of amount of problems with health. In <<the essay**T6**Articles**None**5**essay>> I will <<write about**T7**lex_item_choice**None**4**show>> <<these**T8**Ref_device**None**4**this>> health problems and try to find a solution <<for**T9**Prepositions**None**2**of>> <<them**T10**Ref_device**None**2**it>>.

It is true that <<the widespread use**T12**Articles**None**14**widespread use>> of <<technologies**T13**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> in modern wourld can cause many health problems. Every person nowdays <<facing**T14**Transitive**None**11**facing with>> these problems. People <<put themselves**T15**Word_order**None**14**themselves put>> <<in**T16**Prepositions**None**4**into>> <<a place**T17**Articles**None**5**place>> <<full of**T18**lex_item_choice**None**11**surrounding>> by gadgets and other products of modern <<technologies**T19**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>. Our world is full of various waves<< produced**T20**Punctuation**None**10**, produced>> by technical devices. And they dramatically <<influence**T22**Transitive**None**13**influenced on>> us and our health. For example, micro waves can lead to <<a cancer**T24**Articles**None**6**cancer>> if someone <<stays**T25**lex_item_choice**None**7**located>> for a long time near some machines (or something different) that <<makes**T26**Tense_choice**None**6**making>> these waves. <<Furthermore,**T27**Punctuation**None**11**Furthermore>> our workplace #DELETE#13#in many cases reduces our health/ <<Too much**T29**lex_item_choice**None**4**Long>> sitting and working with <<the computer**T30**Articles**None**8**computer>> without <<a break**T31**Articles**None**5**break>> and #DELETE#6#taking special <<exercises**T33**Spelling**None**7**exerces>> can <<spoil**T34**Spelling**None**6**spoilt>> <<someone's ability**T35**Possessive**None**17**someone's ability>> to see, because #DELETE#3#put eyes are not prepared for this <<hard work**T38**lex_item_choice**None**8**hardship>>.

There are various ways to solve such problems. Firstly, people should start from themselves, they actually need to <<start to want**T39**Absence_explanation**None**4**want>> to solve the problem. Humanity must always think about their own safety. We must remember all <<consequences**T40**Spelling**None**12**consequanses>> of using technologies. For instance, <<have**T41**Tense_choice**None**6**having>> a break every 30 minutes while working on the computer and <<do**T42**Tense_choice**None**5**doing>> special <<exercises**T43**Spelling**None**7**exerces>> for eyes. <<Also,**T44**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> people can change their place of living <<once**T45**Spelling**None**3**onc>> a year for relax from <<the influence**T47**Articles**None**9**influence>> of <<technologies**T48**Spelling**None**12**technolodies>>. Cities <<are**T49**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> full of this harmful influence and we can <<go**T52**lex_item_choice**None**4**move>> to <<a countryside**T50**Articles**None**11**countryside>> <<from time to time**T51**lex_item_choice**None**9**sometimes>>. <<Secondly,**T53**Punctuation**None**8**Secondly>> our government should improve <<the health care**T54**Articles**None**11**health care>> of their <<citizens**T55**Spelling**None**7**citines>> according to <<the appearance**T74**Spelling**None**11**appeareance>> of <<a new damage**T58**Articles**None**10**new damage>> from <<technologies**T59**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>. Sometimes <<a government**T61**Articles**None**10**government>> <<do not**T60**Inappropriate_register**None**5**donâ€™t>> introduce health education, which is a very <<important**T62**Often_confused**None**7**crucial>> #DELETE#3#way to solve problems caused by modern <<technologies**T64**Noun_number**None**10**technology>>.

There are actually many problems<< that**T65**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<are produced**T74**lex_item_choice**None**8**creating>> by modern devices. But <<also**T74**Spelling**None**3**lso>> people can prevent the <<appearance**T70**Spelling**None**10**appearence>> of problems <<and government**T71**Conjunctions**None**10**government>> <<plays**T72**Spelling**None**4**plsy>> <<a great role**T73**Articles**None**10**great role>> in <<this**T74**Ref_device**None**2**it>>.
