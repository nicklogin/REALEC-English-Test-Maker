The figures illustrate how the goods were transported internationally in the <<Eastern Europe**T1**Prepositions**None**14**East of Europe>> in 2008. It is clear that rails and roads were used differently. 
Almost one third of goods transported by rail was <<for metals**T2**Prepositions**None**6**metals>>, while only 11% of transportation by road was occupied by metals. The percentage of manufactured goods was nearly the same in both cases, 25% and 28% respectively. What is also seen is that for transporting machinery rail was used more often, because machinery made up 12% of all goods transported by this <<mean**T3**Noun_number**None**5**means>> of transport. Metals are also transported by rail in most cases, with the percentage of 35 among all other goods.
As for transportation by road, it is mostly used for food products, manufactured goods, chemicals and non-metallic minerals. All mentioned figures are higher, compared to the ones transported by rail. The difference in <<the transportation of food products**T4**Prepositions**None**28**food products transportation>> is the most significant, since it is 19%. The part of transported chemicals is 5% more than in using rail.
To conclude, it is obvious that for some reasons various goods can be transported either by rail or by road.
