The charts given <<show**T1**Agreement_errors**None**5**shows>> the information about the transportation of goods in Eastern Europe in 2008 by means of rail transport and road transport. 

As we can see, the main product #DELETE#5#to be transported by rail are metals, they take more than a third of the whole count. At the same time there are three times less metals transported by roads. Manufactured goods and food products are the main <<cargoes**T3**Spelling**None**5**cargo>> for the road <<transportation**T4**Noun_number**None**15**transportations>>, differing only <<by two percents**T5**Prepositions**None**15**in two percents>> in favour of foods. While <<the quantity**T7**Articles**None**8**quantity>> of manufactured goods is almost the same on railroads as it is on roads, 25 and 28 percent respectively, road transport carries almost thrice as much food products. 

Non-metallic minerals take the last place in railroad <<cargoes**T8**Spelling**None**5**cargo>>, counting only 6 percent and the road <<transportation**T9**lex_item_choice**None**9**transport>> carries twice as much. Also, while machinery takes 12 percent of rails total <<it is**T10**Inappropriate_register**None**4**itâ€™s>> <<transported**T11**Tense_choice**None**17**being transported>> only by 2 percent of the road machines, working the last place in their chart.
