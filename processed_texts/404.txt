Nowadays many people consider watching sports to be a quite useless activity regardless of the way it is done; either on TV or by visiting live sport events. This essay will express a point of disagreement with the issue presented. First of all, I would like to provide a brief overview, and, after that, I will add my personal standpoint.

To begin with, it is fair to mention the fact that doing sport in general can be regarded as a rather time-consuming hobby as well as simple watching games and matches.The tendency towards such a 'passive' way of participating is growing more and more popular, which has led to a great amount of agrument; whether it is worth doing at all. I adhere to the point that being involved into the world of sport even by just supporting your favorite teams may have a number of advantages. The first reason to support the idea is that people become more and more aware of the news connected with the particular area. In the long run, followers are likely to turn into active participants since they already have not only a practical constituent, but also a sufficient theoretical basis.
Moreover, sport events seem to be a really widespead topic for a heated discussion, which beneficially contributes to the development of social skills.
To sum up, it should be pointed out that people are provided with quite prospective opportunities when watching games and being a spectator at a stadium, even though it is sometimes acknowledged to be of no use.
