The #DELETE#14#illegal piracy copyright policies <<have always been**T1**Standard**None**16**have been always>> <<a crucial issue**T42**Articles**None**13**crucial issue>> in XX and XXI centuries. I totally agree that musicians and producers have been getting <<huge amounts**T3**Articles**None**14**a huge amounts>> of #DELETE#7#lots of money while <<the**T6**Word_choice**None**5**there>> piracy <<was flourishing**T5**Tense_form**None**11**flourishing>>. From my own perspective, I <<think**T43**lex_item_choice**None**8**consider>> that the overwhelming and tremendous job of <<the creators**T7**Articles**None**8**creators>> should be respected and copyright <<policies**T44**Noun_number**None**6**policy>> strictly <<complied with**T8**Prepositional_verb**None**8**complied>>. We should understand that musicians and movie producers <<spend**T45**Tense_choice**None**10**have spent>> <<a tremendous amount of time**T9**Absence_explanation**None**17**a tremendous time>> and <<budget money**T46**Absence_comp_colloc**None**6**budget>> in order to bring <<their**T47**Word_choice**None**4**this>> <<masterpieces**T48**Noun_number**None**11**masterpiece>> into real life.

Nothing can be free! If you <<think that**T33**Prepositional_verb**None**5**think>> others produce for free <<then**T10**lex_item_choice**None**4**than>> you have to do the same thing work <<for free**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**free>><<.**T11**Punctuation**None**1**?>> However, <<a human's**T50**Articles**None**7**humanâ€™s>> <<ego**T14**lex_item_choice**None**11**self-egoism>> <<only wants**T16**Standard**None**10**wants only>> <<them**T52**lex_item_choice**None**3**him>> being paid and <<others**T51**Possessive**None**6**others>> labor for free. Therefore, <<releasing**T15**Spelling**None**8**relasing>> <<pirate**T40**Category_confusion**None**6**piracy>> copies and downloading <<creators**T17**Possessive**None**8**creators>> works for free form <<untrustworthy**T18**Word_choice**None**4**left>> online pages brings a great harm <<, and**T59**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<may even**T21**Standard**None**8**even may>> prevent <<future**T39**Articles**None**8**a future>> #DELETE#4#best products from <<being made**T19**lex_item_choice**None**9**occurring>> <<, since the creators would be lost in a previous one and would have no intention to make another**T54**Conditionals**None**87**since the creators are lost in a previous one and have no intention to make another one>>. 

Unfortunately, in our country the fight against piracy is not well established or well developed in #DELETE#3#the comparison with west countries such as <<the EU**T58**Articles**None**2**EU>> or North America<<.**T53**Punctuation**None**1**,>> In our <<daily**T25**Spelling**None**5**dauly>> life we can #DELETE#2#be witness #DELETE#2#of many our <<friends**T28**Noun_number**None**6**friend>> who are occuped with #DELETE#6#piracy downloading of <<pirate movies or music**T29**Absence_explanation**None**15**movies or music>>. From my perspective, we have to use #DELETE#4#soft <<the power**T37**Articles**None**5**power>> #DELETE#5#point of punishment and get people fined #DELETE#6#police for <<the**T32**Determiners**None**4**that>> actions that can be <<unbeneficial**T38**Coherence**None**10**beneficial>> for both #DELETE#3#for the government and the producers of <<the**T33**lex_item_choice**None**4**thus>> masterpieces.
