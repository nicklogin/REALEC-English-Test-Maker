There is no doubt that nowadays we live in a very hectic world and some young people have bad manners and habits. One of the most serious problems is <<crime**T10**Articles**None**7**a crime>> among teens.However, there are several ways of solving this particular issue. Now I am going to demonstrate 3 of them.

Firstly, parents should educate their children from the earliest childhood very properly. They have to explain what is the crime, what children are forbidden to do, how can they be punished. For example, parents of Artem who is 5 years old punished him very strictly for taking a toy( car) from another boy in a kindergarden. Thanks to this action from pa<<parents,**T11**Punctuation**None**7**parents>>rtem understood that he does have to give the toy back to the boy and, moreover, never should do it again.

Secondly, teachers can help avoid the growth and even decline of the crime among young people by providing them with certain know<<knowledge**T12**Countable_uncountable**None**10**knowledges>>ere is no difficulties in including lessons about the harm of this problem into school shcedule. For instance, the lesson can be called 'crime and punishment'( as the name of Dost<<Dostoevsky's**T13**Possessive**None**10**Dostoevsky>>k) and srtict rules and thin<<matters**T9**lex_item_choice**None**5**thing>>t are forbidden should bete<<be taught**T16**Participial_constr**None**9**beteached>>re. It would not be bad to read and talk about the book at this lesson too. It is a reallly worth-discussing theme.


Furthermore,the most efficient way for parents and teather<<teachers**T17**Spelling**None**8**teathers>>e the world better and safer for their children is to cooperate and do their best to protect teens together. It can be done by methods that i have <<i**T18**Capitalisation**None**1**i>>escreb<<described**T19**Tense_form**None**10**descrebied>> In addition, they can show what happens to people who did suc<<has made**T9**Tense_choice**None**3**did>> silly mistake in their lives and what consequ<<consequences**T4**Spelling**None**12**consequances>>eceive<<have received**T20**Tense_choice**None**8**received>> pris<<serving time in prison**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**the prison>>, no family, no education) As an example, we can imagine life of the corr<<a corruptionist**T7**Articles**None**17**the corruptionist>>t everything after revealing his bussines<<business**T8**Spelling**None**9**bussiness>> up, the more parents and teachers do, the better life will be in future<<in the future**T9**Articles**None**9**in future>>
