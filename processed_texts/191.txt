A lot of people nowadays copy and share music and films through the Internet, so other people have an opportunity to download it for free, instead of spending time and money by buying the original versions of <<these**T1**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> products.
I completely disagree with this point of view on this global problem. Firstly, new albums of famous <<music**T2**Category_confusion**None**8**musician>> groups could cost a lot of money for the first time after the <<release of it**T3**Noun_attribute**None**10**release it>> to the market. So, not all people could <<afford**T4**lex_item_choice**None**5**allow>> to buy it. So, the only way to get it is to download through the Internet.
Secondly, because of some reasons you are not able to find your favorite <<music**T5**Category_confusion**None**8**musician>> disc or film in the market, but you can find this material <<on**T6**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the specific sites, like Torrents. So, you have an opportunity to spend less time <<for**T7**Prepositions**None**2**in>> operations of getting necessary product. 
From my experience, I <<have been using**T9**Tense_choice**None**4**used>> sites with illegal pirate copies <<for**T8**Prepositions**None**2**by>> approximately four or five years and could find and download a lot of films, music and video games for free. And there are <<a few**T10**Often_confused**None**3**few>> million people<< that**T12**Defining**None**6**, that>> <<do**T30**Tense_choice**None**5**doing>> the same things every day <<, even despite**T15**Punctuation**None**12**even despite>> the fact, that these pirate sites <<have**T16**Tense_choice**None**3**had>> been <<closed**T17**Suffix**None**6**closen>> by the government.
Thirdly, it is more <<convenient**T18**Spelling**None**10**convinient>> to download files on the PC and not to collect a lot of unnecessary <<discs**T32**Spelling**None**6**disces>> in your room.
So, the government should legalize this type of copying and sharing <<music**T19**Category_confusion**None**8**musician>> and <<film**T20**Word_choice**None**11**filmography>> products, because it is more available for <<almost**T21**lex_item_choice**None**6**mostly>> all citizens of the country. And the government <<don't have to**T22**Modals**None**7**mustn’t>> punish them because of the fact <<that**T23**Defining**None**5**that,>> they don’t buy original discs. For this reason, government should create a few special sites and take <<it**T24**Pronouns**None**3**its>> under their control.
To summarize, people<< who**T25**Defining**None**5**, who>> use <<those**T26**Determiners**None**5**these>> types of sites should be punished only if the government legalize these sites. So, after that all persons <<will be able to**T27**Modals**None**5**could>> get a legal access to these products. If government doesn’t do such things, the sites should be <<closed**T28**Spelling**None**7**clothed>> and all the creators of the sites should be punished. But, <<in**T29**Prepositions**None**3**for>> my opinion, it would be efficient for all citizens in the county<< if**T31**Punctuation**None**4**, if>> the pirate sites would be <<allow**T30**Transitive**None**11**allowed for>> them.
