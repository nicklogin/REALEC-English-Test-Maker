Crime is an issue of <<an increasing concern**T1**Articles**None**18**increasing concern>> in the modern world. Even more dangerous is the alarming tendency of rising youth crime cases. This might stand for growing anxiety in the society and <<respect for the law**T2**Category_confusion**None**15**law’s - respect>> by non-adults. As possible effects of this trend I can mention social unstability and lack of <<intelligent**T3**Spelling**None**11**intellegent>> human resourses in <<the future**T4**Articles**None**6**future>>. Though there are people<< who should guide their children**T5**Defining**None**33**, who should guide their children>> #DELETE#3#and <<in order to prevent catastrophic damages to the future of humanity and next generations**T6**Coherence**None**93**in order to prevent catastrophic damages to humanity in terms of dangerous coming generations>>.
To eliminate the problem and stop this unhealthy crime wave, we must find out reasons for it. In my opinion there are two main causes: historical and psychological. A century ago, people of my age <<would have been working**T9**Tense_form**Dependent_change**17**have been working>> full time <<for 5 years already**T10**Tense_form**Dependent_change**11**for 5 years>>. The usage of children’s hands in manufacturing, farms had been widely spread unlike education and equal rights: <<prosperous**T11**Spelling**None**11**prosperious>> families could afford to send their <<children**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**4**kids>> to schools while carpenter’s children began to work from very young age. Nowadays the situation has changed and young people do not have to earn money since they are physically ready to. Thus, more freedom resulted in less control and young people began to use their time for <<committing**T13**Spelling**None**9**commiting>> crimes also. Being supported by families and sometimes by the government, <<children**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**4**kids>> feel protected and might look for some interesting activities <<outside**T15**lex_item_choice**None**7**besides>> <<the school**T16**Articles**None**6**school>>, which is a psychological reason for them to do something illegal.
Crime is an action of <<disobedience**T17**Suffix**None**11**disobeyment>> and representation of <<a person's**T18**Articles**None**8**person’s>> disagreement with given rules or his <<life's**T19**Possessive**None**4**life>> circumstances. In <<adolescents**T22**Noun_number**None**12**adolescent’s>> souls <<rebellious**T20**Spelling**None**9**rebelious>> thoughts are growing. If not carefully guided, their flame and energy will go away and burn everything down. So, parents and teachers as main advisors should take care of young people. They must create a comfortable environment and atmosphere of love to make them feel good. Relationships in family are the most important thing <<determining**T23**Spelling**None**9**determing>> <<young people's**T24**Possessive**None**7**young’s>> <<behaviour**T25**Spelling**Dependent_change**9**beheviour>> in future, so parents shoud behave respectfully to their <<child's**T26**Possessive**None**5**child>> <<thoughts**T27**Spelling**None**7**thoughs>> and personality as well as teachers.
To conclude, young crimes are upsurging, which is a problem leading to serious negative effects on the society. Because of freedom spreading teenagers <<began to feel allmighty and to do**T28**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**30**began to feel allmighty and do>> everything they want. To prevent this <<behaviour**T29**Spelling**Dependent_change**8**behavior>> parents and teachers should do everything to contact with children in a good and tolerant way.
