Today in our modern word we have got a lot of problems which are connected with a sport industry. One of the most serious is the use of illegal drugs by the athletes. Some people believes that is something terrible and that using of illegal drugs it is like the end of the career. But another part of people says that banned period should be something temporary for athletes.
To begin with, I'd like to write that the use of illegal drugs it is something incorrect and, of course, athletes have to be banned. I'm agree only with the statement that they shoud be limited only for some period, not for the rest of their lives. I think so because, firt of all, using of illegal drungs doesn't mentioned that this athlet is a terrible sportmen.
This limited period it is like an educational process and after that athlet can shows better results that before this periode. Moreover, we don't know the motive of using these drugs. It can be not what the sportsmen wants. And so limite him or her for the rest of their lives it is something strange and stupid. On another hand, people that were banned before, can start use illegal drugs one more time and take part in competitions. It is the biggest problem.
To conclude, I'd like to write that, of course, athletes have to be banned because of using illegal drugs. But we donâ€™t know correctly the motive of their decision; the character of person: if she or he continues using drugs after the end of this limited period. It is depend on person. But I am agree that athletes should be banned from competing professionally for a limited period.
