Modern technologies include huge amount of different items and definitions, but there is one thing<< which**T1**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> has totally changed our live, it is <<the gadgets**T2**Articles**None**7**gadgets>>. Among widespread problems <<like**T3**Spelling**None**4**live>> vision problems, troubles with sleep, headaches and even obesity <<the most important one**T5**Absence_explanation**None**18**the most important>> <<is**T4**lex_item_choice**None**5**seems>> that technologies enter deeply in our brain and psychological sphere. Modern people <<cannot**T6**Spelling**None**7**can not>> do #DELETE#6#almost simple things without robots: cleaning, washing up or just talking, people stopped <<communication**T8**Tense_choice**None**11**communicate>> in life <<, they**T9**Punctuation**None**4**they>> are always in their phones, creating <<an illusion**T10**Articles**None**8**illusion>> of communication.

The best way to reduce those effects is <<to reduce**T11**Infinitive_constr**None**6**reduce>> <<the amount**T12**Articles**None**6**amount>> of time and activities<< where**T13**Punctuation**None**7**, where>> we use gadgets, for example, we can just change <<an electric book**T14**Articles**None**13**electric book>> for real, feel <<its**T15**Spelling**None**4**it’s>> smell and enjoy touching #DELETE#2#of <<the pages**T17**Articles**None**5**pages>> or turn off our phone for 30 minutes before going to bed to sleep better. We have to understand that real life consist from <<people's**T18**Possessive**None**6**people>> emotions and other things we can feel, but not from wi-fi and videogames. 

To conclude, modern <<technologies**T19**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> are <<an important part**T20**Articles**None**18**the important part>> of our life <<, and**T21**Punctuation**None**3**and>> like all things in the worlds <<they have**T22**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**have>> bad effects. So, we should reduce <<the amount**T23**lex_item_choice**None**4**part>> of <<them**T24**Ref_device**None**2**it>> in our day. In other case we will be suffer from <<the lack**T25**Articles**None**4**lack>> of activity and someday become heroes of cartoon “Valli” about humanity living in space. They <<are uncapable**T26**Voice**None**9**uncapable>> even to go by themselves and <<recieve all things**T27**Standard**None**18**all things receive>> through technologies.
