The internet users getting pirate versions of the media product <<instead of**T1**Prepositions**None**7**despite>> paying for the legal ones should #DELETE#4#also be restricted by the government. I utterly agree with such a point of view.
To begin with, internet piracy <<is regarded as**T3**lex_item_choice**None**10**belongs to>> a <<crime**T2**lex_item_choice**None**9**crimerate>>. In this <<case**T4**lex_item_choice**None**3**way>>, people who buy <<its**T5**Spelling**None**4**it’s>> production support online robbers and provide them with money. So they become the participants of the illegal act. Moreover, such <<purchasers**T294**Spelling**None**10**purchasors>> increase the social acceptance of these unjustified <<actions**T6**lex_item_choice**None**9**accidents>>. So the number of pirates and their clients has been consistently rising.
After that, why should producers invest in media when their profit has been permanently decreasing? In essence, the public just <<takes**T7**Agreement_errors**None**4**take>> their money. If such a tendency continues, then people <<will limit**T8**Tense_choice**None**5**limit>> their investments, there will appear a lack of financial resources and the quality of products will dramatically drop. This <<means that**T9**that_clause**None**5**means>> illegal buyers damage economic and cultural spheres in general.
By the way, nowadays governments tend to start punishing <<online actions breaking the law**T10**Standard**None**31**breaking the law online actions>>. It relates to posts and <<sites**T11**Spelling**None**5**cites>> in social networks. <<Violating**T293**lex_item_choice**None**8**Breaking>> <<the rights**T297**Articles**None**6**rights>> of the investors is also a crime. So if the government punishes <<some**T12**lex_item_choice**None**3**one>> illegal actions why doesn’t it do the same to the <<others**T296**Derivation**None**5**other>>. That is <<an ease**T13**Articles**None**4**ease>> of unjustice.
All in all, internet users who buy pirate products <<violate**T295**lex_item_choice**None**5**break>> the rights of the official dealers and steal their money. It is <<probably**T16**Category_confusion**None**8**probable>> #DELETE#5#to be a << collapse**T14**lex_item_choice**None**4**drop>> of the media industry. So the goverment should <<maintain**T298**lex_item_choice**None**6**follow>> <<justice**T301**Articles**None**11**the justice>> and support the producers.
