On the given histogram we can see the percentage of adults inhabitants of the USA who use various social services divided by ages, from the youngest (18-29) to the oldest (65+). Using this information I can make interesting conclusios.
First of all, it is brightly presented that the old use sociall networks less, than the young. We can see it most vividly on the example of Instagram. 53% of the young (18-29) use it and at the same time only 6% of the old (65+) prefer this network. It is also important to highlight that there is a solid tendency: the older the person is, the less probably he or she spends time on Facebook or Instagram.
My second important observation is that there is no big difference by age in groups of people using LinkedIn. Surprisingly, middle-aged people (30-49 and 50-64) use LinkedIn a but more frequent than the young or the old (31% and 30% vs 22% and 22% respectively)
Last but not least I want to pay attention to the volume of users of the three given social networks. Clearly, any age group uses Facebook more often, than Instagram or Linkedin. Even the minor group of Facebook users (people aged 65+) is 56% whereas only 53% of the people aged 18-29 use Instagram and they are the major group of Instagram users.
