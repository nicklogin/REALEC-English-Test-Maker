It is argued that nowadays the severe problem of human beings is modern technology. This essay will discuss some of health problems caused by technology and then will look for some ways that could help to reduce them.

It is <<a commont knowledge**T1**Articles**None**16**common knowledge>> that <<modern**T2**lex_item_choice**None**5**today>> people, both children and adults, are keen on spending all their free time in the Internet. Gadgets such as mobile phones, laptops and personal computers are the main part of modern technology. That part which <<increases**T3**Agreement_errors**None**8**increase>> <<the number**T4**Articles**None**6**number>> of health problems, not only <<physical**T5**Spelling**None**7**fisical>>, but also mental. For example, people start wearing glasses <<in**T6**Prepositions**None**2**at>> very young ages. #DELETE#14#In reason that nowadays people <<prefer to buy**T8**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**10**prefer buy>> food and clothes online rather <<than**T9**Often_confused**None**4**then>> go to the nearest shop <<, and**T10**Conjunctions**None**4**they>> become fat. They start to be afraid of sweating, doing sport, going to a fitness <<club**T11**lex_item_choice**None**7**centers>> because their friends from social sites are going to laugh. Another example, there is a steady deterioration in real meatings and talking face-to-face. People lose some <<essential**T12**Spelling**None**8**issentia>>l skills. 

Government should reduce the number of sites<< that exist today**T13**Defining**None**18**, that exist today>>. People will not be able to order mild or a new skirt from Internet if there is no online <<shops**T15**Spelling**None**5**shope>>. <<It**T16**Ref_device**None**4**This>> has to be illegal to allow children to use phones. They make them lazy, less self-motivated.

Overall, it is really a big problem to live in time of the technology, we <<ourselves**T17**Spelling**None**9**orurselve>> have to.
