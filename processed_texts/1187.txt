Some people believe that <<countries**T1**Spelling**None**7**countis>> should import food as little as possible and aim for food wich was produced in <<their own**T2**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**their>> country for their own population eats. I agree with this statement and <<I would**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**3**I’d>> like to give some arguments for it.  

At first, if <<a country**T4**Articles**None**7**country>> <<produced**T5**Conditionals**None**7**produce>> food by <<itself**T6**Ref_device**None**10**yourselves>>, <<it**T7**Ref_device**None**3**she>> <<would have**T8**Conditionals**None**4**have>> food independence from other countries. So, if one country <<would need**T9**Tense_form**None**13**would be need>> to cut relations with another country, it <<would be**T10**Conditionals**None**7**will be>> <<easier**T11**Comparative_adj**None**9**to easier>>, <<because**T12**Spelling**None**6**becous>> other country <<cannot**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**6**cann’t>> have <<an impact**T14**Articles**None**6**impact>> for us.
