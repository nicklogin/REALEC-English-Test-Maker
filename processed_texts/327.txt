There is a burning question <<about**T26**Prepositions**None**5**withe>> the situation of <<stealing films and music**T4**Confusion_of_structures**Dependent_change**24**films and music stealing>>. Videos and music albums are in free access on torrents, pirate forums, <<the Darknet**T26**Capitalisation**None**7**darknet>>. Almost everyone can download it<< thus**T8**Punctuation**None**6**, thus>> leaving the author with less income than he could make. I am against such a #DELETE#3#can consuming behaviour.
Nowadays the most developed countries have post-industrial economies <<, which**T26**Non_defining**None**5**which>> <<are**T11**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> called informational at the same time. The outcomes of our <<intellectual properties**T14**Word_choice**None**16**brain production>> are especially <<valuable**T13**lex_item_choice**None**6**worthy>> there. <<With regards to songs and movies,**T15**Punctuation**None**32**With regards to songs and movies>> there are the same rules #DELETE#2#to which technologies and material results of ideas obey: they should be paid. Therefore, any means that help to avoid respecting the creator’s right must be <<restricted**T17**lex_item_choice**None**7**limited>>.
Nevertheless, even some authors, musicians and <<filmmakers**T18**Punctuation**None**11**filmmakers,>> consider it acceptable to share and distribute their arts for free. As a rule, they have a definite <<goal**T19**lex_item_choice**None**6**target>> – to tell the world about <<an existence**T20**Articles**None**9**existence>> of their music and films and <<, consequently,**T21**Punctuation**None**12**consequently>> become famous. <<For those people**T23**Absence_comp_sent**None**9**For those>> the Internet is an ideal <<place**T22**lex_item_choice**None**3**way>> to find fans and followers.
In summary, the consumer must #DELETE#8#give the give the author an opportunity to make money <<while**T25**Conjunctions**None**5**until>> the second one has a desire to make a present to the world by <<himself**T26**Derivation**None**4**self>>.
