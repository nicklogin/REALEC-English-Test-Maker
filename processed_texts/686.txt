It is believed that the airplanes are one of the most comfortable and safe way of travellings. But, of course, such kind of transport (like every kind of transport) leads to some ecological problems.This essay will discuss, if it is really necessary to decrease the amount of air travelling.
First of all, airplanes are not the only reason of enviromental pollution. The gazes from the automobiles and trains also makes our air worse.I was perplexed when I saw how much the mess is left after the cars' drivers near the autoroutes. The colour of the grass and leaves of the trees near some big roads is grey, not green. But, unfortunately, it is impossible to use only bikes and other ecological types of transport, because nowadays all the people depend on the speed of cars, they have no time for slow walking.
Moreover, I think, that if the goverment introduce laws, which will decline the amount of air travels, people will start to make some meetings. The airplanes give us the opportunity to travel fast, we can visit the conuntries, which are placed in different parts of our planet. Of course, for long transfers we cannot use the handmade planes with the peddals.
In conclusion, I agree that air travellings lead to air pollution and global warming. But it is not the only cause of such problems, we have to respect our nature and try to save it. But I think that somewhen people will destroy our planet.
