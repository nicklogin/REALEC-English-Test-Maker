The pie charts <<illustrate**T1**Agreement_errors**None**11**illustrates>> <<the proportions**T22**Noun_number**None**10**proportion>> of goods transported by rail and road in 2008 in the <<Eastern**T4**Category_confusion**None**4**East>> part of Europe.

All in all, the main tendency is that there are significant changes in <<the percentages**T22**Noun_number**None**10**percentage>> of food products, metals and machinery <<, although,**T7**Punctuation**None**8**although>> <<manufactured**T8**Spelling**None**12**fanufactured>> goods remain <<in the second position**T9**Absence_comp_colloc**None**19**the second position>> in both charts.

As it could be seen from the charts, metals are usually transported by <<trains**T10**Noun_number**None**5**train>> and <<count**T11**Agreement_errors**None**6**counts>> about 35% of all goods <<in contrast to**T12**Prepositional_noun**None**16**in contrast with>> only 11% of food <<products**T13**Noun_number**None**7**product>>, however, <<the proportion**T14**Articles**None**10**proportion>> changes dramatically <<in**T15**Prepositions**None**2**on>> <<the road chart**T16**Articles**None**10**road chart>>: 11% and 30% respectively. It is clear<< that**T17**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<the proportions of manufactured goods**T18**Absence_explanation**None**18**manufactured goods>> remain stable and change only for about 3%.

The more detailed <<look to**T19**Prepositions**None**7**look on>> the graph <<reveals**T20**lex_item_choice**None**5**shows>> that machinery transportation by rail counts 12% in contrast with only 2% in the second chart. Non-metallic minerals and chemicals are more transported by road. There are no information on non-metallic minerals but it is clear that <<the percentage**T21**Articles**None**10**percentage>> <<had risen**T22**Tense_choice**None**8**had rose>>.
