The charts below illustrate <<the changes in**T1**Category_confusion**None**8**changing>> maximum and minimum temperatures during one year in Yakutsk in Russia and in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. 

First of all, at the start of <<the period**T2**Articles**None**6**period>> <<the temperature**T3**Articles**None**11**temperature>> in Yakutsk in Russia <<as**T4**Conjunctions**None**3**and>> in the end of period was minimal. <<By contrast,**T34**Prepositions**None**11**In contrast>> in Rio de Janeiro in that period from January to March and from November to December <<the average temperature**T7**Articles**None**19**average temperature>> was maximal. Turning to average temperatures in Yakutsk, it had the greatest growth #DELETE#19#with temperature up from -40*C to just under 20*C. <<Also,**T9**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> we can <<see that**T10**Punctuation**None**9**see, that>> #DELETE#6#graphs <<both minimum and maximum**T12**Absence_explanation**None**19**maximum and minimum>> temperatures <<change**T13**Tense_choice**None**8**changing>> in some way. Despite <<the sharply increase of temperatures in Yakutsk**T14**Word_order**None**48**average temperatures in Yakutsk sharply increase>> in Summer, <<temperatures are**T15**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**temperatures>> in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil still bigger than in Yakutsk. <<Moreover,**T16**Punctuation**None**8**Moreover>> temperatures in Rio de Janeiro <<are**T17**Tense_form**None**5**being>> the highest <<, but**T18**Punctuation**None**3**but>> it remained steady throughout the year. <<The average temperature**T19**Articles**None**19**Average temperature>> in Yakutsk reached a peak in July (about 10 and 20*C) <<respectively**T20**Category_confusion**None**10**respective>>, <<at the same time**T21**lex_item_choice**None**12**in some time>>, <<the temperature**T22**Articles**None**11**temperature>> in Rio de Janeiro slightly <<decreased**T23**Tense_choice**None**8**decrease>>). 

To sum up, average temperatures in Yakutsk rise very quickly and reached <<a peak**T24**Articles**None**4**peak>> in Jule and then dramatically <<decreased**T25**Tense_choice**None**8**decrease>> to <<the lowest temperature**T26**Articles**None**18**lowest temperature>>. <<In consrast,**T27**Punctuation**None**11**In contrast>> in Brazil <<the temperature**T28**Articles**None**11**temperature>> <<goes**T29**Agreement_errors**None**2**go>> up in <<winter**T30**Capitalisation**None**6**Winter>> months and <<decreases**T31**lex_item_choice**None**9**declining>> in <<summer**T32**Capitalisation**None**6**Summer>>, but during the period <<the changes**T33**Articles**None**7**changes>> <<were**T34**Agreement_errors**None**3**was>> stable
