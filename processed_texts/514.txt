Nowadays, with the rapidly growing population of our planet, the question of where one can find a place to <<live**T2**lex_item_choice**None**4**lead>> a prosperous <<life**T1**Often_confused**None**4**live>> is becoming more and more relevant. One of the most agreed-upon possible solutions to this problem comes from space travel and space colonization. However, as always, there is a huge debate on whether this problem is urgent enough <<or our government should spent its money on more pressing issues like poverty and world pollution instead**T3**Standard**None**105**or should our government instead spent its money on more pressing issues like poverty and world pollution>>.
As for me, I firmly believe that space exploration is deeply b<<beneficial**T6**Spelling**None**10**benefitial>>to our society and should not be swept under the carpet in f<<favour**T7**Spelling**None**5**favor>>of working on other problems of modern society. The first argument in f<<favour**T8**Spelling**None**5**favor>>of that, in my opinion, is that with space travel comes an age of technical advancement, which, i<<in its turn**T9**Absence_comp_colloc**None**7**in turn>> causes some i<<issues that need to**T344**Absence_explanation**None**11**problems to>>become more m<<manageable**T341**Spelling**None**9**managable>> Secondly, w<<with the colonization of other planets**T10**Punctuation**None**39**with the colonization of other planets,>>the number of opportunities for making money should skyrocket. It is even possible that a lot of civilians, as opposed to scientists, will find new ways of doing some things or even make a major discovery, thus causing their names to be f<<remembered forever**T339**Standard**None**18**forever remembered>> Moreover, space travel is a fairly recent dream, while such problems as poverty w<<have already been experienced**T337**Tense_choice**None**24**were already experienced>>for as long as thousands of years into the past. With that in mind, why should we even pay so much attention to these problems, if they have long proved themselves to be unsolvable?
Overall, I can ce<<certainly**T11**Spelling**None**10**certainlly>>ee why some people and even politicians consider space exploration a waste of time and money, however, all things considered, such view is extremely near-sighted and can cause a great number of problems in the long run.
