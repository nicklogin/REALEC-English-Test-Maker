Problem of crimes is one of the most important for every state, town and citizen. <<Nowadays**T1**Spelling**None**7**Nowaday>>, the big number of young people <<become**T2**Tense_choice**None**11**is becoming>> <<criminals**T3**lex_item_choice**None**6**crimes>>. I think that we must understand reasons of this problem and <<try to find**T4**Verb_Inf**None**8**try find>> solvings of it.
Firstly, there is a necessity <<to understand**T18**Infinitive_constr**None**16**in understanding>> causes of this <<change**T5**lex_item_choice**None**11**development>>. In fact, economic and financial meltdowns are serious problems for everybody. Lack of jobs, activities for <<the young**T7**Conversion**None**5**young>> is a <<consequence**T6**Spelling**None**11**concequence>> of the economic problems. If <<a person**T8**Articles**None**6**person>> hasn’t opportunities of legal working or playing, he <<starts seeking**T9**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**14**starts seeking>> alternative variants, <<for example,**T12**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> some <<criminal**T13**Suffix**None**5**crime>> structures. In this case difficult <<economic**T35**Category_confusion**None**10**economic’s>> <<conditions**T11**lex_item_choice**None**12**conditionals>> lead to increasing number of young adults <<joined in**T37**Spelling**None**10**jointed in>> <<criminal**T36**Suffix**None**5**crime>> <<structures**T38**Noun_number**None**9**structure>> and lack of special places for walking, playing leads to a big percentage of children who <<start communicating**T16**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**17**start communicate>> with <<criminals**T17**lex_item_choice**None**6**crimes>>.
For solving this problem <<government**T43**Articles**None**12**a government>>, parents and teachers must act. The goverment <<, firstly,**T41**Punctuation**None**7**firstly>> should stabilize <<the economy**T34**Articles**None**7**economy>> because only in <<a stable economy**T19**Articles**None**14**stable economy>> people can <<look for**T44**Prepositional_verb**None**4**look>> prospects and develop. Also the government must improve <<the conditions**T45**Articles**None**10**conditions>> of infrastructure for <<adolescents**T40**Inappropriate_register**None**10**young guys>> and children because only when they have places for playing can they play <<enough**T39**Spelling**None**5**enoth>> and forget about crimes. Parents also need to act. Generally parents are the main models of behaviour for children and sources of <<knowledge**T21**Countable_uncountable**None**10**knowledges>>, <<experience**T20**Spelling**None**9**experiens>>. Parents can <<tell about**T46**lex_item_choice**None**7**explain>> <<the bad sides**T47**Articles**None**9**bad sides>> of crime and also can participate in <<children's**T42**Possessive**None**8**children>> actions, which is good for their development. Teachers also must create lessons, conversations with young persons.
So, <<the rising percentage**T22**Articles**None**17**rising percentage>> of young people <<involved in crime**T23**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**in crime>> is <<a dangerous trend**T24**Articles**None**15**dangerous trend>>. <<It is bad**T15**Tense_form**None**7**It bad,>> because it will lead to <<a significant increase**T27**Articles**None**20**significant increase>> <<in**T28**Prepositions**None**2**of>> <<the number**T29**Articles**None**6**number>> of crimes. I believe that the government has the biggest chances to change <<the situation**T30**Articles**None**9**situation>>: <<it**T31**Redundant_comp**None**14**the government>> can create good conditions for development, stabilize <<the economy**T32**Articles**None**7**economy>>. But parents and teachers also have influence <<on**T48**Prepositions**None**3**for>> <<the young**T33**Adj_as_collective**None**5**young>>. Participation in games, conversations <<is**T14**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> good.
