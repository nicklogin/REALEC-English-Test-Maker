Nowadays the problem of <<the high crime rate**T1**Articles**None**17**a high crime rate>> among young people has become a significant problem for society as it affects our <<security.**T2**Punctuation**None**8**security>> In this paper I would like to <<outline**T3**lex_item_choice**None**7**suggest>> the causes of this phenomena and make advise how to tackle #DELETE#4#with the given problem.
In my opinion, the most prominent reasons for <<the high crime rate**T5**Articles**None**17**a high crime rate>> among young people is <<lack**T6**Articles**None**6**a lack>> of sufficient education in school and <<the high inequality**T12**Articles**None**15**high inequality>> between social classes. Nowadays school provide not enough educational materials and lectures related to the topic of crime. Students do not acknowledge how dangerous their inappropriate actions might be for society and for themselves. As an example, we can observe increased cases of shooting at schools and colleges. Another significant cause of crimes committed by young people is <<the increasing inequality**T13**Articles**None**21**increasing inequality>> in society. Young people from the lower classes of society are not satisfied with this state of affairs, which drags them to committing more robberies and thefts. Take a student who lacks money for his education and living. The only way for him to get money is to violate the law <<, because**T7**Punctuation**None**7**because>> he cannot find an appropriate job.
Considering the causes of <<the high crime rate**T8**Articles**None**15**high crime rate>> among young people, schools and parents should provide more education to <<them**T9**Redundant_comp**Dependent_change**12**young people>>. Teacher and parents should speak more about the danger of becoming a criminal and suggest that young people can achieve success without being perpetrators.
Taking into account all above-mentioned factors, it is obvious that <<the high amount**T11**Articles**None**11**high amount>> of young criminals constitutes a serious problem with deep causes. It is to be hoped that educational methods would help in combating this social illness.
