The charts illustrate the number of transported goods in <<the European**T21**Articles**None**8**European>> countries during 2008. There are two charts that <<give**T2**Tense_form**None**5**gives>> us information about <<the transportation**T3**Articles**None**14**transportation>> by rail and by road.

As can be seen from the graph, the biggest amount of goods transported by rail is metals, which is different in products transported by road. This number reveals that the metals delivered by auto transport is<<was**T7**Tense_choice**None**2**is>>nly 11 pe<<percent**T4**Spelling**None**8**per cent>>while railway transport is almost three times mo<<bigger**T5**lex_item_choice**None**4**more>>han this amount. The food products transported by road is<<are**T6**Tense_form**None**2**is>>pproximately one third of all goods, whereas the percentage of th<<these**T8**lex_item_choice**None**4**this>>oods in railway de<<delivery**T25**Spelling**None**9**deliverly>>s only 11 pe<<percent**T9**Spelling**None**8**per cent>><<.
