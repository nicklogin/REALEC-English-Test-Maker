The graph below shows information about <<the trades**T16**Noun_number**None**5**trade>> among countries of Eastern Europe. <<The first chart**T3**Articles**None**11**First chart>> shows shares of goods transported by rail, while <<the second graph**T4**Articles**None**12**second graph>> <<gives**T5**Agreement_errors**None**4**give>> <<the information**T6**Articles**None**11**information>> about road transportation. 

Firstly, it can be seen<< that**T7**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> manufactured goods have similar shares in rail and road <<transportations**T8**Noun_number**None**14**transportation>>. Additionally, chemicals have approximately <<the same shares**T9**Articles**None**11**same shares>> with 11% in <<the railway transportation**T13**Articles**None**22**railway transportation>> and 16% in the <<road one**T16**Spelling**None**4**toad>>. The difference that strikes #DELETE#2#in my eyes is that the biggest share in goods transported by rail is taken by metals with 35%. On the other hand, it is only 11% in the road transportation. The delivery of food products takes 30% share, when it is significantly less in <<the train transportation**T15**Articles**None**20**train transportation>> with just 11%. 

In conclusion, the general trend is that heavy goods<< like machinery and metals**T16**Punctuation**None**28**, like machinery and metals,>> are transported by rail, while food is mainly delivered by road.
