In the modern world there are many ideas about the using of modern <<technologies**T241**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> in the medicine. Let us <<start with**T225**Verb_pattern**None**10**start from>> <<considering**T224**lex_item_choice**None**12**рассмотрения>> these technologies <<in detail**T226**Redundant**None**14**in the details>>.
Firstly, I would like to say that <<there are**T227**Abs_comp_clause**None**5**there>> many health problems which we can <<cure**T228**lex_item_choice**None**8**вылечить>> <<using**T229**Participial_constr**None**10**with using>> modern technology. For example, a broken hand, foot or sheaf       also you can use of modern technology for the лечения зубов. It is important that some new <<technologies**T235**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> we can see only in the best hospitals, <<pharmacies**T230**lex_item_choice**None**7**аптеках>> but in some <<villages**T231**Spelling**None**8**villiges>> there are <<no such institutions**T232**Absence_explanation**None**8**not them>>. People from small towns or <<villages**T233**Spelling**None**8**villiges>> get to the centre, in their city with their problems. They get to the good     with <<serious**T237**lex_item_choice**None**10**серьезными>> health problems only. For example, when a person has <<an ill**T238**Articles**None**3**ill>> heart, or some <<diseases**T239**lex_item_choice**None**7**болезни>> which <<are incompatible**T240**lex_item_choice**None**12**несовместимы>> with life.
Secondly, I believe that <<-**T242**Articles**None**3**the>> modern <<technologies**T243**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> can give <<-**T244**Redundant_comp**None**2**to>> people a second <<chance**T245**lex_item_choice**None**4**шанс>> to live a whole life, for instance, a person without a foot or hand <<can have a new**T246**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**can     new>> <<limb**T247**lex_item_choice**None**10**конечность>> which will be <<done**T248**Voice**None**2**do>> from some new <<materials**T249**Spelling**None**9**matirials>>. Some hospitals use laser...



In conclusion, <<-**T250**Articles**None**3**the>> modern world <<made**T251**lex_item_choice**None**6**do get>> a new step in <<-**T252**Articles**None**3**the>> treatment. Today many people have opportunities to <<improve**T253**lex_item_choice**None**9**do better>> their health with some new technologies.
