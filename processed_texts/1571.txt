The pie charts show the <<percentage**T1**Noun_number**None**11**percentages>> of <<different goods**T2**Absence_explanation**None**5**goods>> transported by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. It <<can**T13**Tense_choice**None**5**could>> be seen that machinery and metals <<were**T15**Tense_choice**None**3**are>> mainly transported by trains rather than by road.
First of all, food products account for 30% of goods transported by road, whilst by rail the <<figure**T14**Noun_number**Dependent_change**7**figures>> <<was**T28**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> about <<a third of that**T12**Numerical**None**14**3 time smaller>>. Manufactured goods <<made**T18**Tense_choice**None**4**make>> up one fourth of <<the total amount**T19**Articles**None**12**total amount>> in both <<transportation modes**T17**lex_item_choice**None**5**cases>>. <<It is worth**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**It worth>> noting that#DELETE#1#, machinery goods <<represented**T20**Tense_choice**None**9**represent>> 2% of total transportation by road, whereas by rail machinery goods <<accounted**T21**Tense_choice**None**7**account>> for 12%. The amount of chemicals transported by road <<made**T22**Tense_choice**None**5**makes>> up 16%, <<which**T23**Coordinate**None**4**that>> is <<by 5%**T25**Numerical**None**2**5%>> <<bigger than**T7**Comparative_constr**None**12**bigger, than>> in #DELETE#7#case of rail transportation. The segment of non-<<metallic**T26**Spelling**None**9**metalllic>> minerals transportation in the overall structure of road transportation <<was**T27**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> <<approximately**T4**Spelling**None**12**aproximmatly>> twice as big as in <<the railway transportation structure**T8**Articles**None**32**railway transportation structure>>.
Taking everything into consideration, it could be concluded that#DELETE#1#, machinery and metals goods are predominant in rail transportation. <<In contrast,**T9**Punctuation**None**11**In contrast>> food products, chemicals and non-metallic minerals <<made**T10**Tense_choice**None**4**make>> up the <<major part**T28**lex_item_choice**None**8**majority>> of road transportation.
