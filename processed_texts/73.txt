<<Famous**T1**lex_item_choice**None**5**Large>> musical labels and cinema companies <<suffer**T2**Agreement_errors**None**7**suffers>> from the pirates activity losing enormous sums of money, so <<there**T3**lex_item_choice**None**4**that>> is nothing to <<ask**T4**lex_item_choice**None**12**wonder about>>, when they do call for punishment of <<those who share their production illegally**T5**Defining**None**43**those, who share their production illegally>> and <<those who download such files for free**T6**Defining**None**39**those, who download such files for free>>. But I definitely disagree with such position and I’ll explain why.
Firstly, free information sharing is a very important factor in <<cultural development**T7**Articles**None**22**a cultural development>> <<not only**T8**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**2**as>> for every particular person, <<but also**T9**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**2**as>> for society as an infity. By watching <<or**T10**Spelling**None**3**for>> listening to products discussed we obtain <<a huge material**T11**Articles**None**13**huge material>> for analyzing and reflecting. We may become emotionally <<fulfilled**T12**Category_confusion**None**7**fulfill>> and we may get a very profound knowledge of <<who we are**T13**Standard**None**10**who are we>> and <<where we are going**T14**Standard**None**18**where are we going>>. Can it be possible to imagine our world without Beatles? Weren’t they some kind of a voice of <<a generation**T15**Articles**None**10**generation>> common symbol? Yes, they were. And #DELETE#3#was imagine what would happen, if access to their art <<was**T17**Agreement_errors**None**4**were>> <<severely**T18**lex_item_choice**None**6**hardly>> <<limited**T19**lex_item_choice**None**10**restricted>>, if so-called pirates were punished for such dynamic “illegal” sharing? Would you support such restrictions?
Secondly, as <<far**T20**Spelling**None**3**for>> as I’m concerned, every artist wants his work to be seen and valued. It is not about money, but about self-expression, self-manifestation #DELETE#25#if you want to call it 10. And <<the Internet**T22**Articles**None**8**Internet>>, free <<share**T23**Category_confusion**None**7**sharing>>, pirates – all mentioned <<allows creators to communicate directly**T24**Verb_Inf**None**36**allows creators communicate directly>> with their potential (and non-potential) <<audience**T26**lex_item_choice**None**9**authority>>, with those who <<would**T27**Modals**None**5**could>> understand them. Capitalist #DELETE#8#login of investments and incomes do not work in such case << - music labels**T37**Punctuation**None**12**music labels>>#DELETE#16#, midue-concernt do act <<as**T41**lex_item_choice**None**12**in a role of>> giant <<parasites**T42**Noun_number**None**8**parazyte>>.
To conclude<<,**T28**Punctuation**None**1**;>> I’ll say that free share is a mechanism <<that**T29**Often_confused**None**5**which>> helps not only public, but #DELETE#2#to an author as well. <<It perfectly fulfills their needs and ambitions**T33**Standard**None**48**It fulfills their needs and ambitions, perfectly>> and encourages <<dynamic development**T34**Standard**None**19**development dynamic>> of both of them. So if we must choose between general good and pragmatic material interests of firms and companies, I will <<undoubtedly**T35**Spelling**None**9**undoubtly>> choose the first option.
