In our days there appears a growing problem of antisocial and dangerous behaviour among young people. To my mind, this issue needs a thorough look and a serious tackle. In this essay, I will outline several reasons for this behaviour and suggest some possible solutions which can be taken.
To begin with, the problem is related to the lack of p<<parental control over children**T289**Redundant_comp**Dependent_change**36**parents' control over their children>> because t<<their parents**T290**Ref_device**Dependent_change**4**they>>are often very busy with their work and cannot look after t<<them**T291**Ref_device**Dependent_change**14**their children>> What is more, during the development of the Internet, b<<a bigger amount**T292**Articles**None**13**bigger amount>>of dangerous and violent information spreads by it. More young people nowadays have access to the global net so they see this cruelty and it influences their minds.
As for the solutions, teachers, for example, can organize additional lessons for those ki<<kids whose**T293**Defining**None**11**kids, whose>>arents are busy at work. They can also organize excursions, trips to the cinemas and theatres and other interesting activities. Parents, in their turn, should spend enough time to look after their children and be more attentive to their thoughts, mood and behaviour. Of course, it is their responsibility to give their children love and bring them up properly. Also they should put special fi<<filters**T294**Spelling**None**7**filtres>>n home computers which avoid dangerous ci<<sites**T295**Spelling**None**5**cites>>ith an<<inappropriate content**T296**Articles**None**24**an inappropriate content>>In conclusion, I can say that if the<<the solutions mentioned above**T297**Standard**None**29**the above mentioned solutions>>e implemented, the number of crimes committed by young people will decrease. It is ver<<a very urgent issue**T299**Articles**None**17**very urgent issue>>d it is our responsibility to tackle it for the sake of our children and security of our society.
