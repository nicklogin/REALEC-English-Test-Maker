There is much debate about the influence of <<technology**T1**Spelling**None**10**technolody>> on health. Some people hold firmly to the belief that health problems can be caused by the use of modern techology. The essay will discuss, firtsly, some problems of health, and, secondly, solutions for resolving <<them**T2**Ref_device**None**4**ones>>, followed by a reasoned conlusion
There is some <<evidence**T3**Spelling**None**8**evidance>> to suggest that many health problems are the result of using <<technology**T4**Spelling**None**10**technolody>>. According to scientists, invention of computers and <<younger generation's addiction**T15**Possessive**None**26**addiction young generation>> to them destroy <<yongsters**T16**Ref_device**None**5**their>> health. An example to support the thesis is <<the increasing number**T6**Articles**None**20**an increasing number>> of teenagers with problems of the sight. Moreover, the environment has <<a tendency**T18**Articles**None**8**tendency>> to deteriorate <<, which**T19**Coordinate**None**4**that>> will lead to <<diseases**T17**Redundant_comp**None**18**diseases of people>>. <<It's a matter of fact that**T20**lex_part_choice**None**22**As the matter of fact,>> the use of cars causes the pollution and shortage of fresh air.
The problems are <<enormously widespread**T21**Category_confusion**None**22**an enormous widespread>> and they should be solved. There are several ways to resolve the acute problems. One of them is the intervention of the government that can impose taxes or implement draconian measures. For example, through taxes number of cars would be decreased and <<the issue of pollution**T22**Articles**None**18**issue of pollution>> <<would**T23**Lack_par_constr**None**4**will>> be resolved <<to some extent**T7**lex_part_choice**None**14**in some extent>>. Furthermore, people should <<control**T8**Voice**None**10**controlled>> the behaviour of their children. It will be a good idea to decrease the time of <<them using**T24**Absence_explanation**None**3**use>> phones and computers. Walking with children, playing active games outside, going to countries can be <<significant measures**T9**Articles**None**22**a significant measures>> to minimize <<the harmful influences**T10**Articles**None**20**a harmful influences>> of modern technology.
In <<conclusion**T25**Spelling**None**9**conlusion>>, it should be <<emphasized**T11**Spelling**None**11**empohasised>> that there is negative effect of <<technology**T12**Spelling**None**10**technolody>>. Nevertheless, <<people**T13**Spelling**None**5**peole>> and government are <<capable of reducing**T14**lex_item_choice**None**19**available to reduce>> it.
