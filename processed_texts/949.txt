The statement that <<nowadays young people commit more crimes than ever before**T3**Absence_explanation**None**47**more crimes are being committed by young people>> is not <<absolute truth**T2**Absence_explanation**None**8**absolute>>. While it may be true that the number of crimes increases, <<but it could also be true that**T5**Absence_explanation**None**3**but>> <<their**T4**Possessive**None**3**the>> significance decreases.
Nevertheless, it still remains a problem for society if <<young people**T25**Inappropriate_register**None**10**youngsters>> tend not to follow #DELETE#3#the the rules. In my opinion, <<insufficient**T9**Spelling**None**12**unsufficient>> attention is the cause of it. First of all, parents should spend more time with <<their children**T10**Absence_explanation**None**8**children>> even if they are usually busy at work. A child <<needs**T11**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> someone who he or she will perceive as an example of good behavior. It is great if he or she has one and it means a child will copy good behavior and get knowledge about ethics.
But there is a significant drawback in this point of view. What if parents work all week and simply do not have a lot of spare time for children? Because of that teachers in schools should also take responsibility for children in their classes. But it also require teachers to have high moral <<standards**T13**Spelling**None**9**standarts>>.
Both parents and teachers should teach children #DELETE#3#how to be responsible. It means that they should understand that every action has consequences. It means <<parents**T15**Noun_number**None**6**parent>> and teachers should pay attention to <<a child's**T19**Absence_explanation**Dependent_change**3**the>> <<successes,**T18**Punctuation**None**9**successes>> but at the same time they <<should**T16**Spelling**None**7**shoulde>> <<be strict**T17**Category_confusion**None**6**strick>> if <<the child**T20**Articles**Dependent_change**1**a>> child did something bad. In this situation they would motivate children to be better and prevent them from bad <<behavior**T21**Suffix**None**9**behaviour>>.
I believe that <<behavior**T22**Suffix**None**9**behaviour>> of young people depends on how they grew up. And that is the <<reason why**T23**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**reason>> I think that parents and teachers are able to influence <<adolescents**T24**Inappropriate_register**None**5**teens>> and it is the most sufficient way to struggle with <<the increasing**T25**Articles**None**17**increasing number>> of crimes committed by young people.
