Some part of humanity thinks that countries should import to other countries a minimum part of food which <<is produced**T1**Voice**None**8**produces>> in this country, <<and**T2**Capitalisation**None**3**And>> the food should be <<of the same value**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**14**the same value>> with food which population needs. I <<disagree**T4**Category_confusion**None**11**am disagree>> with this statement and I will try to explain why. 

First of all, there are some countries in the world which can not produce as much food as <<its**T5**Spelling**None**5**it is>> population needs. <<So**T8**Capitalisation**None**2**SO>> other countries can help such countries and <<their**T22**Pronouns**None**3**its>> people to survive by import some food to them. Also some countries have not got a special <<equipment**T9**Spelling**None**9**aquipment>> for producing any type of <<food**T10**Spelling**None**4**doof>> or in this region some species of plants cannot grow or kind of anymals cannot live. But this <<countries**T11**Spelling**None**9**countryes>> can produce other <<types**T12**Noun_number**None**4**type>> of resources. So countries can <<exchange**T13**Spelling**None**8**excnenge>> <<their**T14**Spelling**None**4**thir>> goods, or sell some products, with they have to earn money and buy food or something else from another country.  Secondly, if <<a country**T15**Articles**None**7**country>> can produce more food than <<its**T16**Spelling**None**4**it’s>> population can eat, <<such a country**T18**Articles**None**12**such country>> will be able to sell a part of food which they don’t need to earn some money and improve the <<life**T19**Spelling**None**4**live>> of <<the population**T20**Articles**None**10**population>> of this country or it can solve some problems which this county has (<<for example,**T21**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> problems with bad roads). 

In conclusion, I can say that it is really necessary for all of us and for all countries to help each other with food. That is why <<countries which can produce more food than they need**T22**Defining**None**54**countries, which can produce more food than they need,>> should do that and give or sell this food to other countries.
