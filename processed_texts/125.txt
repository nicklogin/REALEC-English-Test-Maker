There is a popular opinion that today young people tend to commit more crimes than before. Media provides us news about murders, beatings and shopliftings committed by young people more and more frequently. This essay analyzes causes of this phenomenon, and what can be done by parents and teachers to solve it.
I personally think that there are two reasons of this development. The first one is that today more and more young parents prefer their career growth rather than care for their family. So, when a child is born, she receives much less attention from her parents. Later, she finds new friends, who probably grew up in the same conditions, and they do not have a set of moral values that should have been taken from their parents. As a result, they do not know what is good, and what is bad, and this group of children may become a small gang when they realize that there is easier to receive money by robbing than by legal ways. There is the additional factor which I consider as the second reason: accessibility of information that may be inappropriate for a child. The lack of parents' attention can be replaced by Internet and videogames, and the child learns new knowledge about violence, drugs or something like that very quickly but without right explanation And it can also create the wrong set of values and lead him to become a criminal.
In my opinion, what parents should do is to give enough care and attention to their children. They should control what their child watches, reads or plays, and who are her companions. However, not only parents but school teachers can make their influence on this issue: for instance, they can teach children not only math and language, but also about how to socialize and become a righteous citizen.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the problem of crimes committed by youth is very important; however, it can be reduced or eliminated by parents and teachers in primary schools.
