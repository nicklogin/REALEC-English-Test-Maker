Nowadays everyone can choose what to watch from the great variety of films all over the world. <<However,**T3**suggestion**None**7**However>> there is no secret that films produced in Great Britan and <<the USA**T2**suggestion**None**3**USA>> are more popular than <<the local ones**T5**suggestion**None**10**local ones>>. Of course in some cases it depends on the <<personal**T6**suggestion**None**7**persons>> taste, but there are many people who do not want to watch films made in their own <<countries**T7**Spelling**None**8**contries>> or cities.
O<<On the one hand,**T9**suggestion**None**15**On the one hand>>it seems to be quite bad and even unfair that local films are not s<<so popular as**T4**suggestion**None**15**so popular than>>British and American ones. M<<Maybe**T11**suggestion**None**6**May be>>there is a problem in advertising, m<<maybe**T12**suggestion**None**6**may be>>we should start watching local films j#DELETE#4#ust f<<, and they will improve**T10**suggestion**None**19**for their improving>> But o<<, on the other hand,**T13**suggestion**None**17**on the other hand>>everything has its reasons. If people prefer British and American films, they must be better than the ones produced in the local industries. G<<Governments**T21**suggestion**None**10**Goverments>>of our cities do not spent so much money on producing films. A<<As a result,**T14**suggestion**None**11**As a result>>there are l<<fewer**T22**suggestion**None**4**less>>special effects, l<<fewer**T24**suggestion**None**4**less>>d<<sets**T23**suggestion**None**11**decorations>>and other t<<things**T15**Noun_number**None**5**thing>>than in American and British films. But the most important thing is people who make these films, who write and think about s<<the story line**T25**suggestion**None**10**story line>> who p<<produce**T16**Spelling**None**7**produse>>all the a<<actions**T26**suggestion**None**6**action>>and who act. If local goverments want to make film i<<industry**T17**Noun_number**None**10**industries>>better and more popular, they should pay attention to people,<< who**T28**Punctuation**None**5**, who>>work there, to their education and, of coure, o<<to**T29**suggestion**None**2**on>>their salaries. What about other ways to help local industries, we must not forget about advertising, which is important for popularity of films, but it c<<cannot**T18**suggestion**None**7**can not>>help if films and the process of their producing n<<need**T30**Agreement_errors**None**5**needs>>i<<improving**T31**Verb_Gerund**None**11**improvement>>
All in all, the main re<<reason for**T32**suggestion**None**9**reason of>>o<<the popularity of British and American films**T33**suggestion**None**41**the popularity British and American films>>s their high quality. Local governments should support film in<<industry**T20**Noun_number**None**10**industries>>n a way to make their films better and as a result more popular.
