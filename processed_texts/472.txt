Humans have been trying to learn more about <<space**T8**Articles**None**9**the space>> for many years and by this moment a huge amount of work has been done. Besides, there are things that <<should**T1**Spelling**None**5**sould>> be solved <<as fast as possible**T2**Redundant**None**22**as fast as it possible>>, but there is a question: what is more important to invest in?
From my point of view, space exploration is one of the most significant parts of the country's position in the world. The more you are doing for this field, the more p<<privileges**T3**Spelling**None**11**priviledges>>on the international scene you have. First of all, people t<<tend**T4**Spelling**None**4**tent>>to look in the future and they try to find a better place to live and raise children. For example, t<<the number one issue in the space science is the following**T9**Absence_comp_colloc**None**41**the number one issue in the space science>> can we find a planet that has all the conditions human beings need? And scientists have been working on it for many years. What's more, today it i<<seems**T10**Tense_form**None**8**is seems>>that the q<<amount**T11**lex_item_choice**None**8**quantity>>of s<<effort**T12**lex_item_choice**None**8**strenght>>and money a country spends on t<<space exploration**T13**Absence_comp_colloc**None**9**the space>>shows the real potential of this country.
On the other hand, many people think that th<<social problems**T14**Articles**None**19**the social problems>>uch as poverty or gr<<the greenhouse effect**T5**Articles**None**17**greenhouse effect>>for instance, are much more important for the society. Firstly, th<<space exploration**T15**Articles**None**21**the space exploration>>equires enormous amount of money which can be spent on lots of pr<<other problems**T16**Absence_comp_colloc**None**8**problems>>Moreover, problems of space do not ha<<draw**T18**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>>v<<common**T17**lex_item_choice**None**7**average>>eople's attention. They have other problems to deal with and do not see the advantages of being citizens of the great space country.
However, I think that there are a p<<plenty**T19**Articles**None**8**a plenty>> ways to cope with this issue. If the government inv<<invests**T20**Agreement_errors**None**6**invest>>t so gre<<much**T21**lex_item_choice**None**13**great sums of>>ney in space, it will have more to give people to solve their problems.
To sum up, I would like to emphasize that there is no righ<<single right answer**T22**Absence_comp_colloc**None**12**right answer>>this question: wh#DELETE#1#er<<what we should spend money on**T24**lex_part_choice**None**27**where we should spend money>>eryone has to desi<<decide**T25**Spelling**None**6**deside>> himself or herself. There are many anva<<advantages**T6**Spelling**None**10**anvantages>> disadvantages from<<for**T26**Prepositions**None**4**from>> <<either point**T27**lex_part_choice**None**15**the both points>>view.
