In my essay, i will express my express my own view on that.

Today, when TV is so available, people are trying to be aware of almost every sport event, because it allows them to be on the top of things without any charges. Personally, i admit watching sport event on TV, Moreover i do not agree with people who claimed that watching sports on TV or at live is a waste of time.

In my point of view, for me a big sport fan, who is really rooting for tennis who love sport more than anyone in this words, watching sport events bring me a great pleasure. It helps me set my mind and it really makes me a calm person.
When people visit some sport event and watch the scene in live it is unforgettable Moreover, It helps you to spend your time on something important, when you see all that people who are going wild and this argues between referee and players.
In contrasts, i want to add that some sportsmen inspire men on aspiring their goals
In conclusion, i want to say that people are willing to address their own point of view watching sport, and these theme will be always extremely topical, for someone it is just a waste of time, for another it is excitement, but for me it is a style of my life, and i am not going to deny it.
