Illegal pirate copies is <<the biggest problem**T1**Articles**None**15**biggest problem>> for musicians and film products nowadays. And <<some of them think that**T2**Punctuation**None**24**some of them think, that>> people, <<who are copying, sharing or downloading films or music from internet,**T4**Defining**None**69**who are copying, sharing or downloading films or music from internet,>> should be punished. I would argue that there is two sides of this problem. 

On the one hand, the pirate copies <<do not**T5**Agreement_errors**None**7**doesn’t>> let musicians and <<producers**T6**Spelling**None**9**produsers>> <<earn**T7**Tense_choice**None**7**earning>> more money, they could lose <<millions**T8**Noun_number**None**7**million>> of dollars because of pirate copies. Also, because of this <<reason**T9**Spelling**None**7**reasone>> they could lose motivation to create anything else. Do you remember what Beoynce said once? ‘If you #DELETE#3#are adore what I do, if you respect me as a person, if you are my truly fan, you will buy only official products by me’.

On the other hand, let’s look on people who, <<for example,**T12**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> <<cannot**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> <<afford**T14**Spelling**None**6**efford>> a ticket to the cinema? Or they just <<cannot**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> buy an official Beoynce album <<on Itunes**T16**Prepositions**None**9**in Itunes>>. So what do they have to do? <<Is**T17**Agreement_errors**None**3**Are>> anyone able to make them <<stop**T18**Prepositions**None**7**to stop>> loving Martin Scorsese movies or Beoynce songs? No. These poor people go to the <<pirate**T19**Spelling**None**7**pirates>> sites because of love to their <<favorite**T20**Spelling**None**9**favorites>> actors/singers. Not because of bad minds or something like that. 

<<In conclusion,**T21**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> <<I want to say that**T22**Punctuation**None**19**I want to say, that>> downloading <<pirate copies**T23**Articles**None**15**a pirate copies>> from <<the Internet**T27**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> <<is not**T26**Inappropriate_register**None**5**isn’t>> a crime, it makes singers/actors more famous anyway. And maybe, if the pirate copies problem will be solved one day, all <<these**T27**Ref_device**None**4**this>> famous people could lose a lot of their truly fans.
