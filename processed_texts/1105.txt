The growing rates of crimes <<committed**T1**Spelling**None**8**commited>> by young people have been a topic for heated debates for the last <<two**T2**Absence_comp_sent**None**6**couple>> decades. Nowadays the problem is even more relevant than ever before, because governments are failing to tackle the problem via strong punishments and extra restrictions. That’s why the society should develop new approaches to the problem solution, based on positive influence of parents and teachers.
Let’s try to list the main reasons for crimes <<committed**T5**Spelling**None**8**commited>> by children and <<adolescents**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**9**teenagers>> and think how those crimes should be prevented. Some children might be engaged in stealing or robbery <<, because**T6**Punctuation**None**7**because>> they don’t have enough money to fulfill their needs and desires. Parents should <<definitely**T3**Spelling**None**10**definetely>> try to give their children an opportunity to earn their pocket money. Doing household chores or walking with a dog will not only bring a child <<several**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**8**a couple>> dollars <<, but**T8**Punctuation**None**3**but>> also teach him or her that money should be earned by labor.
Others might feel lack of understanding and love from their parents or classmates. Parents and teachers should talk to children, help them to build communication with other people. A person who is able to make true friends and who knows that he or she is surrounded by love and care is less likely to commit a crime.
The last reason which we will mention is <<the permanent stress**T12**Articles**None**16**permanent stress>> children and <<adolescents**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**5**teens>> face in their everyday lives. Fear of flunking an exam, quarelling with parents might cause negative psychological effects and aggression finding its way out through violence and even crimes. Teachers should be very attentive to such students and provide them with a help of <<a professional psychologist**T10**Articles**None**25**professional psychologist>>, if necessary. In other words, the best solution to <<the problem**T11**Articles**None**7**problem>> doesn’t lie in the field of tough punishments and the strictest laws. We should try to smooth the process of socialization and growing instead. Being able to earn some money, make friends and having support in tough times will significantly decrease <<the number of incentives**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**14**the incentives>> to break the law.
