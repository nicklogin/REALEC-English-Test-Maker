In our days there is a problem of illegal using of some types of content, like music and films. There is an opinion, that people, who “steal” content should be punished, and I am agree with it.

First of all, I am a musician, I compose music. I have 1000$ microphone, 50$ keyboard and other very expensive music staff. I also give a lot of money for recording songs (100$ per song). So, when people buy my music I get some money to continue my work. The “pirates” in the Internet, who download content illegally ruins this system. Engeneers got salary per month, but I am not because of these people, who don’t want to pay 15$ per song. It is less than the coffee cup!

The film producers also lose the huge amount of money because of the pirates. Shooting a film cost millions. All this money is a salary for actors, designers, scenery-writers, operators etc. Producing film is a difficult work, and the advertishment also costs a lot. After shootings the film is showed in a cinema, but there are the people, who must bought tickets? They already watched this film in the Internet, because someone posted it on illegal websites. The industry suffers from the people like these.

In conclusion I must say, that “pirates” should be punished stricktly, because they kill any intentions to create something. I made good music, but but if I want to record some new songs - I need money. There is a lot of directors of the films, who wanted to make a new one (mabe a piece of art?) but he is not able to do that. So, we can say, that illegal downloading of the content stops the progress, and it is quite serious reason to punish these people.
