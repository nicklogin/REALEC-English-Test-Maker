The graph represents information about minimum and maximum temperature <<levels**T1**Noun_number**None**5**level>> during the year in two different <<cities**T2**Spelling**None**5**citys>>: Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro. 

The most striking feature is that <<the average temperature**T3**Articles**None**19**average temperature>> in Yakutsk has <<a sharp maximum**T4**Articles**None**13**sharp maximum>> while <<the temperature level**T5**lex_item_choice**None**3**one>> in Rio de Janeiro remains approximately <<the same**T6**lex_item_choice**None**20**between close values>> during the period. During the first six months both maximum and minimum average <<temperature levels**T7**Absence_explanation**None**11**temperature>> in Yakutsk <<increased**T8**lex_item_choice**None**5**roket>> from -35*C and -41*C to about 26*C and 13*C at the beginning of July, <<reaching**T9**Spelling**None**7**riching>> their maximum. By contrast,  in the Brazil city those temperatures decrease over this period, <<however not so significantly,**T10**Punctuation**None**28**however not so significantly>> from 30*C and 27*C to 25*C and 17*C respectively for maximum and minimum <<patterns**T11**lex_item_choice**None**8**opposite>>. Yakutsk’s temperatures fall again to their beginning values, <<while**T12**Spelling**None**6**whilst>> Rio de Janeiro’s one increase and also recover their values. 

It is clear that <<the temperature fluctuation**T13**Articles**None**23**temperature fluctuation>> during the year in Yakutsk is bigger and has <<a sharper form**T14**Articles**None**12**sharper form>> in comparison with Rio de Janeiro’s values.
