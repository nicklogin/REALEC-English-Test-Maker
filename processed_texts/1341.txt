In modern world some people believe that <<the use**T1**Articles**None**3**use>> of technology <<leads**T2**Agreement_errors**None**4**lead>> to serious health problems. Is it true or not?

There is no doubt that in some cases the widespread use of modern technology may cause health problems. The most obvious situation that can prove this thesis is eye <<diseases**T3**Spelling**None**8**deseases>>. Nowadays the majority of people has some problems with their eyes because of the use of gadgets. They cannot live without their mobile phones and laptops and never leave these gadgets <<at home**T4**lex_item_choice**None**5**alone>>. For the same reason people may have headaches. What is more, people  <<now**T5**Spelling**None**3**nov>> have a tendency to spend their free time <<at home**T6**Prepositions**None**7**on home>> <<lying**T7**Spelling**None**6**laying>> on the sofa and watching <<tv**T8**Articles**None**4**a TV>> or playing computer games. Thus, they <<do not**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> go for a walk and <<do not**T10**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> do any sport activity, they only become fat.

Moreover, technology has <<good aspects**T12**Articles**None**14**a good aspects>> too<< if**T13**Punctuation**None**4**, if>> people <<use**T14**Conditionals**None**9**would use>> <<them**T15**Ref_device**None**2**it>> correctly. <<Moreover,**T16**Punctuation**None**8**Moreover>> these problems will be reduced. For instance, people should prefer long walks to using their <<gadgets**T17**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>>. They should be active #DELETE#14#in their lives. In addition, they must understand the importance of time <<limits**T19**Noun_number**None**5**limit>> of using their <<gadgets**T20**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>>. <<What is more,**T21**Punctuation**None**12**What is more>> parents should teach their children to spend their spare time with friends or relatives. Going to picnics or going to a little trip can <<prevent**T22**lex_item_choice**None**4**save>> all <<these**T23**Ref_device**Dependent_change**4**this>> negative <<situations**T24**Noun_number**Dependent_change**9**situation>>.

Tu sum up, using of technology <<may**T25**Spelling**None**3**nay>> cause <<negative effects**T26**Articles**None**18**a negative effects>>, but people can reduce <<them**T27**Ref_device**None**2**it>> and find a perfect solution for this problem.
