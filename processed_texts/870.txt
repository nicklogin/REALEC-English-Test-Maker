Financial stability <<has always been**T1**Tense_choice**None**15**had always been>> one of the most important <<human**T24**Noun_number**None**7**human’s>> preoccupations. That is why nowadays governments try to invent a beneficial system of rewarding for citizens to always have some capital in case of emergency. One of these experimental programs is “Guaranteed Basic Income”, promising a sum of money paid monthly to everyone, <<whether or not a person has work**T2**if_whether_clause**None**32**whether a person has work or not>>.
O<<Obviously,**T8**Linking_device**None**9**Obviously>>such a project has a vast number of advantages. Firstly, it guarantees life for everyone, r<<eliminating**T3**lex_item_choice**None**9**recessing>>the s<<growth**T9**lex_item_choice**None**9**spreading>>of poor and homeless population layers. Secondly, in the end the sum paid could be sent back to the government, stabilizing the taxes p#DELETE#6#aying and the financial circulation in the bank system. Moreover, it would certainly improve the quality of life and strengthen the international authority of the country.
However, there are some evident disadvantages. To begin with, the monthly paid sum of money could discourage population from wo<<working**T4**Suffix**None**4**work>>t<<altogether**T5**lex_part_choice**None**6**at all>>Let us take the example of modern France, where similar law, co<<concerning only people without any job**T15**suggestion**None**39**concerning only people without any job,>>ncourages thousands of migrants and poor people to benefit from it.

On the other hand, this kind of pro<<programme**T22**Spelling**None**7**program>>u<<would appeal**T23**Tense_form**None**13**would appeals>> lower classes, which would provoke its boost.
Finally, as long as financial problems are crucial, people will be inventing a huge range of methods to solve it equally for everyone.
