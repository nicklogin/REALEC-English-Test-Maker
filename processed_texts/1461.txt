Musicians and film producers every year produce hundreds and hundreds music and films, new albums, more and more new original content. But some people do not want to spend their own money for <<things that they can get free**T1**Defining**None**30**things, that they can get free>>. They <<take**T2**Tense_form**None**5**takes>> films from the <<Internet**T3**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>>, make copies and then give all that ‘pirate materials’ to <<other people**T4**Determiners**None**7**another>> people.

I think that we must <<buy**T5**Modals**None**6**buying>> original discs or original content in the internet. There are a lot of virtual stores like ‘Steam’, ‘Origin’, ‘Playstation Store’ that <<sell**T6**Tense_form**None**4**sold>> games, films, music to <<people who want to support companies and their producers for their good job**T7**Defining**None**76**people, who want to support companies and their producers for their good job>>.

But everybody <<knows**T8**Tense_form**None**4**know>> <<the rule that says**T10**Defining**None**19**the rule, that says>> ‘<<people who download files for free instead of buying the original discs should be punished’**T11**Redundant_comp**None**93**people who download files for free, instead of buying the original discs. Should be punished’>> – is only words on paper. Because there are a lot of people all around the world<< that**T14**Defining**None**6**, that>> <<simply**T15**Category_confusion**None**6**simple>> have no money to <<buy**T13**Infinitive_constr**None**6**buying>> expensive content like a design program ‘3dMax’. If you want to buy it you must say ‘Bye’ near 130000 rubbles. Yes, you can find the students version of this program for 3 years, but if you are not a student and you are <<a designer**T16**Articles**None**8**designer>> or you are another worker in this program – you have to choose, you must <<choose**T17**Modals**None**9**to choose>> – buy this program for a lot of money or download it from Net for free.
