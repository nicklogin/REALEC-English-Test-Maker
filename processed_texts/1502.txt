There are many conversations about sports nowadays, especially about its <<drug problems**T31**Spelling**None**13**drug-problems>>. Some tend to believe that <<the sportsmen**T32**Articles**None**9**sportsmen>> should be banned from competing professionally for some limited time period. Others want such athletes to be banned permanently. There are surely some <<serious**T33**Spelling**None**6**serous>> arguments to support each of the positions.
It's crucial to understand that some people come into sports only due to <<their**T30**Word_choice**None**3**the>> love for the competition or the athletic practice itself. Banning them for some time may <<help them realize**T29**Verb_object_bare**None**20**help them to realize>> what they can actually lose if they don't stop their illegal actions. <<Moreover,**T1**Punctuation**None**8**Moreover>> there are usually coaches responsible for giving them a medicine, so banning <<an athlete**T2**Articles**None**7**athlete>> permanently may simply ruin <<their**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> life for no reason, while the real guilty person walks free.
<<On the other hand,**T4**Punctuation**None**17**On the other hand>> it's silly to deny#DELETE#1#, that such drugs affect <<the organism**T6**Articles**None**8**organism>> in <<a permanent way**T7**Articles**None**17**the permanent way>>. Some <<effects**T9**Word_choice**None**10**affections>> may be harmful and some may give <<the drug-taking athletes**T13**Articles**None**20**drug-taking athletes>> some <<advantages**T27**Noun_number**None**9**advantage>>. So letting those people compete again may be dangerous for their lives <<, causing accidents during competitions**T14**Attr_participial**None**66**causing some accidents during the competitions or simply dishonest>>. There is also a meaning#DELETE#1#, that the main <<reason**T21**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**6**factor>> <<for**T20**Prepositions**Dependent_change**2**in>> taking drugs is actually cheating. The person<< who cheated once**T22**Defining**None**19**, who cheated once,>> is not likely to be trusted again later.
To sum up, there is no certain way of dealing with such a controversial question, as both <<sides**T23**lex_item_choice**None**9**positions>> present rather convincing arguments#DELETE#1#, which have to be studied more closely. In my opinion, the choice#DELETE#1#, whether the athlete should compete again later or not is only up to <<them**T34**Inappropriate_register**None**3**him>>. The positive <<effect**T26**Word_choice**None**9**affection>> on their body may actually be present, but <<not in the way where those sportsmen would become unbeatable**T28**Absence_comp_sent**None**52**not in a way those sportsmen would become unbeatable>>, so it isn't actually cheating. We cannot take anyone's dream away just in order to punish him for misstepping once. That's not what our society is standing for.
