In these digital century the world faced a lot problems of a property. Downloading music and film from the Internet without paying is a widespread issue these days. As far I am concerned, that is not a crucial theft, which is worth punishing by law.

In the first place, buying original products of music and cinema spheres is not a cheap pleasure for a lot of people. For instance, average person watches films for 3-4 times a week, which means he or she would spend on it amount money, equal to 2 dinners, if he/she would do it at cinema.What is more, downloading content from the World Wide Net saves not only money, but also time. It is essential that “pirates” do not need to go and look for discs, but it takes a second to press “download” on the website.

In addition to this, it must be said that pirating could only be a benefit for musicians and producers due to a significant reason. When somebody really enjoy a film or a song/composition of an exact creator, he or she would love to watch a film of this producer on a big cinema’s screen or buy a music disc as a present.

On the other hand, oppenents of this point of view argue that producers lose a lot of money. However, it is my belief that they take more amounts than lose.

Taking everything into account, there is no absolute answer to this question, but I strongly believe that it should not be punished by governments and has more benefits for the both sides of action than drawbacks.
