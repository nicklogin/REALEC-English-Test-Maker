Today professional sportsmen tend to boost their results with the help of forbidden substances. It is argued that contestants that were proven to <<to have consumed**T19**Tense_choice**None**7**consume>> illegal drugs should not ever be allowed to participate in <<competitions**T20**Noun_number**None**11**competition>> while another point of view suggests that penalty <<should not**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn't>> be so strict and should last only several years. This essay will overview both opinions and make a conclusion. Some people believe that sportsmen that were caught cheating once would continue to use steroids and other means of increasing their physical possibilities even after <<a few years**T21**Quantifiers**None**9**few years>> of disqualification. Sadly, <<sports**T3**Noun_attribute**None**5**sport>> industry <<has known**T22**Tense_form**None**8**has know>> such cases. First places <<in**T23**Prepositions**None**2**at>> professional competitions bring loads of money, and that is the reason why athlets continue to commit crimes. Banning unfair <<performance**T24**lex_item_choice**None**5**stars>> could open a way to young and ambitious people who could be more interested in honest competition. The opposite argument is that disqualification <<should not**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**9**shouldn't>> be permanent. Certainly, cheating is a serious crime but <<does it really deserve**T7**Tense_form**None**23**does it really deserves>> <<such a punishment**T8**Articles**None**15**such punishment>>? Professional <<athletes**T5**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> <<devote**T25**lex_item_choice**None**3**put>> all their lives to achieve success, and all their aspirations are connected with <<triumphs in sport**T26**Confusion_of_structures**None**14**sport triumphs>>. They often <<cannot**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can't>> do anything else except their profession, so leaving a career forever might mean <<the end**T10**Articles**None**6**an end>> <<of**T27**Prepositions**None**2**to>> all their perspectives. The other point is that <<there are many disqualifications for a certain period**T29**Absence_comp_sent**None**43**many for a certain period disqualifications>>. <<No**T35**Capitalisation**None**2**no>> matter how long they are <<they do not solve**T15**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**do not solve>> the #DELETE#5#whole problem of illegal drugs use. <<Many**T36**Quantifiers**None**4**Much>> more serious <<steps**T13**Spelling**None**5**sleps>> shoud be taken to cope with such <<issues**T14**Noun_number**None**5**issue>>, the whole system should be <<reconsidered**T37**lex_item_choice**None**10**overlooked>> and reformed. To sum up, <<use of drugs**T31**Prepositional_noun**None**9**drugs use>> in sport remains a serious problem. <<Life-long**T16**Capitalisation**None**9**life-long>> penalty has some minor benefits but it <<does not**T17**Inappropriate_register**None**7**doesn't>> change the whole situation. Neither does <<a short ban**T32**Articles**None**9**short ban>> for two years although <<a permanent ban**T33**Articles**None**13**permanent ban>> could <<prevent**T34**lex_item_choice**None**4**keep>> more competitors from unfair <<game.**T18**Punctuation**None**4**game>>
