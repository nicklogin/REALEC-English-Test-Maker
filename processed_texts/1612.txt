The products of <<technological progress**T304**lex_item_choice**None**10**innovation>> came to our lives not so far ago but we already can't imagine our lives without them even despite of some problems which these goods cause to us. It's a very important question how to deal with them because people <<are**T305**Tense_choice**None**4**will>> <<unlikely to**T306**Prepositional_adjective**None**8**unlikely>> give up the usage of gadgets.
The most <<obvious**T307**Spelling**None**7**obvrous>> problem which we gain using electronics <<is**T322**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> connected with eyes: when we sit in front of <<a screen**T321**Noun_number**None**7**screens>> for a long time we <<lose**T323**Spelling**None**5**loose>> our ability to see well. Also active <<usage**T310**Spelling**None**4**usag>> of technological goods may <<influence**T311**Verb_pattern**None**12**influence on>> brains and other crucial organs causing, <<for example,**T312**Punctuation**None**11**for example>> <<a heart attack**T313**Articles**None**12**heart attack>>. Several years ago I saw news <<about**T324**Redundant_comp**None**9**about how>> <<a teenager**T314**Articles**None**12**the teenager>> died after he had been playing computer games a couple of days without a stop. Though, it is an <<exceptional**T315**Spelling**None**10**exeptional>> case <<that**T325**Spelling**None**4**ther>> problems are connected with our possibilities. New technologies make people's <<life**T326**Spelling**None**4**live>> eager, performing their actions for themselves.
After all, the laziness <<accelerates**T327**lex_item_choice**None**7**engines>> the progress. <<Not only do we become dependent on technologies, but also**T328**Emphatic**None**45**We not only become dependent on technologies,>> we tail to perform some actions. As a physical problem it can result in people being fat. Gadgets can't be <<got**T316**Voice**None**3**get>> away from our lifestyle, people won't allow it. Of course, they play <<a significant and positive role**T317**Articles**None**29**significant and positive role>>, they just have side effects. <<Thus,**T320**Spelling**None**4**Thys>> people should be able to <<explain**T318**Spelling**None**7**explane>> the negative effects of technologies to themselves in different ways - <<governments**T319**Spelling**None**10**goverments>> should advertise health and sports, for example, opening new sports courses for people! Parents should control at least the time their children use gadgets.
To sum up, technologies are <<inevitable**T321**Prefix**None**10**unevitable>>, but they have certain side effects on us and we should be able to prevent them.
