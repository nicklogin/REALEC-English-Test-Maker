Nowadays, some people think that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionally for a limited period of time. Some others think that such athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. This essay will discuss both points of view.
On the one hand, there is no doubt that using illegal drugs to boost you physical <<abilities**T23**Spelling**None**10**abbilities>> and improve your scores <<in**T24**Prepositions**None**2**on>> competition is dishonest, unethical and <<unsportsmanlike**T25**Derivation**None**10**unsportive>>. Such athletes distort <<people's**T32**Possessive**None**6**people>> <<perception**T31**Word_choice**None**11**imagination>> about professional sport and <<, consequently,**T35**Punctuation**None**12**consequently>> decrease people interest <<in**T21**Prepositions**None**2**to>> <<it**T22**Ref_device**None**4**them>>. <<From this point of view,**T30**Punctuation**None**23**From this point of view>> I can agree with those who think that such athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. Another supportive <<argument that**T26**Punctuation**None**13**argument, for>> banning athletes for the rest of their <<lives is that we**T29**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**lives we>> can ensure that those people will stop using <<drugs**T19**Spelling**None**6**druggs>>. It will cause a decrease <<in**T34**Prepositions**None**2**of>> drug expansion between athletes, and it will <<improve**T18**Spelling**None**8**improove>> their health condition.
On the other hand, everybody makes mistakes. We can imagine that <<an athlete**T12**Articles**None**7**athlete>> in his <<search**T14**Category_confusion**None**4**seek>> <<for**T13**Prepositions**None**2**to>> achievements#DELETE#1#, <<is ready**T15**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**ready>> to try everything to increase his <<abilities**T16**Spelling**None**10**abbilities>>. In that case, using illegal drugs is the easiest way to achieve your goals. The best way to eliminate <<athletes**T33**Possessive**None**9**athlete's>> hesitations: to use drugs, or not to use, is a <<temporary**T11**Word_choice**None**12**limited time>> <<ban**T10**Spelling**None**4**bann>>. Using this solution for the problem of illegal drugs <<use**T9**Word_choice**None**5**using>>, we can ensure that after athletes return to professional competitions, he will never try to improve his skills by using drugs.
<<In conclusion,**T2**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> we can <<state that**T3**Punctuation**None**11**state, that>> illegal drugs are absolutely <<unacceptable**T4**Derivation**None**13**un acceptable>> in professional sport, and <<athletes**T5**Spelling**None**7**athlets>> caught using <<these**T6**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> drugs should be banned, but the period of their <<ban**T7**Spelling**None**4**bann>> <<should depend**T8**Modals**None**14**should depends>> on the situation.
