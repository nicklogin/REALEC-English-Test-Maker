The same situation <<is predicted to**T6**lex_item_choice**None**4**will>> be in 2018 (the USA - 7,5, the UK - 2, Germany - 6, China - 4,2) even though there <<is going to**T16**lex_item_choice**None**4**will>> be a decrease in numbers <<, except Germany where they will stabilize.**T7**Punctuation**None**54**except for Germany where they will stabilizestabilize.>>
<<The second point**T18**Articles**None**12**Second point>> which should be emphasized is that in all 4 countries the amount of money connected with the eBook market will also <<grow**T10**Redundant**None**7**grow up>>. <<In this position**T11**lex_item_choice**None**4**Here>> the USA will also <<be in**T12**lex_item_choice**None**7**present>> the first place. In Germany and China the numbers will <<increase by**T13**Prepositional_verb**None**11**increase on>> 0,5 billion dollars only (from 1 to 1,5 billion dollars in Germany and from 0,5 billion dollars to 1 billion in China).
