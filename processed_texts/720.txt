It is widely known that the majority of crimes are offended by the youth.It is an urgent problem of our contemporary society. In my essay I will focus on main causes and solutions to this issue.

To offer the most suitable solutions we need to go deeper into causes of this problem.One of the crucial factor is the consumption of drugs and alcohol which is increased among young people. The youth can't control themselves and their behaviour while being under the influence of alcohol.For instance,in Britain we can observe lots of fistfightings near pubs and clubs during night time.Moreover,the major part of the youth don't have enough knowledge about the danger of drugs and alcohol.That's why young people become drug addict.They have an urgent need to have money and to satisfy their addiction.It's a trigger to commit a crime.
There are variety of solutions which can help resolve this issue.Firstly,if the governments want to tackle this problem they should apply a much stricter system of penalties and punishments for offending crimes and also for the useage of drugs and alcohol. It might work,but in addition we need to improve our educational system.For example,teachers can learn students about safety,provide them with knowledge about narcotic substunces,drug and alcohol addiction.Furthermore, parents should control their children.They need to have a close-knit relationship with their children to prevent them from the danger of streetlife.
To sum up,the best solution is to increase the level of education in our countries and to develop our educational system.
