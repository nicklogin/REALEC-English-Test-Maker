These days the number of crimes committed by the generation of young people has significantly grown. The situation seems to be very dangerous and requires some particular actions.

Speaking about the causes of it, we should focus on some social problems which make teenagers and young people steal, burgle or even kill. Firstly, we should mention poverty. The lifestyle which doesn't let a person even know if he or she has some meal in a kitchen to eat for a day makes him/her steal because this sort of "earning money" looks as the quickest one. The main tragedy, as I believe, is that parents often teach their children do it. Many young families don't expect that to have children is a big responsability and then it turns out they are not able to feed their babies. Secondly,it lets many young people prove that they are at the same level with their peers, as risky and brave as they are. This is can be explained by lack of information, even isolation from society.

But still we can say that these problems can be solved. I assume that our government should pass some strict law about it. For example, I would propose exclude from school those guys who were constantly stealing some things/clothes/money or punish them by making clean the hall of school every day.Also, I believe that teachers should talk more about the adverse side of such "games", to consider some heroes from the world of literature, their destiny and concentrate on the fact of how some little crime affected their life. As for those who need money, I would offer to improve some services of social help and let these children eat for free at school.


In conclusion, I would like to say that these problems are very deep and there is no one decision for them. It is obvious that they require a lot of attention both from parents, teachers and from our government.
