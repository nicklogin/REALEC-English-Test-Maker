It is generally accepted that there should be a punishment for those who download pirate copies without paying mones. Because of this creators of music and film suffer a losses. This issue has always aroused sharp debates. I tend to agree with this statement completely.

The first thing that needs to be said is that people will continue to use pirate copies with current legislation. There are no rules for them. They know that they cannot be punished. A good illustration for this is a behaviour of a child. He will sceam and play loudly without any punishment from his mother.

Another argument in suppor of this is the good users of the content. There are somepeople who pay money for music and films. For example, someone will start to download these illegal files because everybody do it.

Last but not least, we also should say about unemployment. Producers of films and music cannot get money.They become to dismiss people. It leads to a lot of problems. For instance, there will be walkouts and protest.

We can notice the reduction of he range of good content for the maintaining of the production.

To draw a conclusion I would like to say that we should punish people, who do not want to buy and prefer pirate content.
