The data reveals information on tendencies of using Facebook between years 2012 and 2013. The prominent feature #DELETE#11#of the data appears to be <<its**T1**Spelling**None**4**it's>> diversification: we are shown not only <<mere**T14**lex_item_choice**None**4**bare>> figures of amount of users but also reasons for accesing the social network.

Just by a quick look at the vertical bar chart we can grasp two features in terms of amount of Facebook users.
Fir<<Firstly,**T15**Punctuation**None**7**Firstly>> are to admit that there is a significant rise in the percentage of users acc<<accessing**T2**Spelling**None**8**accesing>>e social network from mobile devices.

Speaking about another feature of this chart, the total number of Facebook users increased by the year 2013 but actually not so substantially as it was with the amount of mobile device users.

Here no such strict conclusions can be made instantly. However, a more detailed look at the chart provides us with the information the t<<that**T22**Often_confused**None**3**the>>most popular reason for accesing Facebook appeared to be sharing photos and videos.

Thus, by examining charts given we can conclude that overall popularity of Facebook between years 2012 and 2013 definitely increased by any #DELETE#12#means.
