Many people say that the widespread use of modern technology is causing <<the increasing number**T1**Articles**None**20**an increasing number>> of health <<problems**T2**Noun_number**None**7**problem>>. 

Many years ago people <<did not**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn’t>> use a lot of <<devices**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**subject>>, for example, TV or phone, and they <<did not**T5**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn’t>> have many <<problems**T6**Noun_number**None**7**problem>> with their health. But <<now**T7**Spelling**None**2**ow>> everybody uses <<a phone**T8**Articles**None**5**phone>>, netbook  every day and every hour, and they have <<eyes' diseases**T10**Possessive**None**13**eyes diseases>> or <<headaches**T11**Noun_number**None**8**headache>>. 

Also, a lot of modern computer <<games**T12**Noun_number**None**4**game>> for children  are wild<< because**T13**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> <<, when**T16**Punctuation**None**4**when>> children <<play**T14**lex_item_choice**None**4**gone>> <<them**T15**Ref_device**None**2**it>>, they forget <<everything**T17**lex_item_choice**None**6**simple>>, they <<do not**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> remember about their life, their family, their friends and they become very nervous and angry. They <<do**T19**Tense_choice**None**3**did>> many wild things and <<risk**T20**Tense_choice**None**6**risked>> their <<lives**T21**Spelling**None**4**live>>. #DELETE#4#Laos many people have <<headaches**T23**Noun_number**None**8**headache>><< because**T24**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> they often use their <<phones**T25**Noun_number**None**5**phone>> for <<listening to**T26**Prepositional_verb**None**9**listening>> music, when this music <<is**T27**Tense_choice**None**3**was>> very loud, people <<do not**T28**Tense_choice**None**6**didn’t>> stop music and <<then**T29**lex_item_choice**None**4**next>> they have <<headaches**T30**Noun_number**None**8**headache>>. In future we must <<spend**T31**lex_item_choice**None**4**used>> a lot of time <<in our phones**T32**Prepositions**None**10**our phones>>, TV, netbooks, and we will not have many problems with #DELETE#5#their health, I hope.
