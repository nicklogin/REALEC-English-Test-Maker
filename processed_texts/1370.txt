I <<do not**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> know what is ‘wide spread’ but I know that <<technologies**T2**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> #DELETE#24#and modern manufacturing is cause of a lot of health problems.

It is actually in cities, because <<every city**T5**Absence_explanation**None**4**city>> is <<a unique place**T6**Articles**None**12**unique place>> <<to live**T8**Infinitive_constr**None**10**for living>>, it is <<an antonym**T9**Articles**None**7**antonym>> for ‘wild routine’. Cities <<have**T10**Agreement_errors**None**3**has>> their own weather and climat, it is <<the first reason**T11**Articles**None**12**first reason>> of problems, like cold feats, but it is not <<the main one**T13**lex_item_choice**None**7**general>>. There <<are**T14**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> more massive problems<< like**T15**Punctuation**None**6**, like>> <<transport systems**T16**Absence_explanation**None**9**transport>> or factories.

Firstly, I <<will talk**T17**Tense_choice**None**4**talk>> about transport. It <<has**T18**lex_item_choice**None**4**call>> 2 types of problems: <<a temporary problem**T19**Articles**None**17**temporaty problem>> with health <<because of**T27**Prepositions**None**4**from>> <<the transport**T21**Articles**None**9**transport>> is, for example, if you are hit by <<a car**T22**Articles**None**3**car>> and now your arm is broken. <<The long-lasting problems**T24**Articles**None**21**Long-lasting problems>> <<because of**T28**Prepositions**None**4**from>> <<the transport**T26**Articles**None**9**transport>> <<are**T29**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> gases in <<the  air**T30**Articles**None**3**air>>, gases from engines, <<I cannot name**T32**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**cannot name>> a problem but I know <<that**T33**Ref_device**None**4**then>> <<breathing wasted by periods**T35**Word_order**None**27**breathing by periods wastes>> is not #DELETE#2#so helpful for your body. We can solve <<these**T37**Ref_device**None**4**that>> problems<< if**T38**Punctuation**None**4**, if>> we use <<electric-engines**T39**Spelling**None**15**electro-engines>> or something like that. Secondly, <<the big problem**T40**Articles**None**11**big problem>> <<are**T41**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> factories, of course. One factory can do a lot of things, legal or nor, that <<cause**T42**Agreement_errors**None**6**causes>> problems with our health. For example, <<a factory**T43**Articles**None**7**factory>> <<puts**T53**Agreement_errors**None**3**put>> wastes to <<the nearest lake**T45**Articles**None**16**the nearest lake>>, <<a fish**T47**Articles**None**4**fish>> in <<the lake**T46**Articles**None**4**lake>> eat wastes and <<becomes**T59**Agreement_errors**None**6**became>> not so good for eating, but we <<do not**T50**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> know it, and that fish <<is**T51**Tense_choice**None**3**was>> killed and served to our kitchen table, and after that we <<have**T52**Tense_choice**None**3**had>> stomach problems.

Well, modern <<technologies**T54**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> #DELETE#7#society causes a lot of troubles #DELETE#10#to routine, and sometimes we forget that we are <<a part of the nature**T57**Absence_explanation**None**6**nature>>, and we make problems for ourselves. <<The mankind**T58**Articles**None**7**Mankind>> makes troubles to <<itself**T59**lex_item_choice**None**7**mankind>>, and we must control this situation.
