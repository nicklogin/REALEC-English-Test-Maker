It is widely believed that illegal copies of films and music <<make**T1**Agreement_errors**None**5**makes>> its original creators lose a lot of money annually. People who listen to and watch these copies are also crimers. I don’t support this idea because people <<downloading**T2**Spelling**None**10**downloadin>> illegal files just use free information from the internet.
First of all, illegal pirates copying these files should be punished. I agree that sharing music or films in such <<a way**T3**Articles**None**3**way>> is <<a crime**T4**Articles**None**5**crime>>. It can be compared with <<a burglary**T5**Articles**None**8**burglary>>. But people <<using**T6**lex_item_choice**None**8**consumed>> these files just download it like any <<other**T8**Spelling**None**4**othe>> free information <<on**T9**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet. For example, I often listen to music in social networks <<, and**T10**Punctuation**None**3**and>> sometimes I <<don't even**T11**Standard**None**10**even don’t>> know that it’s downloaded illegaly. So it’s quite difficult to identify <<an illegal copy**T12**Articles**None**12**illegal copy>>.
Secondly, I believe that it is more rational to punish illegal pirates. Moreover, I consider <<, musicians**T13**Punctuation**None**9**musicians>> and <<film producers**T14**Spelling**None**13**filmproducers>> should save and protect their files more accurately. I think <<, strict**T15**Punctuation**None**8**strictly>> control in cinemas wouldn’t allow pirates to copy films. Musicians should keep <<the songs**T17**Articles**None**5**songs>> <<in secret**T18**lex_part_choice**None**10**in secrets>> from everyone before <<its**T19**Pronouns**None**2**it>> release. Nobody mustn’t have <<an access**T20**Articles**None**6**access>> to it.
Thirdly, to prevent illegal copying creators can make original disks cheaper. So, people will have an incentive to buy original record and listen or watch it in <<a good quality**T21**Articles**None**12**good quality>>. For example, it is <<better**T25**lex_item_choice**None**7**cheaper>> to buy the disk for 150 ₽ than to watch a bad copy of <<a film**T22**Articles**None**4**film>>.
Taking everything into account, it must be said <<: illegal**T24**Punctuation**None**7**illegal>> pirates are really theives but not ordinary people. Internet users just consume the information and files from the Internet sometimes even not knowing that it was <<copied**T25**Voice**None**7**copying>> illegaly.
