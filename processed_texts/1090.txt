It is often argued that contries should produce less the foods for import and more for themselfth. I don’t agree with this oppinion and I give some reason for and against.

First of all, many contries have only idea of modern technology and littel space for grothing plants. Their contries should save more food resurses which they produce and limited trancfer out meal. However a lot of contries don’t suffer from this issue, it is importent problm for all. Eech development contries usually earn and damage by own grounds, and that influence on the world. Thus we should save more products for ourself and less sell our producing food.

On the other hand, contries which use agro-cultures like average earing can’t stop or decrease import and sell because it influece bad on economic of conties.

In cocntution, It is very neccessory and diffcult question, In my view It is importent more food resurses spend on population eats and less on import.
