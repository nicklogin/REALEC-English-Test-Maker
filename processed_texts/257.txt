Nowadays, it is commonly believed that music and films can be downloaded via the Internet <<for**T1**Prepositions**None**2**by>> free. Workers of these industries are damaged by such unlawful actions because they lose <<an enormous amount**T2**Articles**None**15**enormous amount>> of profit. Individuals downloading files in such <<a way**T3**Articles**None**3**way>> are thought to be criminals, who must bear responsibility for this. I absolutely agree with this point of view and will discuss it in this essay.
First of all, <<creating**T4**Transitive**None**11**creating of>> a movie or recording an audio track takes lots of money, as well as time. Moreover, a huge amount of people should be involved in this process. As a result, producers of this product have to spend the huge part of the budget on wages. So, in order to gain some profit, they need their rights to be protected. People<< copying and sharing the result of their work for free**T5**Attr_participial**None**55**, copying and sharing the result of their work for free>>, in fact, steal their money, <<as if**T6**Conjunctions**None**2**as>> it was a pocket. That is why they must be punished as ordinary thefts.
Secondly, there are lots of special laws, which restrict distribution of non-original films and music. So, people who do it automatically become criminals. Moreover, buying discs from pirates means supporting their illegal actions. Consequently, buyers or people downloading films or music on the Internet also break the law and become guilty.
Overall, it can be concluded, that both music and film pirates and users of files<< distributed by them**T8**Attr_participial**None**22**, distributed by them,>> are thefts and must be punished. I think that the law system should be stricter to diminish the amount of illegal actions in this sphere.
