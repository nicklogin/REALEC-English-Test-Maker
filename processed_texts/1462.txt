So, we have a graph showing us <<the unemployment rate**T1**Articles**None**17**unemployment rate>> <<in**T2**Spelling**None**1**n>> several world’s regions. <<The graph**T3**Articles**None**5**Graph>> <<has**T4**lex_item_choice**None**5**takes>> data’s changes between 2014 and 2015. 

First of all, I should notice that in this graph we <<cannot**T5**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> see any global changes in <<the world's problem**T6**Articles**None**15**world’s problem>> of unemployment. We can see that <<the percentage**T7**Articles**None**7**percent>> of <<unemployed people**T8**lex_item_choice**None**11**unemployers>> in North Africa, South Asia and overall the world remains stable. So there is no difference in world’s unemployment rate between 2014 and 2015. 

Secondly, we can see a little fall of <<the unemployment rate**T9**Absence_explanation**None**12**unemployment>> in Middle East. <<I am**T10**Inappropriate_register**None**3**I’m>> not sure, but I think it depends on oil and <<gas**T11**lex_item_choice**None**8**gazoline>> money. Because the development of this industry gives people a lot of places for work. We can see the same fall of <<the unemployment rate**T12**Articles**None**12**unemployment>> in Latin America, so Europe remains the only region with <<the rising percentage**T13**Articles**None**17**rising percentage>> of unemployment. It is simply understandable, because today in EU we have a huge demography crisis. 

Summarizing all these facts, I can conclude without fluctuations, that worldwide percentage of unemployment <<remains**T14**Agreement_errors**None**6**remain>> stable or <<on allowable level**T15**Prepositions**None**15**allowable level>>. <<So,**T19**Punctuation**None**2**So>> <<in my opinion**T18**Prepositions**None**13**as my opinion>>, the solution of this problem <<cannot**T16**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> be <<the main goal**T17**Articles**None**11**a main goal>> of mankind nowadays.
