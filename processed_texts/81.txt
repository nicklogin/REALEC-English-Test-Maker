<<Robbers**T1**Capitalisation**None**11**The robbers>> <<have always been**T2**Tense_choice**None**11**always were>> a class of people who never get <<support**T4**Articles**None**9**a support>> of society #DELETE#9#in public: everyone <<understands**T6**Agreement_errors**None**10**understand>> its kind of <<a bad thing**T7**Noun_number**None**10**bad things>> to take stuff <<that**T8**lex_item_choice**None**5**which>> belongs to somebody <<, when**T9**Punctuation**None**4**when>> you have no right <<to do it**T10**lex_item_choice**None**6**for it>>. Actually, <<the twenty first century**T3**Articles**None**20**twenty first century>> changed  <<the world**T12**Articles**None**5**world>> #DELETE#6#around: <<now you don’t need**T14**Standard**None**18**you now don’t need>> to steal original discs <<, because**T15**Punctuation**None**7**because>> everyone can get access to them on <<the internet**T16**Articles**None**8**internet>> for free. So is it <<a rule**T17**Articles**None**8**the rule>> of <<a new reality**T18**Articles**None**11**new reality>> <<that we all should accept**T19**Absence_comp_sent**None**20**we all should accept>> or pirates should be punished for copying films and music?
On the one hand, we all understand that in <<the modern world**T20**Articles**None**12**modern world>> making music and films often is all about money. Authors spend a lot of recources <<on**T21**Prepositions**None**3**for>> studios, actors, marketing and so on, and they have a right to get their <<investments**T22**Noun_number**None**10**investment>> back with some kind of payment from society. And in this model, <<the internet**T24**Articles**None**8**internet>> is a factor <<that**T25**Often_confused**None**5**which>> blocks a huge amount of sales <<, because**T26**Punctuation**None**7**because>> some part of <<users of media products**T27**lex_item_choice**None**24**films and music auditory>> prefers to get this content for free and forgets about <<paying**T28**Category_confusion**None**10**payment to>> creators. While this happens, authors get less money than they could, so there is less motivation for them to create new interesting content. <<In this way of thinking,**T29**Punctuation**None**23**In this way of thinking>> it looks like we should say “yes, we need to punish pirates”.
But <<on**T30**Prepositions**None**4**from>> the other <<hand**T31**lex_item_choice**None**4**side>>, we should understand that the process of customer’s decision making is pretty difficult. People don’t want to spend money <<on**T32**Prepositions**None**3**for>> <<a thing**T33**Articles**None**5**thing>> they are <<little**T34**lex_item_choice**None**3**low>> informed about, but when we, for example, get <<a possibility**T35**Articles**None**11**possibility>> to <<listen to compositions of a musician**T36**Prepositional_verb**None**33**listen compositions of a musician>> for free, it’s easier for us to make <<a decision**T39**Articles**None**8**decision>> about <<buying**T40**Spelling**None**5**buyin>> tickets <<to**T41**Prepositions**None**2**at>> <<his**T42**Absence_explanation**None**3**his>> concert. So, free content may be a part of business.
As for me, we can do nothing with <<the fact**T43**Articles**None**4**fact>> that <<the internet**T44**Articles**None**8**internet>> changes markets, so content creators should learn how to change their models of <<monetization**T53**Spelling**None**12**monetisation>> and make them more suitable <<for**T45**Prepositions**None**2**to>> the modern world. <<So,**T46**Punctuation**None**2**So>> if people don’t want to pay for <<music disks**T47**Absence_explanation**None**5**music>>, we should check, for example, if they are ready to pay for ways to <<listen to it**T48**Prepositional_verb**None**9**listen it>> with comfort (like Apple music for iPhone). Creators need to <<make**T49**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> their <<suggestions**T50**Noun_number**None**10**suggestion>> to customers more <<diverse**T51**lex_item_choice**None**8**complexe>>. Or die.
