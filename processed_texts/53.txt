Nowadays there are <<lots of**T2**Agreement_errors**None**8**a lot of>> types of <<entertainment**T1**Spelling**None**13**intertainment>> that we can get from the Internet. Free films and music are only two of them. At the era of the fast Internet we can share different files almost without any limits. Due to this, the problem of illegal copying is arising today.
Some people think that spreading music albums and films on the Internet must be recognised as a crime, and people who <<committed**T3**Tense_choice**None**13**has committed>> that should be gone on trial. As for me, I totally agree with their position.
Firstly, any film, song or any other piece of art is author’s property. This means that, for example, only <<a director**T4**Articles**None**8**director>> can decide to whom he would sell or demonstrate his film. Copying this property is unacceptable. In modern democratic countries the power of law should protect <<the personal property right**T5**lex_item_choice**None**26**the right of self-property>> and punish those who violate the law. Moreover, it can be recognised as stealing money and labour from artists <<, which**T6**Punctuation**None**5**which>> is also illegal.
Secondly, copying and sharing music and films <<for**T7**Spelling**None**2**fo>> free can have a bad influence on the economy growth. <<Profits from the entertaining business**T9**Absence_explanation**None**21**entertaining business>>, which includes <<releasing films and music**T10**Absence_explanation**None**15**films and music>>, is usually a huge part of country’s income (for example, the USA). So, if you <<steal**T11**Spelling**None**5**steel>> films and songs, it is equal <<to**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**if you>> <<stealing**T13**Tense_choice**None**5**steel>> products and <<creating**T14**Tense_choice**None**6**create>> a kind of “black” or “shade” market on the Internet. The economy suffers a lot due to illegal transactions <<, because**T15**Punctuation**None**7**because>> it <<loses**T16**Spelling**None**6**looses>> masses of money <<, and**T17**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<product turnover is also damaged**T18**Absence_explanation**None**16**product turnover>>.
All in all, any type of <<stealing**T19**Spelling**None**8**steeling>> should be forbidden in modern countries. Copying and sharing music and films on the Internet is definitely a theft and <<has**T20**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> to be <<persecuted**T21**lex_item_choice**None**8**punished>>. Today <<nobody**T22**Capitalisation**None**6**Nobody>> doubts that <<stealing money**T23**Standard**None**14**money stealing>> is a crime and that you are not allowed to take someone’s property without paying for it. So why should we let internet <<thieves**T24**lex_item_choice**None**5**thefs>> commit their crimes and more? I strongly believe that there <<are**T25**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> no reasons for that.
