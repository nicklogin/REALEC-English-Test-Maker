A lot of people from music and cinema industry lose money <<because**T1**lex_item_choice**None**6**due to>> <<some people**T2**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**8**somebody>> <<send**T3**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**5**sends>> pirate copies to the Internet. People prefer to download films or music compositions and do not want to <<buy**T4**Spelling**None**3**bye>> <<the original versions**T5**Articles**None**17**original versions>> of files.

On the one hand, I can understand <<people who download files**T6**Defining**None**27**people, who downloads files>>. It happens because of <<prices**T7**Spelling**None**5**pries>> <<that are rising**T8**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**are rising>> so fast and people have not so much money for it. <<That is**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**6**That’s>> why in the beginning we find files in the Internet and only if we <<cannot**T10**Spelling**None**7**can not>> find something #DELETE#4#what we need, <<we buy it**T12**Conditionals**None**14**we will buy it>>. In various countries <<the industries**T13**Articles**None**10**industries>> have #DELETE#3#got different opportunities to control illegal process of making pirate copies. For example, in Russia <<you can find approximately all media files online**T15**Standard**None**49**approximately all media files you can find online>>. However, in Europe, as I know, it is hardly to do copies and, of course, to download them.

On the other hand, it is really bad when musicians and film makers lose their money. This is their work and it is understandable that they want <<to get**T17**lex_item_choice**None**7**collect>> money for their job. It is really difficult to work in this <<sphere**T18**Spelling**None**7**spheare>>. This job takes a lot of time, energy, emotions. Let’s think about this problem. For instance, one film producer <<have put**T35**lex_item_choice**None**5**spend>> a lot of money and <<effort**T20**lex_item_choice**None**5**power>> <<to make**T21**Prepositions**None**8**for make>> <<a film**T23**Articles**None**4**film>>, however, people download it and do not go to the cinemas, do not pay for original discs. <<That is**T25**Inappropriate_register**None**6**That’s>> why producers <<do not have**T26**Negation**None**7**haven’t>> more opportunities for making <<his**T27**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> films and due to pirates copies <<he**T28**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> <<loses**T29**Agreement_errors**None**4**lose>> <<his**T30**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> job. I suppose that <<the solution**T31**Articles**None**8**solution>> of this problem is decreasing prices.

<<In conlusion,**T32**Punctuation**None**13**In conclusion>> I want to say that all <<these**T33**Ref_device**None**4**this>> points of view can be right. <<None**T36**Redundant_comp**None**68**Now our general aim is happening people from music and cinema sphere>>.
