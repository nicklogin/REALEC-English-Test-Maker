The first point of view can exist, but I'm not absolutely agree. I don't believe that it can help to reduce crime, because prisoners can used to it, to approximately live in prison. Some prisoners don't care about stay in prison during a life or a few years. However, it's also a good p<<punishment**T1**Spelling**None**11**punichement>>anyway.
I agree with the other point of view that there are an alternative ways to reduce crime. I suppose that the most criminals spent their childhood in awful conditions with violence.
So when the<<they**T2**Spelling**None**3**the>>ow up they bec<<become**T3**Tense_choice**None**6**became>>ressive and desperate in life and start to commit crimes. I think that it's possible for government to take care of such families, invest money for the better future. I realise that it is not the best way to reduce crime, but it's a try. Another way I see is to make an influence on chi<<children**T4**Noun_number**None**5**child>>d tell them the consequences of commited crime. Also they should grow up in the warm and lovely atmosphere. I suggest that everything starts in the childhood. Moreover, there is a more rough way - death penalty, but I can't absolutely agree, because it can happen with the innocence prisoner, but anyway it's good way to scare criminals.

Of course there are a lot of ways to reduce crime, but all the tries will be useless, if the majority of people continue to think that they can do everything.
