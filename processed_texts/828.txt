In our modern world more and more teenagers are being involved in different <<types of crime**T25**Countable_uncountable**None**15**types of crimes>>. <<In this essay,**T16**Punctuation**None**13**In this essay>> I would like to discuss the reasons and probable <<solutions for this problem**T14**Prepositions**None**25**solutions of this problem>>.
The first cause of such behaviour can be v<<vulnerability**T15**Spelling**None**13**vulnurability>>of young people. They can be influenced a lot easier than children who still see their parents as authorities or adults who are more responsible for their actions and are aware of how they can e<<affect**T2**Word_choice**None**6**effect>>their future. The teenagers need t<<to be shown by all means that they are worth being respected**T17**Standard**None**60**to be shown that they are worth being respected by all means>> This is why they are being used in c<<committing**T4**Tense_form**None**9**commiting>>crimes. Another possible reason may be lust for money and l<<for luxurious life**T5**Prepositions**None**14**luxurious life>> If parents are not able to give their children money or if they are just poor, young people will try to seek for another opportunity to get t<<it**T18**Ref_device**None**4**them>> Since they do not have higher education, the only w<<way for some children**T6**Prepositions**None**17**way some children>>f<<to find it**T13**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**find>>is committing c<<crimes**T9**Countable_uncountable**None**5**crime>>

In<<In this case,**T26**Punctuation**None**12**In this case>>hey will learn that it is much better to help other people than to harm them in any way. Another variant may be opening some vacancies for young people either during summer time or in<<their free time**T22**Redundant**None**18**in their free time>>Through this important experience they will understand how hard it is to earn money and will not have to ask their parents for cash.
