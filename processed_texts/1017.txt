Many producers of film and musicians suffer losses anually because the Internet is a full of a pirate copies that are illegal. It is popular belief that person who download pirate files should be punished because he must buy the original document. In my opinion, people downloading illegal files should not carry a punishment, but it is necessary to level accusations for person who share these illegal copies in the web space.

To start with, today people use the Internet to gain an access to some films, musical albooms and other documents. Some of them are pirate and illegal. Formally, person downloading these files is a theft. But I believe that we could not identify this actions as illegal because person just save documents that are free and available on the Web. Consequently, person can not recognize the type of these copies and download them. In addtion, we could not define the set of crime because people are involved in complex web relationship.

I argue that responsibility in this situation should be laid on shoulders of people who distribute this content in the Internet. Firstly, it is really illegal action to share the films and musical files that have a copyright. Secondly, there we can define the set of crime because source and person may be revealed by web specialists.

Finally, downloading of illegal copies should also be prevented. The pivotal mean is to carry out a profound oversight for web pirates. But I should repeat there is no basis to punish person who just find and download copies, instead of buying the official version.

To sum up, saving of pirate copies can not be defined as a crime, because person just use the Internet as a source of files and documents. But people who share these illegal versions should be punished because it is really criminal action.
