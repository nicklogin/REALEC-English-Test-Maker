Nowadays a lot of people believe that the highly growing amount of health diseases <<are**T322**Spelling**None**2**as>> caused by using modern technologies all over the world. In this essay there will be represented some of the most important health problems and solutions to them.
First of all, the growing popularity of technologies can lead to some problems with your eyes and ears, because most of us, users of these so-called devices, are spending too much time playing video-games, watching TV and listening to music on a high volume. These difficulties can be prevented at <<an**T323**Articles**None**1**a>> early stage only by our self-control and some limits in time we use to play or listen to music.  
Another considerable and huge problem is caused by our lazy types of relaxing and spending free-time. It is believed that most of us prefer to use some types of machines at home, to do our house work, like washing dishes etc. Many of us also prefer to have a rest instead of doing some exercises, because in our modern world we have machines that can turn you "in shape" in a few weeks of using them. For this case you can educate yourself about some health problems, like heart-<<diseases**T324**Spelling**None**8**diceases>>, overweight, or any other types of difficuties you might face if you will spend all of your free time on just relaxing, eating, and sleeping, while your vacuum cleaner does all of your work. People should understand that our devices should not do everything instead of us and there is a limit. 
In conclusion, it is important to prevent all of the health problems caused by technologies, and this can be done only if people will have self-control and spend more time doing their work themselves.
