It is true that space exploration is very popular nowadays, but it is also a very expensive field. Most people think that <<the government**T16**Articles**None**10**government>> should pay more attention <<to**T1**Prepositions**None**2**on>> <<the social problems**T17**Articles**None**15**social problems>> rather <<than**T2**lex_item_choice**None**4**then>> #DELETE#2#on building new space ships, <<but**T4**lex_item_choice**None**5**while>> I <<do not agree**T3**Tense_form**None**12**am not agree>> with them.
In my opinion, space exploration is not a waste of money. Firstly, scientists do a lot of research in t<<space**T5**Articles**None**9**the space>> Thus, during such expeditions we can learn something new not only about different planets,#DELETE#1# but also about our own home. Secondly, it improves the way h#DELETE#3#ow we live. We would not have such common things today l<<as**T20**lex_item_choice**None**4**like>>television or the Internet without space exploration. In the near f<<future**T7**Spelling**None**5**futur>>we might have something new that will be absolutely i<<irreplaceable**T23**Spelling**None**12**irreplaceble>>
Nevertheless, some people are quick to point out that tr<<while trying to be the best in such fields governments forget**T8**Absence_comp_sent**None**55**trying to be the best in such fields governments forget>>bout real problems in their countries, for example, the le<<quality**T22**lex_item_choice**None**5**level>>f life, crime, homeless people an<<, and**T9**Punctuation**None**3**and>>ther social problems.
However, I believe that if the president, for example, decides that his country wants to be a part of space exploration tee<<team**T10**Spelling**None**4**teem>>e understands how much it will cost and he #DELETE#2#will never spend money that are<<is**T25**Tense_form**None**3**are>>n<<meant**T11**Spelling**None**4**ment>> #DELETE#5#be for social purposes. Otherwise, h#DELETE#1#e can loo<<lose**T24**Spelling**None**5**loose>>pport of his people.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that space exploration has its pros and cons. Personally, I think that it is a good idea to discover new planets and stars only ify <<if you**T15**Spelling**None**6**ify ou>>e enough money for it.
