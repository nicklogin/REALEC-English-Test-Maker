The chart given illustrates the situation on the print and eBook markets of different countries in 2014 and offers a prediction for 2018.
The obvious characteristic here is that in 2014 printed books market was remarkabely more developed then the market for eBooks everywhere. Yet the rise of the latter is the general trend forecasted for 2018 in all four countries.
The most striking detail is that the eBook market in the US is estimated to soar from 5,5 to 8,5 taking the leading position from the print market with only 7,5. Meanwhile, in other countries the print market will remain its leading position. Another trend is that Germany is the only country not to force the decrease in the print book market at all. Started from 6 in 2014, its numbers will have been stable by 2018.
