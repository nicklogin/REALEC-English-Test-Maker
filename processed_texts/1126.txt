The pie charts show the difference between goods transported by rail and by road in <<Eastern**T1**Spelling**None**6**Easten>> Europe in 2008.

As it can be seen from <<the charts**T24**Articles**None**6**charts>>, metals <<are**T2**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> <<most often**T28**Absence_explanation**None**4**most>> <<delivered**T3**lex_item_choice**None**8**provided>> #DELETE#9#materials by trains. <<they**T30**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**It>> <<make up**T51**lex_item_choice**None**5**takes>> 35%. By comparison, the percentage of metals transported by road <<is**T5**Spelling**None**2**in>> rather lower – only 11%. The second <<most often demanded**T33**Absence_explanation**None**8**demanded>> thing in railway transportation <<is**T34**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> manufactured goods – 25 per cent, <<which is aproximately equal**T35**Absence_comp_sent**None**25**which approximately equal>> to situation with goods transported by road. <<To be precise,**T51**Linking_device**None**12**In this case>> manufactured goods <<take**T6**Agreement_errors**None**5**takes>> 28% while food products <<constitute**T51**lex_item_choice**None**5**takes>> 30%. In the <<centre of the statistical range for goods transported by road**T39**lex_item_choice**None**40**middle of road transportation statistics>> <<there are**T51**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**are>> chemicals, non-metallic minerals <<, and**T11**Punctuation**None**3**and>> metals <<, while**T51**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<machinery, chemicals and food products are**T40**Absence_comp_sent**None**40**machinery, chemicals , and food products>> in <<the centre of the range in**T51**Absence_explanation**None**25**the cenre of the range in>> the first pie chart. Th most unpopular goods here <<are**T13**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> non-metallic minerals. <<However,**T14**Punctuation**None**7**However>> <<the percentage**T51**Absence_explanation**None**17**the percentage is>> rather higher than <<the percentage**T51**Articles**None**8**per cent>> of machinery <<in**T17**Spelling**None**2**if>> the second picture. <<They**T27**Ref_device**None**2**It>> <<make up**T51**lex_item_choice**None**5**takes>> only 2%.

Thus, manufactured goods <<are**T18**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>> <<delivered**T47**lex_item_choice**None**8**demanded>> by both methods but <<they are**T20**Ref_device**Dependent_change**7**this is>> not <<the most popular**T19**Articles**None**12**most popular>> goods. Metals <<reach**T51**lex_item_choice**None**5**takes>> the highest <<percentage**T22**Category_confusion**None**8**per cent>> in railway transportation, while food products <<hit**T23**Agreement_errors**None**4**hits>> a peak in road transportation. <<The least demanded goods**T49**Word_choice**None**19**The most undemanded>> goods are non-metallic materials in the <<first**T50**Spelling**None**3**1st>> chart and machinery in the <<second**T51**Spelling**None**3**2nd>> chart.
