Nowadays <<it is**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> a usual thing to buy a pirate copy of any film or music that you like or just to download them from the Internet for free.  But not so many people think about how much money musicians and film producers lose because of illegal <<sources**T2**Spelling**None**7**sowrces>> of their product.

On the one hand, some people think that people who <<do not**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> want to pay money for music and films and try to find them for free should be punished. Their position is clear, because <<, of course,**T4**Punctuation**None**9**of course>> people who create all these things <<get**T5**Tense_choice**None**3**got>> nothing for <<a lot of**T6**Inappropriate_register**None**7**lots of>> time, money and talent they needed to create that or another song or film, which is not really <<justly**T7**lex_item_choice**None**6**honest>>. <<Also,**T8**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> illegal copies bring lots of money to their owners, who in fact do nothing but copying the material created by others, so film producers and musicians have to deal with money problems connected with their art; whereas other people who <<do not**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> work as much as they are and just cell their works become very rich.

But on the other hand, illegal copies of music and films can be a good advertisement <<for people**T10**Prepositions**None**9**of people>> who created them. For example, you <<will not**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**5**won’t>> pay much money to go to a concert of a musician, whose art you <<do not**T12**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> know really well, but if <<it is**T13**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> your favorite singer, whose songs <<you have**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**6**you’ve>> accidently found in the Internet, <<of course,**T16**Punctuation**None**9**of course>> <<you will**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**6**you’ll>> buy a ticket even if it costs  a lot. <<Also,**T17**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> pirate copies can <<help people to be**T18**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**14**help people be>> noticed. Lots of famous musicians were found with the help of illegal audios of their works, which somebody published in <<his**T20**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> website. <<So,**T21**Punctuation**None**2**So>> sometimes people share their art for free <<by themselves**T22**Prepositions**None**10**themselves>> to become popular and reach success. 

To talk about myself, I agree with the second position<< because**T24**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> <<it is**T23**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> very difficult to become popular and, what is more important, stay popular only with the help of legal sources of your art. Today, in the 21st century, people are addicted to the Internet, they find everything there and <<cannot**T25**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> live without it. So <<it would be**T26**Tense_choice**None**4**it’s>> wrong to stop it.
