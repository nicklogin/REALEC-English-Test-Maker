The graph compares the percentage use of three social networks for four different groups of people separated by age.Overall, we can see that Facebook is the most popular network with people of all four groups, while LinkedIn attracts the least numbers of users among all groups.
A closer look to the data helps one find out that the patterns of percentage use of Facebook and Instagram are quite similar. We can notice that the younger the group is, the higher the share of Facebook and Instagram users among this group is. Thus, there are 87% young people from 18 to 29 using Facebook, while only 56% of old people over 65 years use Facebook. As for Instagram, the discrepancy between the percentage use of this network by young and old people is even more significant. The share of young users is about 9 times higher that the one for the oldest group.
On the contrary, the pattern of using LinkedIn differs a lot from those for two other networks. It is clear that LinkedIn attracts more middle-aged adults, who are from 30 to 64 years. The shares of Linkedin users in the youngest and the oldest groups are equal, and they are exceeded by about 8% by the two middle groups.
