It is the truth that musicians and film producers <<cannot**T1**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> get full income from selling their works because of the pirate files growing <<in the Internet**T3**Prepositions**None**15**on the Internet>> field every minute. 

I <<agree with**T4**Prepositions**None**5**agree>> that and disagree with this statement at the same time. From one point of view, <<artists**T5**lex_item_choice**None**10**art people>> can protect their <<author's rights**T6**Possessive**None**13**author rights>><< because**T7**Punctuation**None**9**, because>> they <<put**T8**lex_item_choice**None**7**involve>> a lot of power and time creating masterpieces<< from which their financial status depends**T10**Word_order**None**42** from which depends their financial status>>. On the other hand, I think that musicians and film producers must realize that art is non commercial by <<it's nature**T11**Absence_explanation**None**6**nature>> and <<it gives**T12**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**give>> not only money, but such things like self realization. Moreover, art <<products**T13**lex_item_choice**None**9**creatures>> is the main source of <<people's self education**T16**Possessive**None**37**people's lightuing and self education>>. <<To paraphrase**T25**Spelling**None**9**Parafrase>>, they must be responsible <<for the influence they have**T20**lex_item_choice**None**9**of impact>> on people, and if the masses accept and promote artworks, that indeed means <<the promotion**T21**Articles**None**9**promotion>> of the creator, it must reveal only good feelings. What  comes to me, I <<cannot**T22**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> always <<permit myself to buy**T23**Verb_Inf**None**23**permit to myself buying>> some album or film <<, that is**T25**Inappropriate_register**None**6**that’s>> why I use illegal files from the Internet like all people.
