Many people have <<absolutely**T1**Spelling**None**9**absolutly>> <<different**T2**Spelling**None**10**differente>> reasons to do crime, they could be <<protect**T4**Spelling**None**8**protecte>> <<themself**T5**Spelling**None**9**themselfs>> or their family. However, <<there are**T7**Confusion_of_structures**None**5**it is>> <<enough**T6**Spelling**None**7**enought>> <<murderers**T8**Category_confusion**None**6**murder>>, <<who**T9**Pronouns**None**5**which>> kill people just for fun or for pleasure in the world or people<< who have psychological problems**T10**Punctuation**None**32**, who have psychlogical problems>>.
For the first one it could be e<<enough**T14**Spelling**None**7**enought>>a<<to spend a few years in the prison**T15**Absence_comp_sent**None**25**a few years in the prison>> because they did the wrong step and must b<<take**T16**Voice**None**8**be taken>>punishment. But i<<, in my point of view,**T17**Punctuation**None**19**in my point of view>>it is necessary to try the death penalty in our country for the people, who rape t#DELETE#3#he children and kill them, because they are heavy sick and it is not changing b<<in**T19**Prepositions**None**2**by>>t#DELETE#3#he time.

Of co<<course**T25**Spelling**None**5**cours>>there are some alternative ways of reducing not so#DELETE#2# heavy crime - it's society work. I guess, that it's good solution: person, who choose the wrong way, can be ad<<improved**T27**lex_item_choice**None**8**advanced>>y helping people and society.
