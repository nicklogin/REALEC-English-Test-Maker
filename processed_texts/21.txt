It’s evident nowadays that there is a big problem on the media market. Also it’s important to understand that it’s quite complicated to be aware of all transactions that happen on day-to-day basis in the sphere of buying and selling music and films. But some people think that everyone should respect <<the literary property**T23**lex_item_choice**None**25**the author’s piece of art>> and <<to buy it legally**T1**Standard**None**17**to legally buy it>> as they buy food or clothes. Others claim that the Internet is <<a place**T2**Articles**None**9**the place>> where you can get all <<the media content**T3**lex_item_choice**None**15**the media stuff>> you want without paying for it because everyone does exactly the same thing.
To my mind, it’s fair and morally <<justified**T4**Suffix**None**12**justificated>> to pay for <<someone else's work**T5**Possessive**None**19**someone’s else work>> <<, no matter**T6**Punctuation**None**9**no matter>> what type of work you’re dealing with. Firstly, it takes a lot of time for musicians and film producers to create <<a piece of art**T7**Articles**None**16**the piece of art>>. They do a lot of work, spend money on <<the process of making a product**T21**Absence_explanation**None**18**the making process>> and <<advertisement**T11**Spelling**None**12**advertisment>>, try to understand their audience. Secondly, intellectual property is protected by the law and everyone who doesn’t follow the <<judicial system’s rules**T12**Category_confusion**None**24**judiciary system’s rules>> should be punished. Thirdly, it’s really important to protect the unique feature of musical and film industries <<, when**T16**Punctuation**None**4**when>> only the ones who are ready to pay for <<an access**T13**Articles**None**6**access>> to <<art**T14**Articles**None**6**an art>> should <<get**T15**lex_item_choice**None**4**take>> this opportunity.
However, some people assume that everyone should get an access to films and music because it’s impossible to destroy the market of pirate copies and in this case all the limitations don’t make sense. I totally disagree with this point of view because there is an improvement of <<a law system**T17**Articles**None**10**law system>> and the system of <<controlling the market**T18**Noun_attribute**None**16**market’s control>> <<, and**T19**Punctuation**None**3**and>> the amount of pirate copies decreases.
All things considered, I totally believe that musicians and film producers should get the whole amount of money for their work <<, and**T20**Punctuation**None**3**and>> everyone who ignores <<the intellectual property law**T21**Noun_attribute**None**32**the law of intellectual property>> should be punished.
