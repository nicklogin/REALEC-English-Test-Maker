Recently some countries have become <<concerned with**T7**lex_part_choice**None**15**concerned about>> the invention of a system which could provide people with guaranteed income. Some people may argue such a system can be beneficial for the society, while others believe it may be even harmful. I suppose this issue <<requires**T1**Spelling**None**9**requieres>> more careful consideration.

On the one hand, if a "Guaranteed basic income" system is or<<implemented**T9**lex_item_choice**None**9**organised>>it will have certain advantages. Firstly, every person will be pr<<protected**T2**lex_item_choice**None**9**prevented>>rom absolute poverty, as they will receive minimal income on a monthly basis.For instance, they can spend this money to buy products or to pa<<pay rent**T10**Redundant**None**12**pay for rent>>Secondly, such an idea will be beneficial for home-staying mothers, especially for those who are the only breadwinners in the family, because they sometimes st<<struggle trying to find a job**T11**Absence_comp_sent**None**22**struggle to find a job>>Furthermore, this system is to help elderly people and teenagers to become more independent from other members of their family.

On the other hand, when people receive money regardless of the situation, they may face several problems. First of all, the government will need to increase taxes to comp<<compensate for**T12**Absence_comp_colloc**None**10**compensate>> money which were<<will be spent**T5**Tense_choice**None**10**were spent>>m the budget. Moreover, people might feel deprived of the impulse to find a job or a better job, as they will be financially secure. Nevertheless,the desire to improve the quality of life usually main<<maintains**T13**Spelling**None**10**maintaines>> same level in a<<throughout**T14**lex_item_choice**None**2**in>> society.

To conclude, although implemention of this system may have several drawbacks, it is likely to provide citeze<<citizens**T3**Spelling**None**8**citezens>>a necessary sum of<<amount**T4**lex_item_choice**None**3**sum>>ney, which sometimes can save their lives and even make them better. Therefore, I suppose advantages of this system will outweigh the drawbacks.
