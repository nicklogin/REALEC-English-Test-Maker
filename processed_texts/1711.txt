The bar chart illustrates the proportion of money spent on <<printed books**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**printed>> and <<eBooks**T1**Spelling**None**7**E-books>> relatively in <<the USA**T5**Articles**None**3**USA>>, Germany, China and <<the United Kingdom**T6**Articles**None**14**United Kingdom>> in 2014 and gives a prediction of the change in these figures. Overall, there is an obvious downward trend in all four countries concerning both paper and digital items.
Regarding the data of 2014, <<it must be noted that print market**T2**Absence_comp_sent**None**29**it must be noted print market>> was more successful in four cases. It reached the biggest popularity <<in the USA**T4**Articles**None**6**in USA>> rising up to 10,5 billion dollars, whereas <<Great Britain**T7**lex_item_choice**None**7**England>> demonstrated the lowest rate for this section, accounting only 2,6 billion dollars. <<eBook**T9**Spelling**None**6**E-book>> production was of a very small scope in China (only 0,5 billion dollars), Germany and <<the UK**T8**Articles**None**2**UK>> had <<approximate values**T13**Word_choice**None**17**proximate figures>>, however, <<eBook industry in the US**T12**Confusion_of_structures**None**21**the US eBook industry>> was also rather productive.
Turning to the forecast performed, one may assume that print book production will experience a significant fall in the USA. Nonetheless, <<values**T14**lex_item_choice**None**7**figures>> for this section in other three countries will not change drastically, remaining approximately at the same level. The level of money spent on <<eBooks**T15**Spelling**None**7**e-books>> will rise in all the countries presented hitting a peak in the USA at 8,5 billion dollars.
