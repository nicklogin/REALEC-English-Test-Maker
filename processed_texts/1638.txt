People argue#DELETE#1#: <<whether or not**T14**Linking_device**Dependent_change**2**do>> modern technologies do harm to our health #DELETE#6#or not.
<<In my opinion,**T17**Punctuation**None**14**In my opinion,>> modern technologies cause an increasing number of health problems. They are mostly connected with <<eyesight**T18**lex_item_choice**None**6**vision>>, <<back problems**T28**Articles**None**8**our back>> and obesity. <<If we define modern technologies as computers and smartphones,**T30**Punctuation**None**61**If we define modern technologies as computers and smartphones>> then I think that they really do harm. Firstly, computers and work connected with <<sitting**T3**Often_confused**None**7**seating>> <<lead to**T21**lex_item_choice**None**5**cause>> less active lifestyle. It means that there are <<fewer calories**T32**Comparative_constr**None**13**less calories>> <<burnt**T31**Word_choice**None**5**spent>> and there is less blood <<circulation**T4**Spelling**None**11**cerculation>>. These are the causes of obesity. <<Another**T33**Determiners**None**9**The other>> reason why smartphones and computers do harm to us is that they spoil our <<eyesight**T34**Word_choice**None**6**vision>> if we use them too much.
<<On the other hand,**T5**Punctuation**None**17**On the other hand>> some people say that modern technologies are able to improve <<lives**T6**Spelling**None**5**lifes>> of many people who were not able to <<cope**T35**Word_choice**None**4**deal>> with their deseases until modern technologies <<appeared**T7**Spelling**None**7**appeard>>. They <<imply**T36**Word_choice**None**7**suppose>> that modern technologies develop medicine and in <<this**T23**Ref_device**None**6**such a>> way do good to us.
I <<am not going to**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don't>> <<overrate**T38**Word_choice**None**6**impose>> my <<opinion**T37**Spelling**None**8**oppinion>> but still I think that <<gadgets**T10**Ref_device**None**4**they>> cause health <<problems**T9**Spelling**None**8**proplems>>. But those problems can be reduced by proper usage of gadgets. We should be more active <<while we work**T39**Confusion_of_structures**None**15**during our work>> on computers, we should <<sit**T11**Often_confused**None**4**seat>> properly <<at**T12**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the desks.
To sum it up, I think that modern technologies <<have increased**T25**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**4**made>> <<the number**T29**Articles**None**6**number>> of <<health**T27**Spelling**None**5**heath>> problems #DELETE#4#more, #DELETE#24#but these problems more, but these problems <<have become**T40**Tense_choice**None**6**became>> less dangerous due to <<these technologies**T28**Ref_device**None**4**them>>.
