Nowadays you can read about crimes <<committed**T1**Spelling**None**8**commited>> by young people in the news every day of the week. The problem is stated more serious than ever. What are the causes of this situation? How can parents and teachers help to solve this problem?
Nowadays people often do not spend enough time teaching moral to their children. The reason why young people start <<committing**T2**Spelling**None**9**commiting>> crimes is the absence of understanding the <<consequences**T3**Spelling**None**12**consecuenses>> of their behavior. Children should be taught not only about punishments for criminals, but also about impact of crime on ordinary people.
On the one hand, parents should teach their children that if everybody <<were**T4**Tense_choice**None**8**would be>> kind to each other, there would be no crime and nobody would suffer from thefts, nobody <<would be**T5**Tense_choice**None**7**will be>> killed or hurt. But if <<somebody**T6**Often_confused**None**7**anybody>> starts to break the law, <<stimuli**T7**Suffix**None**7**stimuls>> for other people to do the same things appear. The net effect leads to <<the development**T8**Articles**None**11**development>> of illegal business. That means that every criminal <<doesn't only harm**T9**Tense_form**None**14**not only harms>> people with illegal actions but also stimulates the crime.
<<However,**T10**Punctuation**None**7**However>> <<learning**T11**Category_confusion**None**12**the learning>> moral aspect is not enough. Young people should be taught at school which actions are legal <<, and**T14**Punctuation**None**3**and>> which are not <<, and**T15**Punctuation**None**3**and>> which <<kinds**T12**Spelling**None**5**kings>> of <<punishment**T13**Noun_number**None**11**punishments>> follow different crimes. This side of education helps to exclude the situations when people commit <<a crime**T16**Articles**None**5**crime>> without understandind the fact that they are breaking the law.
All things considered, the problem of crime development should be solved through education, which <<consists of**T17**Prepositional_verb**None**13**consists from>> two equally important parts: moral aspect and learning the law. <<The first thing**T19**Articles**None**11**First thing>> should be <<taught**T18**Derivation**None**7**teached>> by the family, while <<the second one**T20**Articles**None**10**second one>> can be <<taught**T21**Derivation**None**7**teached>> by school teachers.
