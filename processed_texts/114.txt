The graph below illustrates the percentage use of three different social networks: Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn, by online adults in the USA by their age.
There are some major trends observed in the information given. First of all, it is obvious that Facebook reaches the highest score within every age group among all three social networks. Moreover, the percentage use of Facebook in the least age group, 65+ years old, is higher than any of the scored reached by the highest age groups in Instagram or LinkedIn, making Facebook even more popular with the crowd. 
Besides, it is noticeable that the age group of 65+ years has the smallest percentage use of all the three social networks, suggesting the fact that elderly people are least interested in any of them.
Finally, LinkedIn turns out to be the only social network in which the percentage use of the 30-49 age group is higher than this of the 18-29 age group, which might be a proof for the fact that middle-aged people are more interested in a professional social network than in an entertaining one, whilst younger people seem to have less passion in it. 
Overall, the statistics completely match with the expected results of the research.
