There is no doubt that travelling by air transports has totally transformed our lives. It is difficult for everyone to imagine the sky <<without planes**T44**Prepositions**None**13**with no plane>>, to go on <<long trips**T45**Articles**None**12**a long trips>> and voyages only by train <<or**T46**Conjunctions**None**3**and>> <<by car**T47**Prepositions**None**3**car>> as these vehicles <<seem too slow to us**T11**Standard**None**16**seem us too slow>> now. Despite air transport <<being**T13**Infinitive_constr**None**2**is>> really useful, it produces poisonous emissions in the air and <<provokes**T19**lex_item_choice**None**14**contributes to>> global warming.
To my mind, it would be great if our government c<<created**T20**Conditionals**None**6**create>>some laws to reduce air p<<pollution**T27**Noun_number**None**10**pollutions>> It is obvious that the problem of pollution is connected with an enormous amount of different kinds of transport. Actually, this issue is caused not only by air transport. In such cities like Moscow the biggest part of these emissions is produced by private and public transport that everyone u<<uses**T21**Tense_form**None**3**use>>everyday.

For instance, nowadays there is a quick development of vehicles that work from electricity or from alternative energy resources, but not everyone will change their own comfortable transport o<<for**T17**Prepositions**None**2**on>>such e<<electric**T18**Category_confusion**None**11**electricity>>cars as they are quite expensive and difficult to charge (in Moscow there i<<are**T33**Tense_form**None**2**is>>no special stations for charging electric transport).
