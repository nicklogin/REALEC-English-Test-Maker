<<According to**T1**Prepositions**None**9**According>> <<the recent survey**T2**Articles**None**13**resent survey>>, there are a lot of people<< who think that all modern technologies cause huge health problems**T3**Defining**None**67**, who think that all modern technologies cause huge health problems>>. What are those problems and how the modern world is trying to cope with them?

Firstly, there are still a lot of people who think that <<a mirctowave**T5**Articles**None**9**microwave>> can cause some serious health problems, so they throw it away from their houses or just try not to <<use it**T6**Absence_explanation**None**3**use>>. Although this modern technology <<has**T7**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> some bad impact on <<people**T9**Articles**Dependent_change**9**the human>>, it is not so dangerous and there is no need in regecting a microwave. <<So,**T10**Punctuation**None**2**So>> to cope with this problem there is a need in educating people and popularisating some modern <<researches**T11**Spelling**None**9**resercies>>. 

Secondly, people, <<who spend a lot of time in front of their computers**T12**Defining**None**51**who spend a lot of time in front of their computers>> can have some problems with their eyes. This problem can be solved by creating a computer or monitor which will not have such <<a bad impact**T13**Articles**None**10**bad impact>>. 

Finally, modern smartphones have become a huge part of our <<lives**T14**Spelling**None**5**lifes>> and some people <<worry**T15**Tense_choice**None**11**are worring>> aout <<the impact**T16**Articles**None**11**that impact>> that smartphones cause. The modern <<generation**T17**Spelling**None**9**eneration>> <<cannot**T18**Spelling**None**7**can not>> imagine their <<lives**T19**Spelling**None**5**lifes>> without their phones and this is a kind of addiction. There is no doubt that for some people it is a serious problem, and they need some medical and <<psychological**T20**Spelling**None**13**phichological>> help, but should we do something with the <<whole**T21**Spelling**None**4**hole>> generation is still the main question that <<have been discusses**T22**Tense_choice**None**12**is discussed>> already for years. 

To sum up, modern technology <<simplified**T23**Tense_choice**None**14**are simplyfide>> our lives, but they <<cause**T24**Tense_choice**None**11**have caused>> some huge problems too. We cannot regect using technologies, but wee must try to reduce the impact that <<they**T25**Spelling**None**3**the>> cause by inventing better technologies or modernisating some old ones.
