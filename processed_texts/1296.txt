Many people say that the widespread use of modern technology <<causes**T1**Tense_choice**None**10**is causing>> an increasing number of health problems.

It is evident that people living in an urban world constantly suffer from <<wide range of illnesses and diseases**T2**Articles**None**38**a wide range of illnesses and diseases>> caused by modern #DELETE#10#developing technology.

There are many health problems that people nowadays come across with. Firstly, it is very complicated to cope with the stress which urban life provides people with. It is hard to calm down being stucked in <<traffic congestions**T5**Articles**None**21**a traffic congestions>> <<the reasons of that**T6**lex_item_choice**None**12**which causes>> lies deep down in human’s desire to build more roads, and to have a nice expensive car to show off #DELETE#5#about. Secondly, everyone nowadays is aware that <<the ecology**T8**Articles**None**7**ecology>> of our planer <<in a very bad state**T9**Prepositions**None**22**is at a very bad state>>. The <<suggestion**T11**lex_item_choice**None**7**willing>> to demolish old cultural buildings in order to build more plants and factories <<ends badly because**T12**lex_item_choice**None**22**end in a bad condition>> of air no one can breath, #DELETE#26#in air and water pollution which is very harmful for people’s health.

Although, there are many ways to solve this problem. Firstly, people should reduce their desire to be able to consume every popular or fashionable piece of modern technology in order just to blend in a crowd and not to feel sorry for yourself not having a new expensive toy to play. A lot of health problems can be solved by simply <<refusing**T14**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**12**giving up on>> <<to go**T15**Tense_choice**Dependent_change**5**going>> to work by car <<and choosing**T13**Conjunctions**None**8**choosing>> a bicycle instead. <<Furthermore**T16**Spelling**None**10**Futhermore>>, people should understand that it is <<everyone's personal**T17**Absence_explanation**None**10**everyone’s>> duty to preserve nature and to try to prevent <<pollution situation**T18**Absence_explanation**None**9**pollution>> from getting worse. <<Focusing on**T19**Prepositions**None**11**Focusing in>> buiding cultural facilities more than plants and factories can be a great solution for reducing air and water pollution. As a result, people <<will breath only fresh air**T20**Word_order**None**26**will only breath fresh air>> and drink clean water setting their mind on beautiful things and challenging thoughts <<and avoding stress**T21**Conjunctions**None**15**avoiding stress>>.

To sum up, modern technology influences people’s health in a bad way. However, there are certain things that can be done in order to reduce illnesses and all the responsibility #DELETE#8#to do it lies entirely <<on**T23**Prepositions**None**2**in>> people’s shoulders.
