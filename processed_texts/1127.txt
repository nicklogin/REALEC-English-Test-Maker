There are a lot of <<people who think**T26**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**people think>> that technological progress leads to problems with health.

Of course, some of innovations may <<affect**T27**lex_item_choice**None**8**decrease>> our health. For example, our vision becomes worse because of regular <<use**T5**Category_confusion**None**5**using>> of computers or phones, our ability to #DELETE#4#beat hear is damages by music <<with the volume turned to the maximum**T28**lex_item_choice**None**15**in a big volume>>. But <<are these**T7**Ref_device**None**5**is it>> problems of modern technology? How can we <<influene**T8**Transitive**None**12**influence on>> solving this problem?

First, we should remember that <<we are responsible**T9**Absence_comp_sent**None**14**we responsible>> for taking care of ourselves and we should control our <<habits**T1**Spelling**None**7**habbits>> which can <<affect**T10**lex_item_choice**None**8**decrease>> our health. If we know that long-term <<use**T11**Category_confusion**None**5**using>> can lead to some problems, we should <<reduce it**T12**lex_item_choice**None**11**use it less>> even if we do not want to do it. Second, we should always read instructions from <<manufactures**T14**lex_item_choice**None**8**creators>> of <<equipment**T13**lex_item_choice**None**10**technology>> in order to know all possible <<consequences**T29**lex_item_choice**None**5**cases>> and <<the ways to prevent them**T30**Word_choice**None**25**the ways of their solving>>. Each <<device**T31**lex_item_choice**None**10**technology>> has its own <<safety warning**T32**Absence_comp_colloc**None**7**warning>>, so we always may get to know activities we should not or <<must not do**T33**Modals**None**14**must not to do>>. Also, if it can decrease health, we will learn if from instruction. The third argument is we can switch to <<eco-friendly**T34**Absence_comp_colloc**None**3**eco>> <<innovations**T2**Spelling**None**11**innocations>>. Most of them <<have been created**T15**Tense_form**None**7**created>> with <<the purpose**T16**Articles**None**7**purpose>> not to damage the environment and not to <<damage**T17**lex_item_choice**None**8**decrease>> peopleâ€™s health. Technological progress <<allows us to by**T18**Verb_Inf**None**13**allows us buy>> more and more <<safe**T19**Category_confusion**None**6**safety>> things, which have no bad influence on people. We should focus on this area as investors, developers, creators or customers. 

Thus, technology may <<have**T20**Modals**None**3**has>> <<a bad influence**T21**Articles**None**13**bad influence>> on our health, but it is only our responsibility to control the <<level**T22**lex_item_choice**None**6**number>> of <<the influence**T23**Articles**None**9**influence>>. We should <<seek solutions**T35**Word_choice**None**27**be solution oriented people>> if we want to stop it. Modern world gives us <<an opportunity**T24**Articles**None**11**opportunity>> to make <<the right choice**T25**Articles**None**14**a right choise>> or create something new. <<To conclude,**T36**Linking_device**None**2**So>> if we want to solve this problem, we will do it.
