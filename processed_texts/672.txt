Nowadays there are too many crimes in our cities and towns, because the life level is really low and <<economical situation**T1**lex_item_choice**None**7**economy>> of our country is not so <<stable**T2**Category_confusion**None**9**stability>>. So, the main question in this problem is how to punish this criminals.
First o<<of**T3**Spelling**None**3**off>>all, the way of thinking of many people is like that: criminals must be in prison for a long time. From my point of view, it is a good solution of the problem because these people won't do other bad actions in future. However, I think,<< that it is not nesseccary to make good conditions in the prison becausee there are people who killed and robed**T4**Punctuation**None**110**, that it is not necessary to make good conditions in the prison because there are people who killed and robed>> They a<<do**T7**Verbs**None**3**are>>not pay attention to the law, so we need not p<<to pay**T8**Infinitive_constr**None**3**pay>>attention to their c<<conditions**T9**lex_item_choice**None**12**conditionals>>
Fr<<On**T10**Prepositions**None**4**From>>he other hand, there is al<<an alternative**T11**Articles**None**11**alternative>>ay of punishment: it is reabilitation.

In prison they can work and after a few years they be<<will become**T16**Tense_choice**None**6**become>> normal people. In my opinion, it is a strange way of punishment due to this conditions. It is<<looks like**T17**Modals**None**12**is look like>>h#DELETE#4#at they are not in prison but they are in th<<their**T19**Spelling**None**5**theit>>ormal life, where they can wa<<walk**T20**Tense_choice**None**7**walking>>wo<<work**T21**Tense_choice**None**7**working>>wa<<watch**T22**Tense_choice**None**8**watching>>V and en<<enjoy**T23**Tense_choice**None**7**enjoing>>heir life style.
In con<<conclusion**T24**Spelling**None**9**conclusin>>he best way of pun<<punishment**T25**Spelling**None**11**punishement>> think, is being in prison for a long time. Although, alternative way is <<exists**T26**Voice**None**8**is exist>>t is reabilitation, but it is too "soft" for criminals.
