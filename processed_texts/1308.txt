It is argued that the extension of technologies can be harmful <<for**T1**Prepositions**None**2**to>> <<health**T2**Articles**None**10**the health>>: the more people use modern devices – the more opportunities they have to get ill. This essay agrees with this view. Firstly, this essay will discuss the examples of problems which individuals may get, and <<, secondly,**T3**Punctuation**None**9**secondly,>> this essay will look at possible solutions to these problems. 

To begin with, modern technologies <<help people to solve**T4**Verb_Inf_Gerund**None**17**help people solve>> different problems with less effort. It is harmful <<for**T5**Prepositions**None**2**to>> their health because they have less reasons to get up from their beds and do something. The <<widespread use**T6**Absence_explanation**None**10**widespread>> of the Internet causes a problem when people do not want to <<get out of**T7**Prepositional_verb**None**7**get out>> their houses and meet other people or just do some sports – they prefer to sit on the couch with ordered food and chat through the Internet. <<It**T8**Ref_device**None**4**This>> leads to less activity in <<life**T9**Articles**None**8**the life>> and <<a big opportunity**T10**Articles**None**15**big opportunity>> to be overweight because of it. The small problem of a few kilos to loose can turn into obesity. 

This problem has different solutions. Firstly, individuals can use less modern technologies to connect with each other – this will not only reduce the possibility to be overweighed because of <<the increase**T11**Articles**None**8**increase>> of activity in their <<lives**T12**Noun_number**None**4**life>>, but <<, also,**T13**Punctuation**None**4**also>> there will be a development in social interactions. Moreover, another solution depends on modernization <<, people**T14**Punctuation**None**6**people>> should invent more technologies which will help people stay <<fit**T15**Spelling**None**3**fir>>, for example, playing tennis with a <<tv**T16**Spelling**None**2**Tv>> with help of modern technologies imitates the real game <<, and**T17**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<it**T18**Ref_device**None**4**this>> trains muscles and helps to avoid obesity. 

In conclusion, there are several health problems caused by the extension of modern technologies. However, these problems can be solved in the nearest future.
