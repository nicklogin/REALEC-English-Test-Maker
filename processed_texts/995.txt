The members of music or film industry lose money every year by costumers who use illegal pirate copies. Some people think that such custumers must be punished. But some suppose that this situation should not be paid attention. To be honest, I support the first group of people.

Firstly, the original discs and legal music, for example, in Itune store are not so expensive. So for ordinary people this money is not so significant. But for musicians and film producers it is a salary for their hard work.
       
Secondly, if this situation will not change in future, the number of crimminals will increase. And society will not follow other laws, too. To add this statement, I want to say that the goverment have to controll such crimminal and make more strictly punishments for them.

Moreover, 2 years ago I saw a documental film about the same crimminals. The main idea of this movie was the fact that if people continiue to download different files, films or music by the Internet, music and movie industry will not make relevant materials and wonderful content of these works. Because they will not have money, which producers pay for creating products.
To emphasize once again, I would like to say that many people suppose that such crimes with illegal downloading products are not so significant. But I strictly know that this is the first step to commiting harder and bigger crimes, which have an unpositive influence on society and on people in it.
