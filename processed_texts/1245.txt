The pie diagrams <<show**T1**Agreement_errors**None**5**shows>> the comparrison of <<the shares**T2**Noun_number**None**6**shares>> of different types of goods <<transported**T3**Category_confusion**None**14**transportation>> in Eastern Europe <<in**T4**Prepositions**None**2**by>> the year 2008. Overall, there is <<a significant difference**T5**Articles**None**22**significant difference>> in <<the structure**T6**Articles**None**9**structure>> of <<these**T7**Ref_device**None**4**this>> charts. The railroad transportation is related more <<to**T8**Prepositions**None**4**with>> <<the heavy products' industry**T9**Articles**None**24**heavy product's industry>>, <<unlike**T11**Linking_device**None**10**instead of>> road transportation, which is more suitable for food and <<light products**T12**Absence_explanation**None**5**light>> industry. 

The metals transportation is #DELETE#2#in more than three times bigger on the rails<< than**T14**Punctuation**None**6**, than>> <<on**T15**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the road. The food <<products' shares**T16**Possessive**None**15**products shares>> <<depict**T17**lex_item_choice**None**11**the figures>> <<the opposite situation**T18**Articles**None**18**opposite situation>>, and the <<food's share**T19**Possessive**None**10**food share>> is just a third part of <<the road's share**T20**Articles**None**12**road’s share>>. Manufactured goods take quite <<a similar part**T21**Articles**None**13**simmilar part>> in both types o transportation, having 25% on the rail and 28% on the road. We can calculate that <<the share**T38**Noun_number**None**6**shares>> of non-metallic minerals in the rail transportation is 6%, which is only a half of road’s shares (13%). Chemicals have <<the difference**T38**Spelling**None**9**differens>> in 5% #DELETE#13#by its shares in two types of transportation, and the most significant difference has the rate of Machinery’s shares: <<rail transportation**T27**Absence_explanation**None**4**rail>> have <<a six times bigger number**T28**Articles**None**21**six times that number>><< than**T31**Punctuation**None**6**, than>> <<road chart**T38**Noun_attribute**None**14**the road chart>> shows (12% and 2%). 

All in all, there is a large number of reasons<< which could explain the difference in the structure of transportations by rail and road**T34**Defining**None**89**, which could explain the difference in the structure of transportations by rail and road>>. Rail <<transportations**T37**Noun_number**None**14**transportation>> are specialized on metals and machinery, meanwhile <<road**T38**Spelling**None**4**read>> transportation is chosen for food products and non-metallic goods. In other types they are quiete the same.
