The use of illegal drugs in sport is becoming more widespread nowadays. The society has two opinions on this problem. Some people think that sportsmen that were caught should be banned for a limited period, others that such athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives.
On the one hand, the elemination of drugged athletes is a honest way of punishment. The question is how strong should be this punishment. As for those who think about the banning from competing professionally for the rest of live, I think, it must be a worth reason for this. That is why I suppose that only judge can take a decision after a good work other such ease. Moreover, there are different reasons or health problems that make an athletes to do take drugs. Furthermore, nowadays the competion between athletes is so hard, because of different drugs they take. That is why they use to take drugs for being faster or stronger. In my opinion, the judge should take a decision after working other the case and the aspects that cause drugging.
On the other hand, there are athletes that are drugging during all their sport career, and they are doing this intentionally for getting the best score. Besides they get all best prizes, they are not the best and cannot be without taking a drug. Taking different legal medicaments is a normal thing for athletes because they should be always in form. Where is this last point, which can make the athletes stop?
To sum up, I'd like to prupose that may be a special council that will work on the cases of such athletes. I think that there are cases, when the punishment is enough for two years, for example, but also there are athletes who need much more, and banning from competing for the rest of their life is the best way for their career. The sport shouldn't be a drugged competition!
