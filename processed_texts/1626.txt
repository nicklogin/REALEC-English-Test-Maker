It is argued that <<the rising number**T4**Articles**None**13**rising number>> of human diseases is caused by using technologies. This essay agrees with this statement. Firstly, this essay will discuss problems with health, <<and secondly,**T40**Punctuation**None**12**and secondly>> ways of <<solving**T5**lex_item_choice**None**8**reducing>> these problems.
To begin with, modern technologies such as computers, mobile phones <<significantly**T39**Spelling**None**12**significanly>> <<influence**T6**Transitive**None**12**influence on>> <<our health**T7**Determiners**None**6**health>>. <<They**T8**Ref_device**None**2**It>> <<affect**T30**lex_item_choice**None**11**deteriorate>> our vision. A lot of children suffer from <<problems**T2**Spelling**None**8**promlems>> with their eyes already in the first <<grade**T3**suggestion**None**5**class>>. Secondly, <<gadgets**T37**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>> have <<a devastating effect**T38**Articles**None**18**devastating effect>> on <<human**T35**Category_confusion**None**7**human's>> heart. The impulses <<which come from gadgets**T19**Defining**None**24**which come from gadgets,>> ruin our nervous system and <<affect**T14**suggestion**None**11**deteriorate>> <<heartbeat**T31**Spelling**None**10**heart beat>>. Furthermore, technologies weaken our organism <<, and**T333**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<, as a result,**T34**Punctuation**None**11**as a result>> <<a huge amount**T334**suggestion**None**15**the huge amount>> of harmful substances reach our organism and deliver a lot of illnesses #DELETE#12#and microbes.
<<This**T12**Agreement_errors**None**5**These>> wide range of problems can be decreased by human efforts. Firstly, people should <<reduce**T45**lex_item_choice**None**8**decraase>> time<< which**T18**Defining**None**7**, which>> they spend <<on**T46**Prepositions**None**4**with>> <<gadgets**T16**Spelling**None**7**gadjets>>. It <<will reduce**T44**Tense_choice**None**6**reduce>> harmful <<effects**T47**Noun_number**None**6**effect>> on our <<body**T10**suggestion**None**8**organism>>. Secondly, scientists should improve technologies <<in different ways**T48**Word_choice**None**30**using different details for it>>. They can make the screen less <<harmful**T20**lex_item_choice**None**11**devastating>> <<for**T41**Prepositions**None**2**on>> <<eyesight**T22**lex_item_choice**None**6**vision>>. Finally, people can <<increase**T23**Prefix**None**8**decrease>> <<the distance**T24**Articles**None**8**distance>> between them and computers. For instant, individuals can watch movies not only in front of computers or TV, but sitting on <<a sofa**T25**Articles**None**4**sofa>> or <<not closer than**T49**Comparative_constr**None**8**not near>> one <<metre**T15**suggestion**None**4**metr>> <<from**T42**Prepositions**None**11**in front of>> <<the screen**T51**Ref_device**None**2**it>>.
In conclusion, <<overusing**T17**suggestion**None**13**wide range of>> technologies <<brings about**T21**suggestion**None**7**induces>> <<a number**T53**Word_choice**None**14**the big amount>> of human illnesses. Despite this fact, people are not able to <<give up**T28**lex_item_choice**None**6**escape>> <<using them**T29**Absence_explanation**None**4**them>> but they can reduce it using different methods and approaches<< which**T33**suggestion**None**7**, which>> are <<suggested**T43**suggestion**None**7**created>> by scientists and <<adopted by ordinary people**T49**Lack_par_constr**None**15**ordinary people>> respectively.
