The line graph illustrates the average maximum and minimum temperatures in two cities, which are Yakutsk, Russia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

It can be clearly seen from the graph that <<the average temperatures**T1**Articles**None**20**average temperatures>> grow from January to July and decrease from July to December. <<The temperatures**T2**Articles**None**12**Temperatures>> on the second graph decrease slowly from January to June, <<then**T3**Often_confused**None**4**than>> stay on the <<same**T4**lex_item_choice**None**3**one>> level between June and September and rise from September to December. <<The average maximum temperature**T5**Articles**None**27**Average maximum temperature>> in Yakutsk <<is higher**T6**Tense_form**None**6**higher>> <<than**T7**Often_confused**None**4**then>> <<the minimum**T8**Articles**None**7**minimum>> <<by**T10**Prepositions**None**3**for>> about 10 degrees in February, April, May, September, October <<, and**T9**Punctuation**None**3**and>> November. <<In**T11**Prepositions**None**2**On>> <<the summer months**T13**Articles**None**13**summer months>> it is higher <<by**T12**Prepositions**None**3**for>> about 15 degrees. And in January and December the difference is 5 degrees. On the second graph, which shows average temperatures in Rio de Janeiro this difference is about 15 degrees on the whole timeline. Average temperatures in Yakutsk are lower than in Rio de Janeiro. In summer months the difference is about 10 degrees, while <<in**T14**Prepositions**None**2**at>> winter months <<the difference**T15**Articles**None**10**difference>> is about 65 degrees. <<The difference**T16**Articles**None**10**Difference>> between maximum and minimum average temperatures in Rio de Janeiro is higher.
