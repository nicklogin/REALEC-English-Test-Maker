It is assumed that youngsters are prone to break the law more often than the prior generations used to. Several reasons for that can be provided and some solutions can be offered.

First of all, it is widely supposed that modern teenagers have lost the sense of responsibility for their actions. Some of them are overprotected by their parents and that may cause their obcene behavior. Parents should spend more time and effort to explain them the basics of norms that are accepted in the society.

What is more, children that are brought up in a family of alcoholics or drug-addicted parents usually copy their lifestyle. They are nurtured in the atmospere of hatred and cruelty and consider it normal. These young victims can be saved with the help of social service, psychologists and teachers who can truly take care of them and save them from possible future of criminals.

In addition, some movies and video games may affect a child`s flexible mind.
Those that contain murders, rapes, harassment which escape the punishment, may seem realistic to a young player or viewer and trigger him to do the same. Parents can control the content that attracks their children and also convince them that the events shown in films and games are fiction and turning them into life may cause terrible consequences.

To sum up, the rising number of crimes commited by teenajers is a serious social problem. However, following the recommendations given, their intentions to break the law can be prevented at early stages.
