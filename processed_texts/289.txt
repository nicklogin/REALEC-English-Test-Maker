Each day brings us new emotions and new feelings. This fact is also suitable for the modern audio and video spheres. New types of music and films are appearing even while I’m writing this essay. <<As a result,**T1**Punctuation**None**11**As a result>> there are lots of materials to be bought, but people don’t want to spend money <<on**T2**Prepositions**None**3**for>> it. They prefer just to download illegal <<pirate**T3**Spelling**None**5**pirat>> copies and watch or <<listen to**T4**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> everything at home. Let’s think <<about whether they should be punished or not.**T5**Abs_comp_clause**None**36**about should they be punished or not>>.
<<To be honest,**T6**Infinitive_constr**None**9**Be honest>>, I’m a person<< who never buys official materials in shops**T7**Defining**None**44**, who never buys official materials in shops>>. That’s why I totally disagree with the point about punishments. First of all, people<< who download music or films from the net**T8**Defining**None**42**, who download music or films from the net>> don’t want to pay a lot of money for it in brand shops. That happens <<because**T9**Spelling**None**7**becouse>> of products’ price. It’s extremly huge and can really <<damage**T10**lex_item_choice**None**4**hurt>> your budget.
<<To prove my point of view,**T11**Punctuation**None**25**To prove my point of view>> I ask you to imagine the following situation. You came to the media shop <<, and**T13**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<your**T12**Spelling**None**3**you>> eyes couldn’t see all of films presented there. So, <<what would you have chosen?**T15**Punctuation**None**26**what would you have chosen>>. How would <<you**T16**Spelling**None**4**youd>> <<have decided**T17**Tense_choice**None**6**decide>> what to buy? Would you <<have taken**T18**Tense_choice**None**4**take>> a film<< which costs 800 rubles or even more**T19**Defining**None**39**, which costed 800 roubles or even more>>? Well, let’s imagine, that you bought one. Then you came home and couldn’t wait to see a perfect film! But… You turned it on and in the first the minutes you <<understood**T22**Tense_choice**None**10**understand>> <<that**T23**Spelling**None**4**thit>> it was awful. What <<would your emotions have been**T24**Tense_choice**None**18**were your emotions>>? Talking about myself, I <<would have felt**T25**Tense_choice**None**10**would feel>> sorry about wasting my time and my money. <<To prevent such situations,**T26**Punctuation**None**26**To prevent such situations>> I prefer to watch films online and then, if I <<like**T27**Tense_choice**None**5**liked>> it, I <<will**T28**Tense_choice**None**5**would>> go to the shop and buy it.
And what about people, who doesn’t have an <<opportunity**T29**Spelling**None**11**opportunito>> to listen to music or watch <<a film**T30**Articles**None**4**film>> at all? He doesn’t have any money for it. <<Does it mean that they should forget about media sphere?**T31**Punctuation**None**56**Does it mean that they should forget about media sphere.>> <<i**T32**Spelling**None**1**A>> guess no. And <<pirate**T33**Spelling**None**5**pirat>> copies is the solution.
<<To conclude everything,**T34**Punctuation**None**22**To conclude everything>> I want to say that copying and sharing music or films through the <<Internet**T35**Capitalisation**None**8**internet>> isn’t a theft. <<This is**T36**Abs_comp_clause**None**4**This>> just a way to be common and to have the same opportunities as other people have. That’s why I think that downloading illegal copies <<shouldn't be punished**T38**Tense_form**None**23**shouldn’t been punished>>.
