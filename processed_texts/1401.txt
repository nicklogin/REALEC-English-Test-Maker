There is a popular point of view<< that**T1**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> widespread use of modern technology leads to <<the growing**T2**Articles**None**14**growing number>> of <<diseases**T3**Spelling**None**8**deseases>> in the world. There are some problems and solutions of them.

Firstly, most of modern gadgets<< which people use in everyday life**T4**Defining**None**36**, which people use in everyday life,>> have a bright display. Frequent <<interactions**T5**Noun_number**None**11**interaction>> with bright light and small signs <<affect**T6**Transitive**None**9**affect on>> <<human's health**T7**Possessive**None**12**human health>>. It leads to a lot of different eye <<diseases**T8**Spelling**None**8**deseases>> and <<problems with**T9**Prepositions**None**11**problems in>> <<the nervous system**T10**Articles**None**14**nervous system>>. Moreover, every day we are surrounded by many kinds of radiation, such as wi-fi or mobile phones. Scientists <<have not**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**7**haven’t>> researched enough is it harmful for health <<or**T12**Spelling**None**2**of>> not #DELETE#3#yet. Besides, <<when a person is surrounded by different gadgets,**T14**Punctuation**None**48**when a person is surrounded by different gadgets>> <<he**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**2**he>> <<becomes**T16**Agreement_errors**None**6**become>> distracted, annoyed and stressed and it <<affects**T17**Transitive**None**10**affects on>> <<their**T18**lex_item_choice**None**1**a>> health in a bad way.

For example, the first problem <<has**T24**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> the simplest solution – to wear a special glasses and use harmful gadgets lees frequent. The second one is more difficult. Scientists should research electricity pylons<<, which have a bad influence on people,**T25**Defining**None**39**, which have a bad influence on people,>> who also live nearly there. The another solution is more personal. If every person could control their own use of modern technologies and consciously use it less, <<the total level**T26**Articles**None**11**total level>> of stress, depression and suicides <<would decrease**T27**Conditionals**None**9**decreased>> dramatically.
