It’s <<well-known**T1**Articles**None**12**a well-known>> that musicians and producers have a lot of money from illegal <<pirate**T2**Spelling**None**6**pirete>> copies. Someone <<thinks**T3**Agreement_errors**None**5**think>> that people who <<copy**T26**Confusion_of_structures**None**7**copying>> and <<download**T6**Spelling**None**7**downald>> files on the Internet should be punished, but I think that it’s not <<a really good solution**T7**Articles**None**20**really good solution>> of <<the problem**T8**Articles**None**7**problem>>.
Firstly, many <<musicians**T9**Spelling**None**8**musicans>> and film producers <<etc.**T10**Redundant_comp**None**8**and etc.>> <<become**T11**Spelling**None**6**bocome>> popular because their music and films can <<be seen**T12**Verb_part**None**9**be seeing>> free <<on**T13**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet. <<In our time, the Internet is the most popular place where we spend our time and make different things like watching films and listening music.**T20**Punctuation**None**156**In our time, the Internetthe Internet is the most popular place where we spend our time and make different things like watching films and listening to music>> Furthermore, not all people can buy the original disc with music and films, when in the websites there are free versions.
In conclusion, I want to say that I disagree with <<the given opinion**T22**Articles**None**13**given opinion>> that people who <<share**T4**Confusion_of_structures**None**7**sharing>> the files with music and films <<on**T23**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the Internet should be punished. <<I think that it is normal in our times.**T25**Punctuation**None**38**I think that it is normal in our times>>
