In Africa <<the unemployment**T1**Articles**None**12**unemployment>> reached its peak of <<12,5%**T2**Absence_explanation**None**4**12,5>> and remained steady until 2015, but the same cannot be said about the situation in the Middle East, where <<the unemployment rate**T3**Articles**None**17**unemployment rate>> <<declined**T4**Tense_choice**None**7**decline>> over the period. In Europe only <<7,5% of**T31**Prepositions**None**4**7,5%>> people were unemployed <<, and**T7**Punctuation**None**3**and>> their amount <<had increased**T8**Tense_form**None**12**had increase>> slightly by 2015. In Latin America there was <<a moderate decrease**T9**Articles**None**17**moderate decrease>> of unemployment from 6,8% to <<5,8%**T10**Absence_explanation**None**3**5,8>> over the year. In Asia there <<was**T11**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> a steady <<small**T12**lex_item_choice**None**3**low>> amount of unemployed <<people**T13**Spelling**None**6**peoply>>, only 3,9% by 2015, and it <<was**T14**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> rather better than situation in North Africa where percentages of unemployed people <<was**T15**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> remarkably high. <<The situation**T16**Articles**None**9**Situation>> in Asia <<was**T17**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> also better than in the Middle East, where we see <<a steady high level**T18**Articles**None**17**steady high level>> of unemployment, <<although**T21**Conjunctions**None**12**nevertheless>> there <<was**T19**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> <<a modest decrease**T20**Articles**None**15**modest decrease>> of it.
In conclusion, the worldwide level of unemployment <<was**T22**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> <<steadily**T23**Category_confusion**None**6**steady>> rather high. But <<the graph**T24**Articles**None**5**graph>> shows that all over the world (instead of Africa) the level of unemployment <<had been declining**T25**Tense_choice**None**12**is declining>> slightly or it <<was**T26**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> steady and not very high. So, we may hope<< that**T27**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> by 2020 there <<will have been**T28**Tense_choice**None**7**will be>> <<an extremely low level**T30**Articles**None**19**extremely low level>> of unemployment. I mean, it <<can**T31**Modals**None**5**could>> reach its lowest point.
