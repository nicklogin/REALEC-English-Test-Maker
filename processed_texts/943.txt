In the modern world young people commit more crimes than #DELETE#6#it was previously. I presume that the main causes of such <<changes**T1**Often_confused**None**11**development>> are dramatic increase in technologies, <<their**T2**Pronouns**None**4**its’>> availability for wide masses and, as a result, <<young people's**T5**Word_order**None**16**lower engagement>> in social interactions #DELETE#15#of young people.
To start with, now children and adolescents spend much less time <<outdoors**T6**Often_confused**None**7**outside>>, playing football or any other sport with their <<coevals**T7**lex_item_choice**None**9**covenants>>. As a result, their communication has altered its form and transferred from streets to computers: it is a fact that young people nowadays communicate using social networks more, than in the real life. Besides, the development of online entertainment industry, <<namely**T22**Redundant_comp**None**10**and namely>> computer games development, has a significant impact on lack of socialisation among adolescents. Moreover, computer games like shootings or fightings, as well as many videos <<on the Internet**T23**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>>, promote violence towards young people’s minds. All this negative phenomena <<influence modern society harmfully**T19**Word_order**None**36**influence harmfully a modern society>>.
However, parents and teachers can solve this problem. The <<former**T17**Adjectives**None**7**formers>> should not allow their children to spend too much time with their computers and other devices, as well as they should restrict time <<spent**T8**Voice**None**8**spending>> in social networks. Furthermore, parents have to <<spend more time outdoors with their children**T16**Absence_explanation**None**29**walk more with their children>>, encourage them to do <<sports**T9**lex_item_choice**None**5**sport>> and <<to interact**T10**Verb_Inf**None**8**interact>> with other children. The <<latter**T18**Adjectives**None**7**latters>>, teachers, should offer to pupils such interesting topics that would encourage them to study rather than play computer games. Moreover, group projects can increase <<students**T14**Possessive**None**8**students>> engagement in studying and interacting with each other <<, too**T15**Punctuation**None**3**too>>.
To sum up, <<the rise**T12**Articles**None**4**rise>> in <<the quantity**T13**Articles**None**8**quantity>> of <<committed by younger people**T21**Absence_explanation**None**6**crimes>> is a great problem and parents and teachers should try to <<solve**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**6**tackle>> this problem.
