However, all these problems, in my opinion, can be reduced in some ways. Scientists nowadays have already invented special glasses that help to protect peopleâ€™s eyes from the negative impact of screens. In order to prevent problems which are connected with back and information volume people should give themselves some breakes  during the work. They can go <<outside**T1**lex_item_choice**None**13**to the nature>> and relax or just do some gymnastics.
