<<A. Orlenko**T1**DET**None**3**The>> pie charts illustrate <<information**T162**Articles**None**15**the information>> about transportations of goods between Eastern <<European**T163**Category_confusion**None**6**Europe>> countries in 2008. Overall, the <<data**T165**lex_item_choice**None**5**dates>> from <<the charts**T164**Articles**None**6**charts>> are not the same.
First of all, the pie charts consist of 6 sectors: manufactured goods, machinery, metals, chemicals, <<non-metallic**T166**Spelling**None**12**non metallic>> minerals and food products. They analyze railway and road means of transport. It can be <<pointed**T167**Voice**None**5**point>> out that 35 percent of metals were transported by rail when only 11 percent of them were transported by road. The percentage of transportation of manufactured goods <<was almost the same**T168**Abs_comp_clause**None**15**almost the same>> at both charts. <<There**T169**Ref_device**None**2**It>> can be seen the big difference between machinery and food products transportation, where the difference is more than 10%. <<However,**T170**Punctuation**None**7**However>> this indicator between chemical goods and non-metallic minerals is slightly different.
To summarize, the percentage of transportation of <<goods**T171**Countable_uncountable**None**4**good>> is rather <<volatile**T174**Spelling**None**8**volotail>> and <<depends**T172**Tense_form**None**6**depend>> on <<the mean**T173**Articles**None**4**mean>> of transport.
