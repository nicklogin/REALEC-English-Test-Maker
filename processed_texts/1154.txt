Nowadays our technologies are extremely <<overcome**T1**lex_item_choice**None**11**increase in>> our needs. Moreover, there are lots of films and musics appeared <<on the Internet**T3**Prepositions**None**15**in the Internet>> in illegal <<way**T4**Spelling**None**3**was>>. Some people consider that it is a crime, but others use them with <<pleasure**T5**Articles**None**10**a pleasure>>. 

Nevertheless, I disagree with <<people who think that it is a theft**T6**Defining**None**40**people, who think that it is the a theft>>. First, buying the original <<discs**T10**Noun_number**None**4**disc>> of music and films <<is**T9**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> highly expensive. Moreover, our Internet provides a lot of <<opportunities**T11**lex_item_choice**None**11**possibility>> to watch films <<or**T12**Spelling**None**2**of>> <<listen to**T13**Prepositional_verb**None**6**listen>> music in the cheapest way or for free. Furthermore, it is very hard to wait for the <<appearance**T14**Category_confusion**None**9**appearing>> of new  <<films**T15**Noun_number**None**4**film>> on disks, which <<are**T16**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> very popular in society. Therefore, the production of disks cannot race with surfing <<the Internet**T17**Articles**None**8**Internet>>. 

There is a second side of this problem, #DELETE#4#that our society <<depends**T19**Voice**None**10**was depend>> on financial <<possibilities**T20**Spelling**None**13**possabilities>>. There <<is**T21**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> a huge amount of people who cannot satisfy their needs or make themselves happy. For example, I have some friends<< who camnot allow themselves to go to the cinema  many times**T23**Defining**None**64**, who cannot allow themselves to go to the cinema for many times>>. Although, it is quite easy <<to download films for free**T27**Standard**None**31**to download for free this films>>. There is another positive point for the unguiltiveness of pirates and <<those who**T30**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**who>> use their files is that some newest films and songs <<decrease**T32**Voice**None**13**are decreased>> in <<the level**T31**Articles**None**5**level>> of intellectual <<ideas**T33**Noun_number**None**4**idea>>. For example, our film production consists of silly comedies <<mostly**T34**Category_confusion**None**12**for the most>>. Therefore, some films <<do not satisfy**T35**Voice**None**15**are not satisfy>> after seeing them in the cinema. <<In this case**T36**Punctuation**None**12**In this case>>, there is a perfect solution to solve the problem is to download them for the cheapest way at home <<from the Internet**T37**Prepositions**None**16**for the Internet>>. Moreover, this is the best decision to upward your mood. 

To sum up my mind, I believe that downloading films and music is not a serious problem in our world, <<comparing**T39**lex_item_choice**None**9**according>> to pollution, unemployment or other crimes. Sometimes it has a positive effect on <<the mood**T40**Articles**None**4**mood>> of people. In my opinion, these <<thefts**T41**Noun_number**None**5**theft>> cannot be compared to <<crimes**T42**Noun_number**None**5**crime>> life violeness or killers. We live in <<a modern world**T43**Articles**None**12**modern world>> and <<the Internet**T44**Articles**None**8**Internet>> is a part of our life.
