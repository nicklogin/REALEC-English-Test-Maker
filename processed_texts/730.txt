Sport is very popular nowadays. People not only like to do it, but to watch sports. I think that most of the people has his favourite sports team or sportsman, whom you like to cheer up and to whom you wish more wins. But there are some people who think that watching sports is not an important activity for our lives. I disagree with them and that is why.
First of all, when people attend some sports events or just get together and watch championships online, they feel like they belong to something global. They feel connection between each other and it seems like they are one big family. They really are. Remember when in Ancient Greece Olympic games were started, wars were paused? Do you understand the great importance of it? Sports events connect people and create peace in the world.
Secondly, watching sports inspire us to create wonderful things. I mean that when you watch how sportsmen are playing and then winning the prize, you understand how really hard they worked for it, so it makes you get out of bed and you start doing sports, or you start trying to study more, or make your career grow. Sport is like art - when you watch it, you feel inspired and refreshed.
Finally, you even can make a career while watching sports! For example, you can become a sports events commentator, or a sports journalist. There are a lot of ways to find a job in sports sphere. If you are really interested in sport and you understand what it is made of, then you should not blow your chance to get in the sports industry!
In conclusion I would like to say that you are not wasting your time while watching sports. How something can be a waste of time, if it makes you happy and inspired?
