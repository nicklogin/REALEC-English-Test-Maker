Lets talk about <<the transportation**T34**lex_item_choice**None**8**logistic>> by rail in Eastern Europe in 2008. <<As I see from the monogram,**T3**Punctuation**None**26**As I see from the monogram>> <<the most popular**T4**Superlative_adj**None**16**the main popular>> product is <<metals**T5**Noun_number**None**5**metal>>. <<The second position**T34**lex_item_choice**None**12**Second level>> <<is taken by**T9**Prepositions**None**8**is taken>> manufactured goods. <<The third position**T34**lex_item_choice**None**11**Third level>> is taken by <<machinery**T12**Capitalisation**None**9**Machinery>>. And the last  <<ones**T13**Noun_number**None**3**one>> are chemicals, food products, non-metallic minerals. It <<reveals**T14**lex_item_choice**None**5**shows>> that for <<the train transportation**T34**Absence_explanation**None**5**train>> <<it is more actual**T17**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**more actual>> <<for more**T18**Prepositions**None**4**more>> heavy products. 

Now we will <<look at**T19**lex_item_choice**None**8**research>> <<the other**T20**Often_confused**None**7**another>> <<transportation**T21**lex_item_choice**None**8**logistic>> system by road. Of course, the <<leaders**T22**Noun_number**None**6**leader>> of this charts are food products and manufactured goods. On the next stage are chemicals (16%), non-metallic minerals (13%), <<metals**T23**Noun_number**None**5**metal>> (11%). And the most unnesasery is machinery.
