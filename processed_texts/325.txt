Every person<< who earns money**T1**Defining**None**18**, who earns money,>> does it in their own way <<, and**T2**Punctuation**None**3**and>> for musicians and producers it is selling their music or film products. Nevertheless, these products are often treated as ones that should be available for anyone. So, is it fair to call pirate copying a theft and, consequently, should people<< who make film or music copies and spread them**T3**Defining**None**48**, who make film or music copies and spread them,>> be punished?
Once John Lennon said that music should be for each and every one. I strongly agree with him and add that any kind of art should be available for masses <<, and**T4**Punctuation**None**3**and>> I have a couple of thoughts to support my point of view.
First of all, I tend to think that rising the intelligence level of masses or remaining it <<at**T5**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the high level is of great importance. If we block ourselves from almost the whole art sphere, we will probably return to the Medievals when human thought and art <<were**T6**Agreement_errors**None**3**was>> in deep crisis. The new Dark ages in XXI century is nonsense so calling the interest in music or film products a crime is not the right thing to do.
Secondly, I consider that musicians and producers have much more ways to earn money than just by selling films and records. For instance, musicians go on tour and give concerts <<, and**T7**Punctuation**None**3**and>> filmmakers have an income while their works are shown in <<cinemas**T8**Derivation**None**14**cinematheatres>>.
Taking everything mentioned above into consideration, I believe that by blocking free access to art works people of these industries block themselves from all the money they could earn. Because who would pay money for the unknown and who would go to a music performance if very few people know whose the performance is?
