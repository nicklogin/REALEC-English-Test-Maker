This chart shows us the unemployment rate in different world regions in 2014 and 2015.

First of all, as we can see the colour of year which are suggested different. Also, regions are quite specific. The number of unemployment given from N. Africa, Middle East, EU, Latin America, S Asia, worldwide.

So, the first bar shows N. Africa and the unemployment here is same in 2014 and 2015. The percent is 12,5 in both charts. The second position has Middle East which is not same: 11 percent and 9,6 percent. the difference is not so big but shows that 2015 was better for people. After that the EUâ€™s chart where the number of unemployment people increased from 7,5 to 7,9 percent. The fourth bar refers to Latin America where we can notice that in 2015 where employment had quite good position: from 6,8 to 5,8 percent. But the best number came from S. Asia where unemployment does not raise. they have only 3,9 percent per year. And the last one is worldwide bar which is quite clear every year and has only 5,9 percent of people who have not places to work in.

So, all in all the highest percent of unemployemnt is is North Africa and the lowest in South Asia. Difference between them is 9,6 percent which is mind blowing. Despite the fact that Asia has the biggest population in the world they still have places to work.
