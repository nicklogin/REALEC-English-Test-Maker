Crime <<has always been**T8**Standard**None**10**always was>> the most serious problem for mankind. There were different ways of its reducing, but now people try to find the solution and they separate on two groups - one of them believes that <<increased**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**growing>> prison sentences <<will help**T5**Tense_form**None**10**will helps>> us, <<another**T6**Spelling**None**6**anoter>> one <<supposes**T7**Agreement_errors**None**7**suppose>> that it is not the best idea and there is <<a better way**T8**Articles**None**10**better way>> to solve that problem.
