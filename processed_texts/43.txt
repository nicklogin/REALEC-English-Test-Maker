Many people <<say**T1**Tense_choice**None**6**saying>> that there is a big problem with illegal pirate copies <<of**T2**Prepositions**None**4**with>> music and films. Musicians and film makers <<lose**T3**Tense_choice**None**10**are losing>> a lot of money from this type of coping and sharing without official buying the original discs. So the idea is that people who <<download**T4**Tense_choice**None**11**downloading>> illegal copies from the internet should be punished.
Every human <<in**T5**Prepositions**None**2**on>> our <<world**T6**Spelling**None**4**wold>> has <<his**T7**Agreement_errors**None**5**their>> own property right #DELETE#11#if wants so. And when <<somebody**T9**Spelling**None**8**somobody>> creates anything <<, he**T10**Punctuation**None**2**he>> has <<right**T11**Articles**None**9**the right>> to sell it to other people. From <<this**T12**Agreement_errors**None**5**these>> point of view, making illegal copies is a really bad thing, because after this musicians and film producers might not be able to create anything again <<, in case**T14**Punctuation**None**7**in case>> they #DELETE#3#are run out of money. Some people <<say**T15**Tense_choice**None**4**said>> that there would be much more art, films and music <<, if**T16**Punctuation**None**2**if>> everyone <<honestly**T17**Category_confusion**None**6**honest>> <<supports**T18**Agreement_errors**None**7**support>> creaters and <<buys**T19**Agreement_errors**None**3**buy>> legal <<products**T20**lex_item_choice**None**3**cop>>. That’s why people who <<download pieces of content**T21**Absence_explanation**None**8**download>> illegally should be punished.
On the other hand, the direct effect of punishing people to prevent <<usage of**T22**lex_item_choice**None**6**buying>> illegal copies would be opposite from <<a desired one**T23**lex_item_choice**None**32**“more good art, films and music”>>. It is clear that not every film and <<music composition**T24**Absence_explanation**None**5**music>> in our world is a great piece of art, because sometimes the only <<purpose of creating it**T25**Absence_explanation**None**7**purpose>> for producers and <<musicians**T26**Noun_number**None**8**musician>> is to make more money. So, when nobody knows <<if a film is good or bad**T27**Conditionals**None**21**is a film good or bad>> and they need to buy it or they would be punished <<it doesn't**T57**Absence_comp_sent**None**12**, it doesn't>> provide <<a good quality**T57**Spelling**None**12**good cuality>><<quality of a product**T33**Prepositions**None**17**cuality a product>>. The idea #DELETE#21#of this point of view is that people should only support creators if they like <<a product**T57**Spelling**None**6**produc>>. They can go to the cinema to watch the film they liked or buy <<a legal copy**T39**Articles**None**10**legal copy>> of music disk. In this way only good <<products**T40**Spelling**None**6**produc>> would get a lot of money and make our world better.
To sum up, this is <<a very complicated problem**T41**Articles**None**24**very complicated problem>>. <<The best solution**T42**Superlative_adj**None**15**Better solution>> would be <<if**T43**lex_item_choice**None**12**the right to>> people #DELETE#2#to <<decide**T44**Spelling**None**6**deside>> by themselves <<if**T45**lex_item_choice**None**2**do>> <<they**T46**Spelling**None**3**the>> <<want to provide**T48**Verb_Inf**None**12**want provide>> their <<product**T49**Spelling**None**6**produc>> with <<a property licence**T51**Articles**None**16**property licence>>. In this case people would get time to pay for <<a product**T57**Spelling**None**6**produc>> and after some time try it <<for free**T54**Prepositions**None**4**free>> <<on**T55**Prepositions**None**2**in>> the internet, because <<the internet**T56**Articles**None**8**internet>> <<does not belong**T57**Tense_form**None**13**is not belong>> to anyone.
