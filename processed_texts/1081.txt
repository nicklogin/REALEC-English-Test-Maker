Composers, singers, filmmakers and showproducers get each year less income than they could in the case if people didn’t illegally copy films, songs and musical compositions. There is an opinion that pirates who steal the data and upload it to the World Wide Web and people copying these files to their PCs should be fined. There is also an opinion that there is nothing bad in this situation. I would like to express my point of view on this issue.

From my opinion, the process of pirating films and music is illegal. Filmstudios and showbuisness industry spends a huge amount of money on their films and musical albums. The whole industry will become poor, the Hollywood will end its remaining and millions of people who work in this sphere will become unemployed.

Nevertheless, I think that CDs and DVD discs cost too much nowadays. In the situation of global economical crisis which continues nowadays, people can’t afford themselves to buy it. I believe the main key to the solution of this problem is the decrease of the prices on the official CDs and DVDs. Also there should be more stores where people could buy it in the world because sometimes people start downloading films from the Intertnet because of the lack of filmshops in their area.

To continue, I suppose goverments should add fines for copying and sharing digital files on the internet to stop the process of stealing films and music.

In the conclusion, I would like to stress that I believe pirates who make illegal copies of films and music should be stricktly punished and fined for their crime.
