We live in the <<modern**T3**lex_item_choice**None**12**contemporary>> world. There are a huge amount of developments in different spheres. The reason of it is globalization. That is <<why**T4**Punctuation**None**4**why,>> modern technologies are developing every moment. One of the significant <<steps**T5**Noun_number**None**4**step>> for development is the space exploration.
Many people d<<disagree**T7**Redundant**None**14**don't disagree>>with this statement, because they are sure that space exploration is not the u<<urgent**T6**Spelling**None**5**urget>>problem in soceity. First of all, we f<<face poverty**T8**Redundant_comp**None**15**face to poverty>>in different countries. U<<Unfortunately**T9**Spelling**None**12**Unfortuntaly>> governments don't d<<solve**T10**lex_item_choice**None**6**decide>>this problem . For example, the level of poverty is nearly 70 percent and the government don't take any actions. Secondly, another main problem is environment. The amount of rubbish increases every day. The level of deforestation and air and water pollution is awfully high. However, most governments spent money on d<<solving**T11**lex_item_choice**None**8**deciding>>this problem. There are new a<<aluminum**T12**Spelling**None**10**alluminium>>boxes for separating rubbish i<<on the streets**T13**Prepositions**None**14**in the streets>> For example, in N<<Norway**T14**Spelling**None**8**Norwegia>>appears the system of punishment. If you drop the bottle on the ground, s<<you will get a paper with a sum which you should pay soon**T15**Standard**None**57**soon you will get a paper with a sum which you should pay>> The environment issues in some countries are controlled. But turn to the main question of rational spending money.
However, nowadays governments try to control the situation in the countries. And now they want to explore the space. On the one side, it is a sensible act. Ex<<The space exploration**T17**Standard**None**21**Exploration the space>>an lead to the new technologies. Maybe soon there new facilities for living or even existing appear. A new br<<branch**T2**Spelling**None**5**brach>>f travelling will develop. Some people think that spending money on space exploration could be better decision. However, I can't agree with this statement, because it demands a huge sum of money, whereas spending money on medicine and poverty are mo<<cheaper**T18**Redundant**None**12**more cheaper>>Moreover, there is a risk that nothing helps to sp<<the space exploration**T19**Articles**None**17**space exploration>>For example, special equipment could break and governments will waste money. But if they sp<<spend**T20**Tense_choice**None**5**spent>>t for other ex<<existential**T21**Spelling**None**10**exsitional>>ssues it will help people.
To sum up, I would like to say that government should spend money on mai<<the main living issues**T22**Articles**None**18**main living issues>>
