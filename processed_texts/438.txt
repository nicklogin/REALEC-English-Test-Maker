The situation with crime in recent years has changed <<so as**T9**Linking_device**None**7**so that>> most of the illegal actions are being <<committed**T10**Derivation**None**8**commited>> by the youth. There are several major reasons that cause such tendency. This essay is aimed to reveal causes and give some solutions to overcome the problem.

First of all, many researches proved that there are high rates of crime nowadays due to the fact that younger people commit crimes. It is told that many of them were born and live in the areas where a burglary or even a mu<<murder**T2**Derivation**None**7**murdery>>re ev<<an everyday thing**T13**Noun_number**None**15**everyday things>>These teenagers originate from families where there are only one parent or parents work hard to bring up children so br<<bread givers**T11**Compound_word**None**11**breadgivers>>o not have that much time to spend with their own children. It could be suggested to parents to try and find some time to talk more to their children, educate them, di<<explain**T3**lex_item_choice**None**8**discribe>>hem what is allowed to do in the society. Children should be<<receive**T7**lex_item_choice**None**8**be given>>ore attention from parents. For example, supportive talks with children, asking about their li<<life**T4**Countable_uncountable**None**5**lifes>>everyday dinner together can help to change the situation for the better.

One thing that can be done to solve the problem is to pay more attention to this<<this issue**T5**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**12**this problem>>school. For instance, teachers can give lectures about the drawbacks and outcomes of comm<<committing**T15**Derivation**None**9**commiting>>rime where they will explain to the youth everything. Moreover, more literature with positive and appr<<inspiring**T6**lex_item_choice**None**12**apprecheated>>e examples can be read during the lessons.

To conclude, it can be said that r<<that, regardless of different reasons for crimes,**T19**Punctuation**None**47**that regardless of different reasons for crimes>>ould start doing something to prevent new cr<<new ones**T18**Ref_device**None**10**new crimes>>on<<Personally,**T8**Punctuation**None**10**Personally>>pose that combining both of these methods will give the best result and have a real influence on what the younger generation considers to be right.
