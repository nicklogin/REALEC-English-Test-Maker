It is known that the use of computers, mobile phones and other modern gadgets could be damaging for our health. It is a warrying trend since it results in severe problems with our eyes, weight and so on.

<<The increase of**T2**Prepositions**None**12**The increase>> these health problems we are witnessing today could be caused by a number of reasons. First of all, #DELETE#7#because sometimes we spend too much time sitting with our iphones or laptops<< which**T4**Punctuation**None**7**, which>> leads to <<pour**T5**Spelling**None**4**pout>> <<eyesight**T6**lex_item_choice**None**6**seeing>>. Secondly, modern <<people**T8**lex_item_choice**None**10**population>> <<buy**T7**Spelling**None**2**by>> more vehicles, move and walk less and finally put on weight, which consequently leads to some heart problems. Another important factor is air pollution<< caused**T9**Punctuation**None**8**, caused>> by <<the increasing number**T10**Articles**None**17**increasing number>> of vehicles, especially in big cities. Air pollution <<affects**T11**Agreement_errors**None**6**affect>> negatively  on our respiratory sistem. And what makes things worse is that nobody can do anything with this problem. <<If we live in an urban area,**T13**Punctuation**None**27**If we live in an urban area>> we <<cannot**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**5**can’t>> <<stop breathing**T15**Verb_Gerund**None**11**stop breath>> this air.

What is needed to improve the situation is <<definite actions**T16**Articles**None**18**a definite actions>>. Our daily life <<needs**T18**Tense_choice**None**6**needed>> to be improved. We should know more about time management and restrict <<the amount of time**T19**Absence_explanation**None**4**time>> <<we are**T20**Inappropriate_register**None**5**we’re>> spending with every type of modern <<gadgets**T22**Noun_number**None**6**gadget>>. Other measures could include eating healthy food, doing more <<physical**T23**Spelling**None**7**fisical>> activities and spending more time outside the <<house**T24**lex_item_choice**None**4**home>>, or <<, what is better,**T25**Punctuation**None**14**what is better>> outside the urban area. Another obvious solution is to encourage people to co-operate and share one vehicle with other people. In that way we can deal with <<the air pollution**T26**Articles**None**13**air pollution>> or minimize it. 

To summarize, I believe that the effects of modern <<technologies**T27**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> on people’s health is too serious to ignore. Some measures have to be taken soon, otherwise the environment and our health will be at great risk.
