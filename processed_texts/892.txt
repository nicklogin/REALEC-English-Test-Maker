The government of the countries <<considers**T1**Spelling**None**8**concider>> that they only need to produce the products which their population eats, and should aim to import less. And I want to <<discuss**T24**Transitive**None**13**discuss about>> <<this issue**T2**Ref_device**None**2**it>> in <<the essay**T25**Articles**None**10**that essay>>. I believe that <<it is**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> really important to use products which <<have been made**T52**Tense**None**4**make>> in your country. <<it is**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**4**It’s>> not just about food, but about some <<electronics**T28**Noun_number**None**10**electronic>>, cars and <<other goods**T29**Pronouns**None**9**smth else>>. For example, in the USSR <<there was**T30**Absence_comp_sent**Dependent_change**3**was>> <<an**T31**Articles**Dependent_change**3**the>> ideal situation. There <<was**T32**Agreement_errors**None**4**were>> <<no import**T33**Spelling**None**10**not import>>, but people were happy and they <<did not feel**T34**Tense**None**13**were not feel>> <<any deficiency**T35**Formational_affixes**None**7**deficit>>. People of our country made all products and food by <<themselves**T5**Spelling**None**9**themselvs>>. And that is why the USSR was the greatest country in the world with ideal <<economy**T36**Category_confusion**None**8**economic>>. But there were some technologies which <<Soviet workers**T39**Agreement_errors**None**23**the sovSovietet workers>> <<did not**T6**Tense**None**6**wasn’t>> learn. That is why we <<imported**T40**Tense**None**6**import>> some food from the other countries. But in Russia the situation is <<different**T7**Often_confused**None**4**else>>. We import almost every product. Our fields <<are**T8**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> empty. Our country <<has the biggest territory**T41**lex_item_choice**None**20**has the biggest size>>, but we <<do not**T9**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> use it. Because of that a lot of people<< who**T10**Non_defining**None**5**, who>> <<worked**T42**Tense**None**4**work>> in the USSR on the fields, <<do not have**T43**Inappropriate_register**None**7**haven’t>> <<a job**T44**Articles**None**3**job>> now. But <<the population**T11**Articles**None**10**population>> <<needs**T22**Agreement_errors**None**4**need>> food and the <<only**T12**lex_item_choice**None**6**lonely>> method to get food is <<to buy**T13**Lack_par_constr**None**3**buy>> it from other countries. Exactly that is why a lot of people <<have no**T14**Inappropriate_register**None**7**haven’t>> <<jobs**T45**Agreement_errors**None**3**job>> and <<Russian economy is at the bottom**T48**Absence_comp_sent**None**29**Russian economy at the bottom>>. But if the government <<does**T15**Agreement_errors**None**2**do>> something to change it, #DELETE#27#do something to less impor, our <<economy**T49**Category_confusion**None**8**economic>> will get the second life. <<To sum up,**T17**Punctuation**None**9**To sum up>> I want to say that <<it is**T18**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> very important to produce products <<for the population to eat**T50**Absence_explanation**None**30**that their own population eats>>. <<It**T19**Redundant_comp**None**4**It’s>> <<will save**T21**Tense_choice**None**4**save>> the <<economy**T20**Category_confusion**None**8**economic>> of <<the country**T51**Articles**None**7**country>> and create <<work placements**T53**Agreement_errors**None**19**the work placements>> for people.
