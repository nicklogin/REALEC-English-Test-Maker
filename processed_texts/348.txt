Nowadays <<such a problem**T2**Articles**None**12**such problem>> as disappearing of small businesses due to the increasing amount of large brands is becoming widespread. Local firms and family businesses <<cannot**T3**Spelling**None**7**can not>> compete with their professional <<competitors**T11**lex_item_choice**None**10**concurents>>. In this essay I would like to dwell upon the issue that this tendency can lead to equality and high <<level**T12**Spelling**None**5**lever>> of quality in every part of the world.

To start with, there are a lot of countries and towns with absolutely different levels of life. In developing countries people can count only on the fairness of local businesses. So, there are no st<<standards**T13**Spelling**None**9**standarts>>f their production, they ne#DELETE#4#ed simply be<<believe**T4**Spelling**None**6**belive>>hat this milk or meat was kept in a <<the right way**T15**Articles**None**11**a right way>>On the other hand, in top large businesses this is done fo<<according to the strict regulations**T16**Inappropriate_register**None**16**for you for sure>>Hu<<A huge number**T17**Articles**None**11**Huge number>>f managers examine all the te<<technologies**T5**Spelling**None**11**tecnologies>>hat are used while making a product, so, in each part of the world this product would be the same, would be tested in<<in advance**T6**Category_confusion**None**11**in advansed>>
Also, returning to the previous point, you can be sure that you would find the very product you need even in the other continent. When you come to the famous fast food rest<<restaurant**T7**Spelling**None**10**restoraunt>>u know in a<<in advance**T1**Category_confusion**None**11**in advanced>>t you can eat and you do not waste your time.

On the other hand, there are those who claim that killing small businesses we kill the culture. This opinion partly has a right to exist. People really do not try to find out something new, they automatically choose the product to which they are used to.

This thought may be valid, but for the economy the concurence is the major starting point. Well, the strongest survives. This provides us with the best products.

To sum up, in my opinion large businesses have better qualities than their smaller collegues. If the business is really strong, it will be popular. The more people work in this sphere for our wealth - the better.
