Nowadays#DELETE#1#, some political parties and governments are suggesting a “Guaranteed Basic Income” system in which every citizen of the country gets fixed monthly sum of money, which adds to their other income. There are two opposite points of view whether it is bad or good. I’ll try to observe both <<approaches**T5**lex_item_choice**None**8**advances>> to the problem and <<consider**T7**lex_item_choice**None**5**state>>#DELETE#1#, which of them is right or wrong in their ideas.
On the one hand, it is claimed to be a working and healthy system, which will improve everybody’s life. Firstly, it is a form of insurance for every citizen in case of emergency, when h<<he or she**T9**Absence_explanation**None**2**he>>will lose h<<the main income**T10**Pronouns**None**15**his main income>>due to some illness or something else. Secondly, it helps to rearrange economical goods so as to help someone in need by taking small part of goods from t<<the rich**T11**Adj_as_collective**None**13**the rich ones>>u<<through**T13**Often_confused**None**5**using>>taxes. Finally, such a system may help people to establish some business even without taking a loan from some bank.
On the other hand, there are not only pros but also cons in su<<such a system**T2**Articles**None**11**such system>>For instance, this way leads society to degradation as there are fewer re<<incentives**T12**lex_item_choice**None**7**reasons>>o work if you get money for nothing. Moreover, these “Guaranteed Income” is based on government where taxes are high, which means business sphere fe<<feels**T14**Redundant_comp**None**12**feels itself>>orse and wh<<the whole economic growth**T15**Articles**None**21**whole economic growth>>f the country is crippled.
To sum up, it is an ambiguous question whether this system is good or not, there are points for and against it, so that it is up to the people in certain countries to decide, w#DELETE#1#hich way they prefer more.
