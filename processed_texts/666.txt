Every day governments try to improve <<every**T1**lex_item_choice**None**3**any>> sphere of our life and to <<solve**T2**Often_confused**None**6**decide>> global problems in our world. The most dangerous issues in our society are air pollution and global warming. We know that air travel gives us a great danger and we will be in a huge risk in the future if we <<will**T4**Conditionals**None**2**do>> not <<solve**T3**lex_item_choice**None**6**decide>> this problem. People consider that governments should introduce laws that can <<reduce**T5**Voice**None**10**be reduced>> the myriad of air travel for business or leisure. <<Let us**T6**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**Let>> consider <<if this statement is right or not**T7**Interrogative**None**28**is it right statement or not>>.
Undoubtedly, we are face to face with a big problem because i<<of**T9**Spelling**None**2**if>>a lot of air travel, that c<<conributes into**T8**Prepositions**None**10**conributes>>global warming and air pollution, i<<and it is**T10**Absence_comp_sent**None**2**is>>unnecessary and we are just wasting it, goverments will h<<have to**T11**Absence_comp_colloc**None**4**have>>find solution of it. Almost a half of population supposes that it has to be not a good decision r<<to reduce**T12**Infinitive_constr**None**8**reducing>>the amount of air travel for business. I have the same opinion as people will w<<try**T13**lex_item_choice**None**4**want>>to make a lot of money on it and it will be a struggle for success.
Moreover, it can take a lot of time and money fo<<to introduce**T14**Infinitive_constr**None**15**for introducing>>aws because it is a long process even for go<<governments**T15**Spelling**None**10**goverments>>Ev<<Everyday**T16**Spelling**None**10**Every days>>hey make some laws for solution of some problems and only a part of it<<them**T17**Pronouns**None**2**it>>as been introduced. It is also a great risk for society as business leads to some dangerous situations between people. For instance, every year we ar<<try**T18**Tense_choice**None**10**are trying>>o have a good relationship with other countries. If air travel reduces for leisure or business, all countries will fight with each other and we will get a lot of enemies because people always de<<desire**T19**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**7**desires>>o make the best si<<conditions**T21**lex_item_choice**None**10**situations>>or their country.
However, governments should dec<<solve**T22**Often_confused**None**6**decide>>e issue because we are still in danger.The rik<<risk**T23**Spelling**None**3**rik>> global warming develops every day more and more.
To sum up, this statement has advantages and disadvantages.Gove<<Governments**T24**Spelling**None**10**Goverments>>uld compare them and decide how much we w<<will we lose**T25**Interrogative**None**12**we will lose>> get success for our society if it redu<<does harm**T26**lex_item_choice**None**7**reduces>> the sphere of business.
