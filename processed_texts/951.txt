In the modern world there is a dangerous trend: youth becomes more involved in crimes, robberies and frauds#DELETE#1#, than it used to be before.
There are several possible causes of this <<change**T2**lex_item_choice**None**11**development>>, but the main reason is obviously the spread of computer games. Nowadays a <<young person**T7**Inappropriate_register**None**8**teenager>> <<does**T8**Agreement_errors**None**2**do>> not face problems with access to computer shooters and digital mazes full of bloody monsters. These games teach <<young people**T3**Inappropriate_register**None**10**youngsters>> how to kill. Faced with murders and violence in computer games, <<an adolescent**T10**Articles**None**8**teenager>> considers anger as a normal way of acting. The difference between the reality and <<the imagined world**T21**Articles**None**14**imagined world>> is gone for young people. <<That is why there are cases when a child murders his family with an axe for prohibiting playing computer games**T22**Grammar**None**109**That is why cases, when a child with an axe murders his family for prohibiting playing computer games, exists>>.
Another reason of such trend can be the lack of opportunity for young people. <<Young people**T20**Inappropriate_register**None**10**Youngsters>>, struggling with self-realisation, and suffer from lack of motivation, see no solution of their situation, except committing a crime. On the labour market young experts are not demanded. It is hard for them to find <<a job**T19**Articles**None**3**job>>.
However, paying more attention to <<a child's**T18**Articles**None**7**child’s>> activity can easily solve the problem. If parents and teachers pay attention to <<a young person's**T10**Articles**None**10**teenager’s>> development, interests and education, the trend will probably decrease. What is more, computer games are the sign of boredom, that is why it is important to provide <<a young person**T15**Inappropriate_register**None**9**youngster>> with extra courses. <<A person**T13**Articles**None**6**Person>> who finished high education#DELETE#1#, <<is less likely**T12**Word_choice**None**15**has less chance>> to commit a crime. <<Statistics**T11**Spelling**None**9**Statistic>>, provided by developed countries, shows that crucial amount of crimes involve people without education.
To sum up, if parents want to prevent their child from crimes and <<prison**T9**Spelling**None**6**prizon>>, they need to pay attention to his or her education and provide different opportunities <<for**T10**Prepositions**None**2**as>> free-time activities.
