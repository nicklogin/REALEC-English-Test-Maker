The given charts <<present**T13**Tense_form**None**8**presents>> information about the <<transportation**T14**Noun_number**None**15**transportations>> of goods <<among countries**T15**Prepositions**None**17**between countries>> in East Europe in 2008. The <<percent**T16**lex_item_choice**None**7**procent>> of manufactured goods` <<transportation is nearly**T28**Absence_comp_sent**None**21**transportation nearly>> at the same <<level**T17**Spelling**None**5**lavel>> in both cases (25% goods <<transported**T29**Derivation**None**13**transportated>> by rail and 28 by road) Speaking about <<railway**T18**Compound_word**None**8**rail way>>, the same quantity of food products and <<chemicals**T19**Noun_number**None**8**chemical>> were <<transported**T20**Derivation**None**12**tranportated>> by rail. The <<percent**T21**lex_item_choice**None**7**procent>> is about 11. Machinery has a <<bigger**T10**Derivation**None**5**biger>> <<percent**T11**lex_item_choice**None**7**procent>>(12%). Metals are goods that has the biggest <<percent**T12**lex_item_choice**None**7**procent>> of transportation by rail.Also, the first chart gives no information about <<quantity**T22**Spelling**None**8**countity>> of non-matallic minerals <<transported**T23**Derivation**None**13**transportated>> by rail.
What is about r<<roads**T24**lex_item_choice**None**8**road way>> Food products has the biggest p<<percent**T4**lex_item_choice**None**7**procent>>here; it is about 30. C<<Chemicals**T3**Spelling**None**8**Chemials>>and n<<non-metallic**T5**Spelling**None**12**non-mettalic>>minerals have a<<medium percents**T6**Articles**None**17**a medium percents>>- 1<<16% and 13% respectively**T25**Absence_explanation**None**11**16% and 13%>> The r<<percent**T8**lex_item_choice**None**7**rpocent>>of metals is smaller (it i<<is**T30**lex_item_choice**None**8**involves>>11%). And machinary has the smallest one; its c<<quantity**T26**Spelling**None**8**countity>>a<<reaches**T31**lex_item_choice**None**8**achieves>>only 2%. So, we can see that s<<difference**T32**lex_item_choice**None**10**separation>>o<<among**T33**Prepositions**None**2**of>>t<<transported**T9**Spelling**None**10**transopted>>goods is not the same in the first and i<<in**T2**Spelling**None**2**ib>>the second cases.
