The bar chart illustrates the percentage of national population and of imprisoners in the Uk and in the USA in 2015. It is obvious, that the numbers of white and non-white people in the two countries are rather different.There ammount of non-white ethnicity in the USA is 3 times bigger than in the United Kingdom.First of all, there are only 12 percent of non-white population in the country and the number of imprisoned people contains only 26 percent of them.There is a significant difference in America, because the greatest percentage of people that are in prison are non-white. The white prison population is nearly a half of the non-white population. In conclusion, it should be said that there is a tedency that there live crucially less non-white people, that white ones in the UK and only a small amount of them are imprisoned compairing with another nationality. In the United States population of non-white ethnicities is much bigger and there are more non-white imprisoned people.
