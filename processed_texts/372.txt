It is no doubt that crimes are commited daily by many different people in our everyday life. Unfortunately, over the past years the number of young people choosing the criminal lifestyle has increased dramatically. There are various reasons for this and many methods to prevent the wrong deeds from happening. In this essay I will discuss some of them.

First of all, it is evident that nowadays a lot of pressure is put on the youth. With globalization happening, it is exceptionally hard to stay stable and feel safe and protected. Teenagers often experience anxiety and deal with depression, which leads to some of them commiting crimes. Secondly, there are many abusive and unfortunate families, where children are brought up witnessing more evil, than good. The history of abuse motivates people to continue spreading hate, as they do not really know how to treat others with love and care.
However, it is important to remember that those problems can be solved. For example, schools can take care of youngsters coming from abusive families with the help of child counselors and psychologists. Several hotlines could be created for teenagers to call and seek help. And finally, improving the healthcare system could potentially lead to more mental disorders diagnosed and treated.
All in all, as unfortunate as it is, there will always be youngsters engaged in criminal activities. However, if one is aware and educated enough, he is always able to save someone's life by spreading positive messages and helping those in need.
