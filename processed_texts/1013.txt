In the century of modern technology the problem of pirate copying in the internet is very important. A lot of talanted people loose there money, because it’s easy for everybody to find the new film or song in the internet instead of buying it.

I agree with the opinion that people making free pirate copies must be judged. Money that must be payed for masterpieces of talanted musicians, actors, producers are the salary for them. If there is no salary it’s better for a person to change his job just to get some money. In 90th a lot of young musicians stopped their repetitions and concerts because of terrible lack of money. Now nobody knows about there great talent. So, we have the risk of repeating. Secondly, the process of creating new movie or a song is not so cheap like it seems to be. Producers waste a lot of money in order to get more after the first night. And what to do if you can’t get your money back? Also the quality of shared copies is always not so good. Allfilms and music are firstly made the audience to enjoy it. Bad quality can turn all the pleasure you could got into nothing.

But there is also a lot of people who thinks in another way. For them shared internet copies is an ordinary thing which can make our life easier. They are sure that the easier access to culture can make it more popular between young people. Also they say that you never know if the song or a film is good, may be it’s not worth paying. For example, there can be a situation when you don’t like the movie, but you’ve already payed for a ticket to the cinema and it harder to leave it. Moreover a lot of people who can’t pay for a disc with music or a ticket to the cinema free internet copies become a great opportunity to get into culture and to be in trend.

Finally, I can say that in both extents there are pros and cons, but only government can choose to stop pirate copying and sharing or not to stop.
