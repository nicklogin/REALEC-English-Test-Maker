Everyday life in <<the developing modern world**T1**Articles**None**23**developing modern world>> <<is teeming**T2**Absence_comp_sent**None**7**teeming>> with gadgets and technologies. Some people believe that <<it  influences**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**influences>> people’s health.

The most significant problem is cancer <<, which**T4**Punctuation**None**5**which>> could be triggered by mobile phones and other devises that <<use**T5**Agreement_errors**None**4**uses>> <<radio waves**T6**Absence_explanation**None**5**waves>>. Although scientists <<have said**T8**Tense_choice**None**4**said>> that microwaves <<are**T9**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> safe for <<our health**T10**Absence_comp_colloc**None**6**health>> <<, there**T7**Punctuation**None**5**there>> <<is**T11**Agreement_errors**None**3**are>> still <<the lack of information**T12**Articles**None**19**lack of information>> <<on other devices**T13**Prepositions**None**16**in other devices>>, for example, <<microwave**T15**Spelling**None**10**micro wave>> <<diagnostic**T16**Spelling**None**9**diagnosty>>. <<Another**T17**Determiners**None**5**Other>> <<widespread**T19**Spelling**None**11**wide spread>> problem refers to mental <<diseases**T20**Spelling**None**6**diseas>>. <<The everyday surfing**T21**Articles**None**16**Everyday surfing>> on the Internet leads to anxiety and depression. <<The social networking**T22**Articles**None**17**Social networking>> <<is also**T23**Word_order**None**7**also is>> a cause of <<the attention deficit disorder**T56**Articles**None**29**syndrome of lack of attention>> and <<it is the main reason**T26**Absence_comp_sent**None**15**the main reason>> <<of**T27**Prepositions**None**5**while>> individuals #DELETE#5#often <<easily loosing**T28**Tense_choice**None**11**easily loos>> concentration. <<The amount of information**T30**Absence_explanation**None**11**Information>> nowadays is overwhelming, people spend too much attention on bright buttons and youtube videos and then <<they are not**T31**Tense_choice**None**5**don’t>> able to focus on important <<things**T32**lex_item_choice**None**4**work>>.

There are some solutions <<for**T33**Prepositions**None**2**to>> this problem. First of all, people <<need**T34**lex_item_choice**None**4**have>> to be informed about <<the damaging**T36**Articles**None**17**damaging features>> of some devices. For example, teenagers #DELETE#2#to <<, that have beed told about the influence of mobile phones on brain,**T38**Non_defining**None**63**that have been toldtold about mobile phones influences on brain>> tend to charge their iPhones away from their bed. <<The other**T41**Often_confused**None**7**Another>> way to reduce <<the number of health problems**T43**Absence_explanation**None**15**health problems>> is to <<found**T44**Spelling**None**4**fund>> projects that develop safer technologies, especially <<in medicine industry**T45**Prepositions**None**17**medicine industry>>. When it comes to mental health, governments all over the world should be concentrated on developing <<the sence**T46**Articles**None**5**sence>> of fullfillment and meaning of life in their citizens and try to attract them <<to live**T47**Prepositions**None**4**live>> in a real <<world**T48**lex_item_choice**None**4**life>>, not <<in**T49**Spelling**None**2**it>> the <<imaginary**T50**Spelling**None**11**imaginative>> mobile world. Socialization, since it leads to cohesion, is also significant, <<the connection**T56**Spelling**None**9**conection>> between <<people**T53**lex_item_choice**None**11**human being>> is a need, not just a want.

The problem now is far from being solved, but I believe that people <<will find**T54**Tense_form**None**10**would find>> the answer and <<will build**T55**Absence_comp_colloc**None**5**build>> happier and <<healthier**T56**Spelling**None**8**heathier>> future for next generations.
