<<From**T1**Prepositions**None**2**On>> this graphs we can see the rates of unemployment in different world regions in 2014 and 2015. <<From**T2**Prepositions**None**2**On>> the last graph we can see that <<the unemployment**T3**Articles**None**12**unemployment>> all over the world <<had not changed**T41**Tense_choice**None**16**have not changed>> since 2014. <<The graph shows us the same**T7**Standard**None**27**The same shows us the graph>> in North Africa and South Asia, the numbers stayed on the same level for 1 year. <<But in the Middle East the situation was much better,**T15**Punctuation**None**63**But in the Middle EastMiddle East the situation was much better>> the rate of <<unemployment**T16**Spelling**None**12**umemployment>> <<fell**T17**Tense_form**None**4**felt>> from <<11 to 9,6 percent**T18**Absence_explanation**None**9**11 to 9,6>> <<, which says us about good government policy**T19**Punctuation**None**42**which says us about good government policy>>. <<The 4th graph shows the same**T21**Standard**None**28**the same shows the 4th graph>>, <<the unemployment**T41**Spelling**None**11**unempoyment>> <<got**T26**Tense_choice**None**3**get>> down very fast from <<6,8 to 5,8 percent**T27**Absence_explanation**None**10**6,8 to 5,8>> (which <<was**T28**Tense_choice**None**2**is>> more than 10% for 1 year) in Latin America. <<In the European Union the situation was much worse**T32**Abs_comp_clause**None**46**In the European Union the situation much worse>>, the rate of unemployment <<had not fallen**T41**Tense_form**None**13**have not felt>>, moreover it <<had risen**T41**Tense_form**None**8**has rise>> <<by around o,4 points**T37**Prepositions**None**17**around 0,4 points>>. In the end, I would like to say that only <<the European Union**T38**Articles**None**14**European Union>> <<had**T40**Tense_choice**None**4**have>> huge problems with risen unemployment when <<the Middle East**T41**Articles**None**11**Middle East>> with Latin America are on the right way to overcome this problem.
