Nowadays more and more crimes are <<committed**T1**Spelling**None**8**commited>> by young people. I think it <<happens**T2**Spelling**None**8**happends>> because of two reasons <<, namely**T4**Punctuation**None**6**namely>> unemployment among youth, migration.
It is well known that unemployment among young people is higher than among other <<age groups**T3**Absence_explanation**None**4**ages>>. In some countries this difference is not very big, but in Spain, Greece <<, etc.**T5**Punctuation**None**4**etc.>> the number of young people who have no job is <<catastrophically**T6**Spelling**None**15**catastrophicaly>> high. So some of this people commit crimes to get money, some of them are rich enough, but they have nothing to do. Lack of activities forces <<these**T7**Agreement_errors**None**4**this>> <<people**T8**Inappropriate_register**None**4**guys>> to join radical groups (like nazi, antifasists etc.). To diminish <<the influence**T21**Articles**None**9**influence>> of this factor <<government**T9**Spelling**None**9**goverment>> needs to provide economical <<growth**T10**Spelling**None**5**grows>> in order to decrease unemployment.
The second reason is migration. The majority of immigrants come from less civilized countries without strong traditions of law-obidience, so <<migrants**T11**Agreement_errors**None**7**migrant>> <<commit**T12**Spelling**None**5**comit>> crimes much more <<frequently**T13**Spelling**None**10**freqiently>> than natives. But also we know that <<migrants**T14**Agreement_errors**None**7**migrant>> usually are young males (who want to find <<better jobs**T15**Coherence**None**10**better job>>).
So <<the boom**T20**Articles**None**4**boom>> in migration causes <<an increase**T18**Articles**None**8**increase>> in <<the number**T19**Articles**None**6**number>> of crimes <<committed**T16**Spelling**None**8**commited>> by young people. I think that government must prohibit immigration from uncivilized countries and accept only educated and law-obidient migrants.
The third reason is that youth is less moral and less <<religious**T17**Spelling**None**9**religions>> than their parents. Unfortunately this problem cannot be solved without abandoning distructive ideology of liberalism.
All in all, I think that criminalization of youth can be stopped if government really want it.
