<<According to researchers,**T23**Spelling**None**24**According to researchers>> <<use**T24**Category_confusion**None**5**using>> of illegal drugs is widespread now. There are two different points of view: sportsmen should not be allowed to do any sport <<for about 2 years**T25**Prepositions**None**13**about 2 years>> or athletes must not participate in various competitions for the <<rest of**T26**Word_choice**None**5**whole>> their lives. Both points of view are <<acceptable**T27**Spelling**None**9**aceptable>> and now we are going to discuss them.
First of all, there are too many sport scandals and the major part of them are <<connected**T28**Spelling**None**8**conected>> with illegal drugs. International organisations try to <<eliminate**T39**Word_choice**None**8**overcome>> them and the basic method is <<banning**T29**Derivation**None**9**banneding>> <<athletes**T30**Spelling**None**9**atheletes>> for 2 years. It is believed that after this period they will be <<unaddicted**T33**Word_choice**None**4**free>> and <<clean**T32**Word_choice**None**5**clear>> and <<there will not be**T31**Absence_comp_sent**None**8**will not>> any <<consequences**T34**Word_choice**None**10**aftermaths>>. <<Eventually,**T35**Punctuation**None**10**Eventually>> sportsmen can continue their careers. 
On the other hand, influention of drugs are <<impaired**T36**Word_choice**None**7**spoiled>> <<health, and**T22**Punctuation**None**10**health and>> competitions for sportsmen after <<drugs scandals**T5**Noun_number**None**13**drugs-scandle>> are unavalable. It should be said that if they use drugs once, they will do it again. According to statistics, people <<could not stop**T21**Modals**None**17**could not to stop>> and apply with drugs for the rest of ther lives.
<<In my opinion,**T20**Prepositions**None**14**For my opinion>>, illegal drugs-scandles should be solved by government and bounded any drugs in sports and competitions at all. <<Also,**T11**Punctuation**None**4**Also>> it is not <<fair**T5**Word_choice**None**8**esential>> to <<disqualify**T5**Derivation**None**14**discualificate>> <<athletes**T14**Spelling**None**8**athelets>> for the rest of <<their**T15**Spelling**None**4**teir>> lives, because they <<have participated**T16**Tense_choice**None**12**participates>> in competitions and <<have been doing**T18**Tense_choice**None**2**do>> sports from the <<childhood**T17**Spelling**None**9**shildhood>>. Sport is the <<meaning**T9**Word_choice**None**5**sense>> of their lives.
<<In conclusion**T1**Category_confusion**None**14**In to conclude>>, there is only one view and it is <<it is important that**T6**Punctuation**None**15**important, that>> government should prevent sportsmen from <<using drugs**T7**Gerund_phrase**None**5**drugs>>. Moreover, <<sport**T8**Noun_number**None**6**sports>> <<organisations**T3**Noun_number**None**12**organisation>> should not <<abandon**T4**Spelling**None**7**abouned>> atheletes <<for their whole life**T5**Determiners**None**14**for whole life>>.
