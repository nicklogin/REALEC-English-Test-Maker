Criminality is always a problem for every society. Nowadays young people commit more crimes than ever before and we should be concerned about it.
There are several possible causes of this development. Firstly, there is a huge influence of mass media and different video games. They substitute books that were read a lot by older people. Usually books teach us right things. However, young people prefer TV shows and video games. There is too much cruelty on a TV. Even news programs often show us killed people or tell us about different crimes. When young people see it every fay, they don't percieve it as something bad. They just get used to it. There is the same problem with video games. In some of them you have to kill people in order to complete a task. Moreover, in some of them other people are controlled by real players.
However, there are still several ways to solve the problem. Parents should dedicate more time to communicate with their kids, to explain what is good and what is bad. In other words, parent are responsible for forming their children's values. Unfortunately, some adults think that they only should provide kids with basic goods and give them a good education. As for teachers, they also have a huge influence on children, because they spend a lot of time together. Teachers can advice kids to read books that teach us traditional values.
Young people commit more and more crimes and it causes a lot of concerns. We should make some steps to solve this problem and make this world a peaceful place.
