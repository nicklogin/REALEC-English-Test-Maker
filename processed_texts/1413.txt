<<Nowadays**T1**Spelling**None**7**Nowdays>> <<people**T2**lex_item_choice**None**8**humanity>> live side by side with technology. Almost everyone has a phone, <<a microwave**T3**Articles**None**9**microwave>> or TV in <<his**T4**Inappropriate_register**None**3**his>> house. Our life <<has become**T5**Tense_choice**None**6**become>> more comfortable with it <<, but**T6**Punctuation**None**3**but>> <<there is**T7**lex_item_choice**None**6**it has>> another side of <<the medal**T8**Articles**None**5**medal>>. A lot of people suppose that <<technologies**T9**Noun_number**None**10**technology>> can <<cause**T10**Tense_choice**None**6**caused>> a lot of health problems. 

As we know, every technical invention that we use has a radiation. <<It is**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**4**It’s>> #DELETE#5#gives not <<so much**T13**Prepositions**None**7**to much>> from one phone but if you <<life**T14**Spelling**None**4**lige>> <<is full**T37**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**full>> of <<gadgets**T17**Spelling**None**7**getjets>> <<, the level of radiation is really high**T18**Punctuation**None**37**the level of radiation is really high>>. Radiation <<damages**T20**Spelling**None**7**dameges>> our organism <<, so**T21**Punctuation**None**2**so>> <<it causes**T22**Tense_choice**None**13**it is causing>> <<deadly issues**T24**Articles**None**15**a deadly issues>>. <<Moreover,**T26**Punctuation**None**8**Moreover>> people have to know how to use technologies or <<they**T27**Ref_device**None**2**it>> can damage them <<physically**T28**Spelling**None**9**phisicaly>>. 

Some people <<are able to reduce**T29**Absence_comp_sent**None**13**are to reduce>> this problem by refusing from technologies at all. I <<do not**T30**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don’t>> think that <<it is**T31**Inappropriate_register**None**4**it’s>> the right way. In our time you have to deal with computers and phones <<, so**T32**Punctuation**None**2**so>> I think that people should use technologies wisely. People must understand what they really need and how they can use it.  If <<people**T33**lex_item_choice**Dependent_change**3**men>> refuse from every technology <<they**T34**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**he>> will isolated from the world. <<They**T35**Ref_device**Dependent_change**2**He>> could not communicate with people who far away from <<them**T36**Ref_device**Dependent_change**3**him>> <<, for example**T37**Punctuation**None**11**for example>>. 

In conclusion I want to say that people should to know what they really need.
