The chart below provides some information about unemployment between 2014 and 2015 in several regions.
The first thing<< which should be mentioned**T1**Defining**None**27**, which should be mentioned>> is that in some world regions <<the unemployment rate**T2**Articles**None**17**unemployment rate>> <<had not changed**T3**Tense_choice**None**15**has not changed>> at all. For example, in South Asia we can see the same numbers: <<3,9 percent**T4**Absence_explanation**None**3**3,9>> in 2014 and <<3,9 percent**T5**Absence_explanation**None**3**3,9>> in 2015. What is more, North Africa <<had**T6**Tense_choice**None**3**has>> the <<highest**T7**lex_item_choice**None**7**biggest>> unemployment rate, which was the same in 2014 and 2015. The numbers are 12,5 and 12,5. As we see, <<worldwide**T9**Prepositions**None**13**in world wide>> we <<had**T11**Tense_choice**None**4**have>> the same situation.
The one more thing<< that can not be ignored**T12**Defining**None**25**, that can not be ignored>> is some important changes in <<the unemployment rate**T13**Articles**None**17**unemployment rate>> between 2014 and 2015. The first region<< which had these changes**T14**Defining**None**25**, which had these changes>> is <<the Middle East**T16**Articles**None**11**Middle East>>. <<The unemployment**T17**Articles**None**12**Unemployment>> decreased from <<11 to 9,6 percent**T18**Absence_explanation**None**9**11 to 9,6>>. The 11 <<percent**T19**lex_item_choice**None**6**number>> shows <<a situation**T20**Articles**None**9**situation>><< which was in 2014**T21**Defining**None**19**, which was in 2014>>, while 9,6 <<percent**T22**lex_item_choice**None**6**number>> provides <<an information**T23**Articles**None**11**information>> about 2015 year. We also have to tell a few words <<about**T24**Spelling**None**5**abaut>> Europe itself. The unemployment here increased from <<7,5 to 7,9 percent**T25**Absence_explanation**None**10**7,5 to 7,9>> (these two numbers <<showed**T26**Tense_choice**None**4**show>> the same thing <<as**T27**Conjunctions**None**4**that>> previous ones). The last thing<< which we must mention**T28**Defining**None**23**, which we must mention>> is the unemployment in Latin america. The rate decreased from <<6,8 to 5,8 percent**T30**Absence_explanation**None**10**6,8 to 5,8>>, which is <<a quite good example**T31**Articles**None**18**quite good example>> of <<governmental**T38**Suffix**None**10**government>> work.
In <<conclusion**T34**Spelling**None**10**conclution>>, we see that Africa and South Asia <<had**T35**Tense_choice**None**3**has>> <<a stalemate**T38**lex_item_choice**None**10**stagnation>> in unemployment, but we can hope that numbers <<have decreased**T37**Tense_choice**None**13**will decrease>> in <<recent years**T38**Articles**None**14**a recent years>>.
