Nowadays the crime level is <<pretty**T1**lex_part_choice**None**5**quiet>> high. There are many new ways of committing the crimes, for example, using credit cards <<on**T2**Spelling**None**2**ot>> the Internet. There are two solutions of this problem which are discussed now: long prison sentences and other ways of punishment. Both suggestions have their advantages and disadvantages.
People who support the idea of long prison s<<sentences**T3**Spelling**None**9**sentenses>>believe that it might prevent the crimes. If a person knows that t<<he or she**T4**Ref_device**None**4**they>>would be imprisoned for a long time for something illegal, t<<he or she**T5**Ref_device**None**4**they>>might not commit the crime at all frightened of the circumstances. Moreover, the work and regime there can, actually, make a person better because the idea of the prison is to teach the prisoner how to survive in real life without committing the crimes.
However, people who stay against long prison se<<sentences**T6**Spelling**None**9**sentenses>>xplain that there are lot of much more effective ways to have an influence on the criminal. First of all, big fines can be very useful in this situation because nobody would like to lose their money. In addition, work in the community services can also help a person to understand the value of usual way of earning money.
I think that the second position is more effective because, unfortunately, prisons do not usually work the way they should. The prisoners are usually destroyed there by the hard work and the attitude to them from the administration of the prison. When they become free again, they often return to the criminal style of life.
Summing up, prison usually has a bad influence on a person and there should be used other ways of redu<<reducing**T7**Spelling**None**8**redusing>>the crime level.
