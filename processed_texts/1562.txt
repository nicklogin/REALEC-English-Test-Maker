It is generally recognised nowadays that within the development of sport industry some athletes start using illegal drugs to improve their results. Does it mean that such sportsmen should be banned from competing for a limited or unlimited period of time?
On the one hand, some people tend to think that banning for a short or limited period (for example, 2 years) allows such athletes to realise their mistakes, thus giving them an opportunity to achieve their goals in the nearest future. Moreover, banning for the rest of their lives might have a negative impact on their career and reputation.
On the other hand, such method is not the panacea to the problem as nobody guarantees that a sportsman would not use illegal drugs again. Besides, it wouldn't help to take control of those who is trying to neglect the law or has already made attempts to do it.
In my view, athletes caught using drugs should be strictly punished and banned from competing professionally for the rest of their lives because in this case such a fair punishment which meets the requirement of moral circumstances, will not let other sportsmen follow in their footsteps.
