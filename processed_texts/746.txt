Nowadays the problem of crimes which are made by teenagers is common and has a bad tendency. The century of the technological's developement not always has a good impact. Because of that teenagers have more problems with their mental health which can be causes of all these crimes.
First of all, many of teenages prefer to play different computer games including very aggresive, for example, GTA or DOTA where they can kill people. Sometimes it can make them really dangerous and antisocial, some of them just don't grasp how human life is important. Moreover all these TV shows about politics which have not an age border, in such programms they can see how adult people can be agresssive and can not controll themselves. Sometimes even an old person can not deal with this wild influence on his brain.
I believe that parents need to allow children and teenagers play these games but in a right time and also parents should communicate with their children and offer them to play games like Scrubble or Activity all together like it was in my family. Both parents and teachers need to explain teenagers all these historical and political events gradullay without any overwhelming reactions.
To sum up, of course it is easily to understand that it is impossible to protect children from evrything in the world but parents need to be a part of their lifes not only a boss but also a friend, it is not really hard to doing sport together, for example. I believe that if people want to help children to beacome "a good" person we need to start with parents.
