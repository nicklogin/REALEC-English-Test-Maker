It is not a surprise that nowadays the illegal copying and sharing music or <<films**T1**Spelling**None**6**filmes>> <<flourishes**T2**Spelling**None**10**frowrishes>> and <<blossoms**T3**Often_confused**None**6**blooms>>. One category of society argues that such kind of pirates must be punished or even prisoned. Another group of people claimes that all individuals must get free access to all music clips, music compositions and films.
<<Without doubts,**T5**Punctuation**None**14**Without doubts>> <<the former position**T6**Articles**None**15**former position>> is <<well**T9**Category_confusion**None**4**good>> <<argued**T40**Category_confusion**None**10**argumented>> one. People <<who download files with music and a new film from the Internet without paying money**T13**Defining**None**84**who download files with music and a new film from the Internet without paying money,>> just do not respect individuals who <<have created**T14**Tense_choice**None**7**created>> all this stuff. We all have <<a person**T15**Articles**None**6**person>> <<whose**T16**Spelling**None**4**whos>> works we admire, <<it can be a producer or a musician or an actor**T17**Abs_comp_clause**None**43**can be a producer or a musician or an actor>>. We all should understand that this person put his soul and heart into his creations. Moreover, the work of <<a producer**T21**Articles**None**8**producer>> or <<a musician**T22**Articles**None**8**musician>> is also a labour, a hard labour, and this hard labour must be paid. The wage of <<a musician**T23**Articles**None**8**musician>> is the amount of money he <<gets**T24**Tense_choice**None**3**got>> from selling his music.
<<On the other hand,**T25**Punctuation**None**17**On the other hand>> many popstars as well as producers and musicians have a strong belief that people should have free access to <<their**T4**Category_confusion**None**4**they>> music and film. They <<say**T40**Tense_choice**None**4**told>> that <<if their music or films are really good,**T28**Punctuation**None**39**if their music or films are really good>> people will buy disc with it. Indeed, this point of view seems to be widespread today. Many people pay for access to online cinema platforms or music online clouds like <<iTunes**T30**Spelling**None**6**Itunes>>. As the advantage they get <<the best conditions**T31**Articles**None**15**best conditions>> of watching films and sound characteristics. <<Furthermore**T32**Spelling**None**9**Futhemore>>, people prefer to go to the cinema to watch <<a film**T33**Articles**None**4**film>> if they know that <<a film**T34**Articles**None**4**film>> <<has become**T35**Tense_choice**None**6**become>> the winner of the festival, it means that the <<film**T36**Spelling**None**4**firm>> is really worth and they want to spend <<their**T37**Category_confusion**None**4**they>> money on tickets or discs to watch it in perfect conditions in cinema.
<<My point of view is closer to the second one**T39**Abs_comp_clause**None**41**My point of view closer to the second one>>, despite the arguments of the first group of people. I strongly believe that it is not <<a relevant solution**T40**Articles**None**17**relevant solution>> to give people free access to all pieces of music and films but the government donâ€™t have to punish people strictly for downloading files with music and films.
