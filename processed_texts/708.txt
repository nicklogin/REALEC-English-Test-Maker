Nowadays the problems of air <<travel**T1**Noun_number**None**7**travels>> and <<environmental**T7**Category_confusion**None**11**envirinment>> <<pollution**T5**Noun_number**None**10**pollutions>>, caused by this type of transport, are discussed all over the world. Some poeple are <<convinced that the duty**T19**Linking_device**None**18**convinced the duty>> of the governments <<is to provide**T20**Absence_comp_sent**None**10**to provide>> modern <<laws to reduce**T29**Prepositions**None**17**laws for reducing>> of usage of planes for needs of passengers could solve these problems. However, there are some groups which <<disagree**T24**Voice**None**12**are disagree>> with this opinion. As for me, I completely agree with the <<suggested**T15**Spelling**None**9**siggested>> <<statement**T16**Spelling**None**8**statment>>, based on <<tightening up**T17**lex_item_choice**None**13**increasing of>> <<the new laws**T18**Articles**None**8**new laws>>. It could help to dicrease the <<number**T49**lex_item_choice**None**6**amount>> of consumers in <<the airline industry**T8**lex_part_choice**None**11**air tourism>>. <<Furthermore**T9**Spelling**None**10**Futhermore>>, this decision may lead to necessity of <<creating new ways**T11**Prepositions**None**20**creating of new ways>> of <<plane fuel**T31**Noun_attribute**None**14**fuel for plane>>, <<which**T10**Spelling**None**4**wich>> would not be <<so**T34**Adjectives**None**4**such>> <<environmentally hazardous**T35**Punctuation**None**9**insecure,>> as it was before.
Initially, it should be s<<said that creating**T12**Linking_device**None**13**said creating>>of the new code, w<<which**T14**Spelling**None**4**wich>>would not e<<except**T33**Spelling**None**5**exept>>the public usage of air t<<travel**T25**Noun_number**None**7**travels>>for b<<business**T26**Spelling**None**8**buisness>>and leisure needs, could make people think about journey by train i<<instead**T27**Spelling**None**7**insread>>of p<<the one by plane**T28**Absence_comp_sent**None**5**plane>> It is e<<evident that this type**T7**Punctuation**None**18**evident, this type>>of t<<transferring**T38**Spelling**None**11**transerring>>could be observed as much less h<<harmful to**T39**Prepositions**None**11**harmful for>>the nature. For example,t<<a train**T42**Articles**None**5**train>>could transport m<<a bigger**T43**lex_item_choice**None**4**more>>amount of p<<passengers**T40**Noun_number**None**9**passenger>>f<<per trip than**T45**Punctuation**None**14**per trip, than>>p<<a plane**T7**Articles**None**5**plain>> A<<Consequently**T46**lex_item_choice**None**11**Accordingly>> it would cause less damage.
The necessity of re<<reducing the amount of**T56**lex_item_choice**None**13**refusing from>>ir tr<<travel**T50**Noun_number**None**7**travels>>moreover, may open pl<<plenty**T47**Spelling**None**6**plemty>>f new possibilities for humanity in general. If the people ha<<were not able**T51**Verbs**Parallel_construction**17**had not abilities>>o<<to utilise engines**T53**Prepositions**None**21**to utilise of engines>>th<<they**T52**Spelling**None**5**theey>>ould have to invent something new. Scientists, for instance, would have mu<<a stronger incentive**T58**lex_item_choice**None**18**much more stimules>>or creating modern sa<<safe**T57**Category_confusion**None**6**safety>>ypes of fuel.
In conclusion, it might be observed that making new laws, based on evi<<common sense**T60**lex_item_choice**None**17**evident rationale>>ould help to avoid loa<<a lot of problems**T59**lex_item_choice**None**17**loads of problems>>day and in the nearest future. I am con<<convinced that the**T61**Linking_device**None**13**convinced the>>ggested decision could change life of the whole planet to <<for**T6**Prepositions**None**2**to>>e bes<<better**T7**Comparative_adj**None**4**best>>
