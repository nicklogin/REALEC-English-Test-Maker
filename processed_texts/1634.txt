Nowadays modern technologies are used in all <<spheres**T2**Spelling**None**6**speres>> of people's lives. That is <<why**T3**Capitalisation**None**3**Why>> it is important to know and remember about <<side effects**T23**Compound_word**None**12**side-effects>> of modern devices and tools because they have <<a bad impact**T24**Articles**None**10**bad impact>> on <<human's**T5**Category_confusion**None**8**humanity>> health.
I agree with <<the opinion**T4**Articles**None**7**opinion>> that people should be careful using modern technologies in their <<everyday**T6**Compound_word**None**9**every day>> life. Sometimes problems with health may be rather more serious <<than**T17**Spelling**None**4**that>> some advantages of computers<< and**T25**Linking_device**None**1**,>> telephones. For example, nowadays due to <<mobile phones**T18**Articles**None**17**the mobile phones>> with the mobile Internet we <<may get**T19**Modals**None**7**may got>> <<access**T26**Articles**None**9**an access>> to any <<kind**T20**Noun_number**None**5**kinds>> of information we need at any time and <<any place**T7**Word_choice**None**10**everywhere>>. This is <<undoubtedly**T8**Category_confusion**None**9**undoubtly>> a great advantage for people in <<the fast changing modern world**T27**Articles**None**26**fast changing modern world>>. However, such gadgets also <<provide**T9**Agreement_errors**None**8**provides>> teenagers with <<games**T10**Noun_number**None**4**game>>, social websites, which may be not only useless for them, but also harmful. <<From**T28**Linking_device**None**16**By the reason of>> constant <<use**T29**Category_confusion**None**5**using>> of modern devices many people have headaches, <<their eyesight gets worse,**T30**Word_choice**None**13**can see badly>> and <<they may develop**T31**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**may develop>> a lot of other deseases.
Unfortunately, people <<do not**T11**Inappropriate_register**None**5**don't>> <<foresee**T12**Spelling**None**6**forsee>> such health problems, but just try to <<overcome**T33**Word_choice**None**6**reduce>> <<them**T13**Ref_device**None**8**problems>>#DELETE#1#, <<when**T34**Conjunctions**None**5**which>> they have already <<got them**T43**Absence_comp_sent**None**3**had>>. For example, they go to hospital, take medicine, try to limit their children in using their devices.
At the same time, modern technologies may not have any disadvantages, if people use them rationally. For example, the development of technologies in ship building <<helps**T14**Agreement_errors**None**4**help>> people to send and <<receive**T15**lex_item_choice**None**3**get>> goods and products faster and more <<in a more ecology-friendly way**T16**Word_choice**None**23**ecologically - friendly>>.
In conclusion, the increasing number of health problems<< caused**T38**Attr_participial**None**8**, caused>> by <<overusing**T43**Prefix**None**12**the using of>> technologies <<has to be**T42**Modals**None**9**should be>> predicted by scientists. <<In addition,**T22**Punctuation**None**12**In addition,>> people should estimate their risks by themselves and <<stop using**T43**Word_choice**None**15**reduce usage of>> devices if they do not really need to use them.
