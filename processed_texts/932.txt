As it can be seen from the charts, metals that are transported by <<rail**T2**Articles**None**8**the rail>> account for 35%, and this type of <<goods**T3**Noun_number**None**4**good>> is the biggest part of goods transported by <<rail**T4**Articles**None**8**the rail>>.

As it is shown <<in**T19**Prepositions**None**2**on>> the charts, machinery <<makes up**T11**lex_item_choice**None**11**constitutes>> 12% where it is transported by the rail, whereas machinery that is transported by <<road**T12**Articles**None**8**the road>> <<makes up**T20**lex_item_choice**None**11**constitutes>> only 2% and #DELETE#2#it is the most <<insignificant**T18**Prefix**None**13**unsignificant>> good that is transported by the road.

Overall, the most significant good that is transported by <<rail**T13**Articles**None**8**the rail>> is metal (35%), whereas in <<the transportation**T42**Articles**None**14**transportation>> by <<road**T41**Articles**None**8**the road>> food products (30%) <<make up**T40**lex_item_choice**None**4**take>> the biggest <<proportion**T39**lex_item_choice**None**5**place>>. On the contrary, the smallest part of transportation by <<rail**T43**Articles**None**8**the rail>> goes to non-metallic minerals (6%) and in <<the transportation**T45**Articles**None**14**transportation>> by <<road**T44**Articles**None**8**the road>> the smallest part goes to machinery (2%).
