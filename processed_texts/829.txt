There are some remarkable tendencies and differences between the two countries.Let me a<<analyze**T6**Derivation**None**7**analize>>the charts.

First of all,it can be claimed that in both countries the vast majority of population is white, although in the USA the percentage of non<<the non-white**T5**Articles**None**9**non-white>>es not differ sharply from the percentage of white people.
