This essay will firstly discuss the main problems and offer <<positive solutions**T8**Articles**None**20**a positive solutions>> of <<these**T7**Ref_device**None**4**this>> issues. 

To start with, using of new technologies contributes to some kinds of diseases. <<These**T9**Ref_device**None**4**This>> <<health problems**T10**Standard**None**18**problems of health>> can be more or less dangerous.
