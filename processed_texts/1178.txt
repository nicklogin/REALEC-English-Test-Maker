There <<are**T1**Agreement_errors**None**2**is>> two graphs that <<describe**T2**Agreement_errors**None**9**describes>> what maximum and minimum <<points of temperature**T3**Prepositions**None**18**points temperature>> had reached in <<every month of the year**T4**Prepositions**None**24**every month for the year>>. The graphs illustrates dates in Russian city Yakutsk and brazil city Rio de Janeiro. 

Overall, the both lines of the first graph <<reack a peak**T5**Tense_choice**None**10**is riching>> <<a peak**T6**Spelling**None**4**pick>> #DELETE#8#stedialy and slowly <<fall**T8**Tense_choice**None**7**falling>> down <<in contrast to**T9**Prepositions**None**14**in contrast of>> the second graph that <<has**T10**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> not considerable <<changes**T11**Category_confusion**None**8**changing>> from one temperature for the period. 

Firstly, the maximum line of Russian city <<begins**T12**Agreement_errors**None**5**begin>> with around -40*C. And it is <<the smallest**T13**Superlative_adj**None**14**the most small>> point for that line as ending up point that is also around -40*C in December. To contemoratly. The maximum line of Brazil city <<begins**T14**Agreement_errors**None**5**begin>> with the maximum of that line is around 15*C. The maximum of Yautsk line is around 20*C.

<<The next type**T16**Articles**None**9**Next type>> of line <<has**T15**Agreement_errors**None**4**have>> date that <<decreases**T17**Agreement_errors**None**8**decrease>> almost <<twice**T18**Numerical**None**8**in twice>>. <<So,**T19**Punctuation**None**2**So>> the maximum <<and**T20**Linking_device**None**2**of>> minimum of temperature in Yakutsk is around 10*C. And the minimum is almost #DELETE#4#same like maximum line is around -40*C. The next graph <<illustrates**T22**Agreement_errors**None**10**illustrate>> the minimum line equal <<the maximum line**T23**Articles**None**12**maximum line>>. We can see that the maximum <<peak**T24**Spelling**None**4**pick>> is around 25*C and <<the minimum**T25**Articles**None**7**minimum>> is #DELETE#21#reach of July that is around 15*C.
