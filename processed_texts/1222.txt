These graphs <<show**T1**Agreement_errors**None**5**shows>> the difference in maximum and minimum temperatures in Russian town Yakutsk and Brazil city Rio de Janeiro from January to December. 

It is clear<< that**T2**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> the middle <<temperature is**T3**Absence_comp_sent**None**11**temperature>> higher in Brazil<< than**T4**Punctuation**None**6**, than>> in Russia. The <<temperature level**T5**Absence_explanation**None**11**temperature>> of Yakutsk <<starts**T6**Tense_choice**None**7**started>> in January, where <<the maximum**T7**Articles**None**7**maximum>> is -25*C and <<the minimum**T8**Articles**None**7**minimum>> -40*C, when in Rio de Janeiro at the same time <<the maximum temperature**T9**Articles**None**19**maximum temperature>> is 30*C and <<the minimum**T10**Articles**None**7**minimum>> is 23*C. Besides, you can see<< that**T11**Punctuation**None**6**, that>> <<at the top of**T13**Prepositions**None**10**at the top>> <<the graph**T12**Articles**None**5**graph>> both lines <<rocket**T14**Tense_choice**None**8**rocketed>> to July and <<show**T15**lex_item_choice**None**3**had>> a <<warm**T16**Adjectives**None**6**warmer>> weather there, while in Brazil the warmest weather was in January. In addition, <<the levels**T17**lex_item_choice**None**5**graph>> of <<Yakutsk's**T18**Possessive**None**7**Yakutsk>> maximum and minimum temperatures <<start**T19**Tense_choice**None**7**started>> going down after July, but in Rio de Janeiro both lines <<fluctuate**T20**Tense_choice**None**10**fluctuated>> during all the period. Moreover, both graphs <<start**T21**Tense_choice**None**9**had start>> not at the same temperatures <<as**T22**Prepositions**None**4**that>> in the end.

In conclusion, <<I would**T23**Inappropriate_register**None**3**I’d>> like to say that these graphs are very different, because the top <<graph**T24**Noun_number**None**6**graphs>> grew in July, when the second graph <<did not**T25**Inappropriate_register**None**6**didn’t>> have a really different temperatures during all time.
