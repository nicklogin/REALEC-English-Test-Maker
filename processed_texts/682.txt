Every person want to live in a society without crimes and feel safety while this problem still excists.There different ways to solve it. Some people believe that the situation can be improved if the time spent in a prison would be longer. In my opinion there are different ways which seem to be more effective such as the social politics and medical therapy.
To begin with, I believe that the government may establish some laws connected with the a<<alcohol**T1**Spelling**None**8**alchogol>> The wonderful example is Iceland which has such laws: in weekends the a<<alcohol**T2**Spelling**None**8**alchogol>>is not saled and the prise on it in pubs and restaurants is practically enormous for an average european. The consequences of such social politics is a very low persentage of crimes in this country. People work during the week and just have no opportunities to have drunk. The other pretty good tendency which is useful to cope from the Iceland is creating a big amount of stadiums and workouts all over the country. It also can reduce crimes because the energy would be spent on sport activities.
Moreover, I think that the special therapies can solve the problems connected with crimes. It would be effective if every person could visit a good psycologist for free or to go to the special recreation areas to calm. Also it is very important to have been annualy observed and to have a special cureness if it is requared. The people are to have care on their mind health too while in the modern world it is hardly ever seem to be urgent to ask for a help in these cases.
All things consideres, I suppose that there are more human-frendly ways to reduce the crime than to expand the sentence of a prisoner, because it is not a fear to become a prisoner decreases the amount of criminals but a clear and healthy mind.
