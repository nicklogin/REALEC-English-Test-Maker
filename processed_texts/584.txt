Nowadays government <<has decided**T1**Tense_choice**None**7**decides>> to provide scientists with money in order to let them do research in space. However, some people are completely aginst that because these money can solve various problems connected <<with**T2**Prepositions**None**2**to>> society like poverty or environmental issues. <<Altough,**T3**Punctuation**None**7**Altough>> many years #DELETE#3#ago before space explortions money <<were**T5**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**3**was>> spent on these problems, issues were not solved.
Space explorations can give us a lot of opportunities in the future. T<<It**T7**lex_item_choice**None**4**That>>is not a secret that our planet E<<, Earth,**T8**Punctuation**None**5**Earth>>is dying from toxic w<<waste**T9**Noun_number**None**6**wastes>> p<<pollution**T10**Noun_number**None**10**pollutions>>and so on. In many years it can die completely. That is why, if scientists find a new planet to live, human beeing as a kind will be able to survive after catastrophy.
On the other hand, people have problems right now. And doing something with poverty or environmental issues can save many people. However, space explorations can rescue not just many but all people from death if<<, if the new planet is found,**T11**Punctuation**None**26**if the new planet is found>>n case a comet or an asteroid destroys our planet. Furthermore, there is definetely not much money to save people from social problems. This problem is too bi<<serious**T12**lex_item_choice**None**3**big>>or the government and it has existed for too long to believe that it can be solved at all.
In conclusion, space exploration is a very important issue for people. It can save a lot of people one day. Certainly, government has to continue giv<<giving**T13**Gerund_phrase**None**4**give>>ney on it because social problems has always existed and spending money on it <<them**T14**Pronouns**None**2**it>>ll not help it.
