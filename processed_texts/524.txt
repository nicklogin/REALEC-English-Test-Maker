There has been much debate about whether <<a government**T1**Articles**None**14**the government>> should spend the budget on common problems in society rather than on research in space. The essay examines both sides of this exiting issue.

On the one hand, there is a common belief that expenditure on science is a waste of time and money and the govenmental budget sh<<should be allocated**T3**Verb_part**None**16**should allocated>>ore prudently for fo<<following**T2**Spelling**None**8**folloing>>essons. Firstly, lives of many si<<citizens**T4**Spelling**None**9**sitizents>>s<<are**T5**Agreement_errors**Dependent_change**2**is>>ikely to be threatened when the poverty rate in a country is quite high and this condition should be the dr<<driving force**T7**lex_part_choice**None**12**driven force>>ehind the governmental expenditure.

But on the other hand, many peole, including me, opine that without science, es<<, especially without space exploration,**T12**Punctuation**None**38**, especially without space exploration>> life will lose its meanings. Only by d<<because**T13**lex_item_choice**None**7**by dint>>scientific research the humanity has the world we live in, and <<no sense**T21**Redundant_comp**None**54**and the scence of existing in expolarion new areas, in>>ledge that can be dispenced in the right way to open new horizon.
If gover<<a government**T14**Articles**None**9**goverment>>t money only on public needs , the life would be less intresting , people would be less prominent.
