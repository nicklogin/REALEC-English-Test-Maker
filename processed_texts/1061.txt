Now I would like to talk about copies in the sphere of music and film production. Some people are sure that downloading the new song of Rihanna will not cause problems, while others are against copying and sharing at all. 

From my point of view, copies should be banned. Firstly, when you buy a disk with films or song, you show the respect to the author. Secondly, it motivates a singer of a film director to make more films or organize more concerts to show new pieces of art and culture.Thirdly, you give them a chance to improve their skills of renew musical instruments. It is very difficult to stay long term inspired without money.

Nevertheless, sometimes copies are quite useful because you do not need to save money for that DVD with “The beauty and the beast”. You can watch it at home at any time. Moreover, the system of buying original pieces of art will not work in Russia, where copying is almost a mainstream.

However, I strongly convinced that we should motivate artists of all spheres with money because no one motivation is better nowadays.

To sum up, I would like to stress out again that copying and sharing harms the person, whose songs you listen or whose films appreciate, - that’s why it is important to buy original discs. All work even mental and cultural should be paid.
