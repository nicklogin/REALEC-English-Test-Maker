Nowadays #DELETE#10#more often the problem of air pollution is discussed on the <<different**T2**Spelling**None**9**defferent>> levels of <<government**T11**Spelling**None**9**goverment>>. The main question is how goverment can influence #DELETE#2#on this procces to reduce the harm produced by people`s actions.<<Whether goverement should introduce laws to reduce unnecessary air flights for busines and leisure or not**T4**Absence_comp_sent**None**98**Whether goverement should introduce laws to reduce unnecessary air flights for busines and leisure>> is an issue worth discussing.
Some people think that using o#DELETE#2#f own flights has some advantages. To begin with, for modern business and technology process i<<it is**T6**Title_structure**None**2**it>>necessary for some people s<<to visit some different contries in one day**T7**Absence_comp_sent**None**34**some different contries in one day>> and air travel is j<<the only**T8**Word_choice**None**8**just one>>way in such cases. In addition, the question of safety is important for b<<businessmen**T9**Spelling**None**12**businees-men>>and people from g<<government**T10**Spelling**None**9**goverment>>because such people more often t<<than**T12**Spelling**None**3**tha>>others can be g<<targets**T13**Often_confused**None**5**goals>>for crimes. Moreover, t#DELETE#3#he using of such way t<<traveling**T32**Spelling**None**12**of traveling>>can make the f<<operation**T17**Often_confused**None**8**function>>of airports lighter because it can reduce time spending for p<<serving**T18**Word_choice**None**9**providing>>VIP clients.
In contrast, some people aim that the harm br<<brought**T19**Spelling**None**6**broght>>t<<by**T20**Spelling**None**2**bt>>sing private fl<<flights**T21**Spelling**None**7**floghts>>o<<costs more**T22**Absence_comp_sent**None**4**more>>h<<than**T23**Spelling**None**4**that>>hese advantages. Fr<<Firstly**T24**Spelling**None**7**Fristly>>te<<the**T25**Tense_choice**None**2**te>>igger number of flights in the sky can create more dangerous situation because in such case the navigation becomes more complicated.
