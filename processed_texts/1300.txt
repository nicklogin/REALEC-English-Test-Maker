It is often said that the increasing number of contemporary devices in our lives becomes <<the reason**T1**Articles**None**8**a reason>> of troubles with health. 

One of the most obvious problems is the decreasing level of eyesight. The main reason for that is <<a big amount**T2**Articles**None**10**big amount>> of time which people have to spend in front of monitors during <<the**T3**Spelling**None**4**they>> typical day working in <<an office**T4**Articles**None**6**office>>. Moreover, most of us are used to play video games, watch TV shows and news. These kinds of activities can lead to problems with eyes as well. While we are not able to refuse working in front of displays and become unemployed, one still can change the way he or she <<spends his**T5**Absence_explanation**None**6**spends>> after <<work**T6**Articles**None**8**the work>>. Listening to music, playing any instruments or at leas going to <<a theatre**T7**Articles**None**7**theatre>> would be more than enough to solve this issue. 

Another infamous thing that cannot be ignored is that modern people tend to have difficulties <<in**T8**Prepositions**None**2**to>> <<moving**T9**Tense_choice**None**4**move>> after 60-70 years of life. It is caused by TV and other devices, such as computers and e-books, which <<make us**T10**Transitive**None**4**make>> sit or lie almost for the whole day. Year by year it becomes <<the reason**T11**Articles**None**8**a reason>> of <<a bad posture**T12**Articles**None**11**bad posture>>, problems with legs, increasing weight and <<, finally,**T13**Punctuation**None**7**finally>> inability to walk without someoneâ€™s help. To not let this happen one should train for about 30 minutes a day using any method he or she likes: playing football or basketball, going to the gym or just running. 

All in all, these are not the only health problems which are faced by people nowadays. However, most of them can be avoided if we try to prevent the reasons that cause them even before the actual issues happen.
