The 21st century is the time of stress. And stress causes many <<debates**T24**lex_item_choice**None**9**arguments>> <<, and**T23**Punctuation**None**3**and>> <<things**T3**Articles**None**10**the things>> can even come to <<extremely**T25**Articles**None**14**the extreamely>> frtustrative situations. When people speak about crime the word that comes in their minds is "the youth". Saddly, but crime rate <<among**T19**Spelling**None**6**amoung>> young people is higher than ever.Their environment and the society tells them what to do and how to <<be**T27**suggestion**None**3**bee>> "cool" in someway.

The first argument is that most of them are rejected by society and to at<<attract**T28**suggestion**None**8**attrackt>>ttention - they commit absurd things to say "I'm different".

They think that they don't need the elder generation's advices and that they need to have their own experiences, but sometimes these very experiences drive to the road of drugs, guns and conflits not because they wanted to, but because of the lack of knowlegde and a massive ignorance and too much self-confidence.

They must be taught how to love, how to normally communicate with people. How to make friends and one of the things that must be deffinitely taught is how to take decisions. Because many of them almost always listen to their feelings while it would be better to face these kind of things with a sense of rationality. Yhey firstly may be angry but the shoul think a lot before doing or saying something.
When we speak about these kind of things,we have to remeber to listen to each other. Not to listen to answer, but listen to understand, because many prblems wouldn't evenexist, such as the generation problems and the same crimes, if people especiall<<, especially**T22**Punctuation**None**10**especially>>h would listen to each other, would try to understand and walk in each other shoes.
