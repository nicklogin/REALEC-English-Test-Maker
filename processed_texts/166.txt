Nowadays more and more crimes are being commited buy teenagers and young adults. There are a lot of causes of that, but the most important is the problem in relationships between teenagers and their parents.
Today parents are really busy, they spend a bulk of their time on the job. They don't talk enough to their children, so teenagers get a lot of experiences from their friends. Only really rich families can spend a lot of time with children and don't care about money. That's why teens are often playing on the streets, and there they can learn how to get money without job. Firstly they would steal a chocolate bar from the shop, but then they will be extremelly close to the criminal life. They will rob and murder with no care about others, and their parents will become just nothing for them. 
Obviosly, this problem has a solution. Parents and teachers should be interested in teenagers' life. People can call friends at home to understand, which kind of friends does their son or daughter have. But in my opinion, teachers play much more important role in the case. I understood that when my teacher really helped my classmate. He had a lot of criminal friends, missed a lot of classes, but his parents didn't really care. But one day our math teacher made a rule: after classes we stayed at school, and someone made a presentation about his life. Firstly this guy missed this lessons, but then he suddenly came and never missed again. He became our friend and finished spending time with criminal guys.
All-in-all, I suppose that many crimes are made buy young people because of no attention by parents. And in such cases only teachers can make them really good people.
