Many artists suffer from free internet downloads of their masterpieces, but those who download free music <<or**T1**Spelling**None**2**of>> free films <<are not always ready**T2**Standard**None**20**not always are ready>> to pay for <<the content**T3**lex_item_choice**None**5**those>>. So, opinions divide.
On one hand, those who make the music and films have to <<earn money**T4**Absence_explanation**None**4**earn>> for their work. The idea of <<a “poor artist”**T5**Articles**None**13**“poor artist”>> is already ancient today, as more and more people <<become**T6**Tense_choice**None**12**are becoming>> successful #DELETE#5#being musicians, actors, directors, painters and so on. <<These**T8**Often_confused**None**5**Those>> are <<the jobs**T9**Articles**None**4**jobs>> <<that**T10**Often_confused**None**5**which>> they <<choose**T11**Tense_choice**None**5**chose>> and <<that**T12**Often_confused**None**5**which>> are demanded in the society. We know some extremely rich artists, but how <<many**T13**Often_confused**None**4**much>> #DELETE#2#of artists in the whole world are trying to make the ends meet? Probably, <<one of the reasons why they are poor**T15**Absence_explanation**None**18**one of the reasons>> is <<a leak**T16**Noun_number**None**5**leaks>> of their products, so that they <<become**T17**Tense_choice**None**12**are becoming>> free. For instance, we always know how much <<it would have earned if everyone who had watch it had paid**T18**Conditionals**None**50**it would have earned if everyone who watch it paid>>.
On the other hand, Bono from U2 said that art should be free. Can we <<sell**T19**Spelling**None**4**cell>> and buy masterpieces, or art is more valuable than all the money in the world as it makes us more beautiful inside? Can we <<create**T21**lex_item_choice**None**4**make>> a world where art is <<a more money-dependent value**T22**Standard**None**28**a value more money-dependent>> by charging money for art? Also, <<a more rational argument**T23**Articles**None**22**more rational argument>> is that musicians earn more money <<from**T24**Prepositions**None**2**by>> <<the concerts**T25**Articles**None**8**concerts>> they give and tours #DELETE#8#they got<<.**T26**Punctuation**None**1**?>> But how can people <<discover**T28**lex_item_choice**None**4**know>> a new musician without <<listening to**T29**lex_item_choice**None**7**knowing>> his songs? People will not pay for the songs of those they do not know. So, there won’t be so many people on <<their concerts**T31**Absence_explanation**None**8**concerts>> #DELETE#16#as there are now. Talking about films, they make more money in the first months after the release. After that, only <<those who want to watch it in a high definition**T32**Defining**None**48**those, who want to watch it in a high definition>> would buy a DVD, Blue-ray or buy it on the Internet.
In conclusion, different sides of the conflict think differently. Artists want more money to earn, <<consumers**T35**lex_item_choice**None**6**people>> want less money to spent. It is clearly seen that free copies on the Internet make less harm than <<it is thought**T34**lex_item_choice**None**19**they are thought to>>. So, probably this situation should not <<be solved radically**T36**Standard**None**19**be radically solved>>.
