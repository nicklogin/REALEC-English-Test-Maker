These pie charts give information about the transportation of different types of goods. The first chart shows goods transported by rail. We can see that railroads mainly transport metals. Manufactured goods are the second <<most commonly transported**T21**Comparative_constr**None**11**most common>> goods, <<their share is**T16**Ref_device**None**8**they are>> ten per cent less than metals. <<Amounts**T15**Noun_number**None**6**Amount>> of transported chemicals and food products are equal and machinery is ahead of them only with <<one per cent**T5**Comparative_constr**None**17**one per cent more>>. All chemicals, machinery and food products <<account for as much as**T3**Comparative_constr**Parallel_construction**3**are>> the third part of all <<transported metals does**T3**Absence_comp_sent**Parallel_construction**18**transported metals>>. Non-metallic minerals are the <<least**T14**Spelling**None**4**leat>> transported goods, their amount is the half of transported chemicals.
The second chart shows goods transported by road.
