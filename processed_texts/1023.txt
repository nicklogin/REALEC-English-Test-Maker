Nowadays, illegal using of music content is a real problem, because of many difficulties, which sfufols us opposite producers as opposite usual people.

There are some opinions which I can agree with, but, of course, I can not state, that it is true. Firstly, the main result of producing and selling pirate copies is that musicians and producers lose money, and really huge summs. So, it means that it can be not enough money for next projects.

No one can deny that it looks like a robbery. The second point, which I can support, is the fact, that pirates can use musical and film copies for selling and make illegal money, which is criminal in many developed countries.

It is clearly seen, that everybody use illegal copies of music and films sometimes. And mostly such content is free, that is why so much people use and share it. You do not need to spend your money to watch a movie once. It is the main reason of such huge amount of pirate sources. Also, it is rather convenient to download a song, for instance, once and free and use it without any limits on any device.

So, two first facts shows that I agree with the fact of punishment, because producers and musician lose much money and can not invest it in their new projects. The next two facts of the charge and convenience shows that I am such a criminal, a pirate as other Internet users.

To sum up, I can state, that the punishment should be realized only for big criminals, for creating special pirate sites with stolen original content. But it should not be punished, when somebody downloaded an illegal content for his own using, only for home watching or listening. But the punishment should be for spreading and sharing illegal files.
