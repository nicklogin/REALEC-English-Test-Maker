The graph below represents the percentage of mature people in the USA who were online in the three particular social networks at the one moment of time.Overall, it is obviously shown that the number of Facebook users was the biggest one.

Speaking about those who used Facebook, the pick was reached by the young people(between 18 and 29) and accounted for 87 points. It is followed by the group of people between 30 and 49,it is well seen that though the result is lower, this generation still chooses this way of communication on the Internet. The generation of old people also prefered Facebook to diffirent social networks.

The popularity of Instagram is mostly provided by the usage of it by the young people and we can see a gap between them and those who are elder than 30. The tendecy for posting photos is becoming weaker and weaker when a person becomes elder and reaches the age of 50, after the moment the amount of adults who use it decreases.

The average number of points for Lindkeln users flactuates between 20 and 30 which proves that this is some kind of a compromise for all of the groups.
