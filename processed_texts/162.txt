Recent studies show that the quality of crimes committed by young people has significantly increased. In my opinion, this growth is coused by the influence of media and modern entertainments and also by recent economical problems. Although the limitation of their impact is crucial there is another good instrument for solving this problem, schools and parents' work.
Nowadays media is responsible for deminishing the meaning of violence. Many films and series contain scenes which depict such crimes and murders and rubberies as something essential. This makes teenagers underestimate the impact and consequances of such action in the real life. Moreover, computer gaming, which popularity skyrockets today, also contribute to the decreasing responsibility. Most of games have rather violent plots where murders and crimes are parts of normal life.
On the other hand, recent economical and social problems also influence on the rate of crimes. Young people who do not have life experience are especially vulnurable in front of them. Such trends like increasing social inequality, unemployment and limitation of human rights make them disappointed in the system and force to rise against it. This riot reflects in the growth of crime rates.
The solvation of the mentioned problems is crucial for stabilising the situation with criminality among young people. However, there is an easier way. School teachers and parents traditionaly have big influence on teenagers minds and values. They can solve the problem simply by explaining what is good and what is bad. Of course, showing the consequances of illegal activity is also important.
To sum up, although the increase of crimes commited by young people is a scary tend today, this problem could be tackled by solving the economical problems, controlling the media and parent partisipation the solvation can be changed.
