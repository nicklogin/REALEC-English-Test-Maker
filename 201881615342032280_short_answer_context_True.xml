Also, at the expense of these lawns we could widen our roads. (I'm not talking about trees, just lawns). Because Moscow is a capital, there is a great deal of government institutions of federal and regional subordination. As a consequence, lots of people go to the centre every morning. This is another cause of traffic congestion (not ordinary people but those with flashing lights on the roof of the car). The possible solution can be moving these institutions to the suburbs. However, before doing it we should pave the road to avoid traffic jams there. Furthermore, we can pave several chords in Moscow, because now the whole traffic is based on the principle of rings and radii. In conclusion I would like to add that there is no doubt that we can find many more solutions to the problem. But the main thing is just to start doing something, because here, in Moscow this problem has <b>unthinkable extent</b>.]]></text>

                <text><![CDATA[Spasibo Eugeny Essay 'Popular fiction is not literature' It's really hard to what can be called popular fiction and what cannot. To pursue the term, I think we should compare books with some other sphere of mass media. For example, with movies - there are popular movies, which were made in order to get big sales and which are broadly advertised, and arthouse movies, the main idea of which is tget through be popular..Like twilight "saga"'. It's as advertised as Chupa-Chups all around the globe. The word 'saga' was entered into the title to attract teenagers, since such things as Star Wars were called 'saga'. But while Star Wars somehow really manages to keep up to the word, bringing us a story of generations of Jedi, of how their art was brought through from Qui-Gonn to Obi-Wan, from him to Anakin Skywalker and then to his son, Luke Skywalker, Twilight actually does none of that. If we sum it up with the fact that the narrative is terrible, the plot has no point at all and is full of <b>it's</b> twists, deep and up to date problems, the narrative with incredible wordplay and use of the most sophisticated and forgotten words of English and desire to bring some beauty into this world, that there is no point arguing value.]]></text>

The World Health Organization states that 2.4 million people die each year from causes directly attributable to air pollution, and this number exacerbates every year. It's time to worry: according to the Carnegie Department of Global Ecology, the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air is increasing at an alarming rate. In the 90's, carbon emissions dioxide were increasing by about 1.3 percent per year. But since 2000, this figure has been 3.3 percent per year, so if we don't change anything, the situation may take a bad turn. All these frightening disasters, like the greenhouse effect, smog, ozone hole and acid rain, actually are the results of air pollution. For example, the greenhouse effect is caused by the toxic emissions of the oil combustion. The main enemy of clean air is methane. It is released by the decomposition of the sewage, with the natural gas <b>pneumonia related</b> deaths and air pollution from motor vehicles..

Venttsel and called the House of the Free Child (HOFC). The House of the Free Child was a where teachers, parents and children were united on an equal basis..There were no obligatory lessons and most of the studies were devoted to the development of the creative abilities: children were taught to express their opinion using drawing or modeling. Children were grouped according to their interests. Teaching was carried out not only by teachers but also by parents. So called lessons were held in friendly home atmosphere without any disciplinary restrictions. Ultimately, House of the Free Child was reduced in 1909 because of its inability to rear a society member of full value. However, the experience of the House of the Free Child is still of interest for the pedagogy today wishes at the same time.]]></text>

Also, at the expense of these lawns we could widen our roads. (I'm not talking about trees, just lawns). Because Moscow is a capital, there is a great deal of government institutions of federal and regional subordination. As a consequence, lots of people go to the centre every morning. This is another cause of traffic congestion (not ordinary people but those with flashing lights on the roof of the car). The possible solution can be moving these institutions to the suburbs. However, before doing it we should pave the road to avoid traffic jams there. Furthermore, we can pave several chords in Moscow, because now the whole traffic is based on the principle of rings and radii. In conclusion I would like to add that there is no doubt that we can find many more solutions to the problem. But the main thing is just to start doing something, because here, in Moscow this problem has risen.]]></text>

                <text><![CDATA[Spasibo Eugeny Essay 'Popular fiction is not literature' It's really hard to what can be called popular fiction and what cannot. To pursue the term, I think we should compare books with some other sphere of mass media. For example, with movies - there are popular movies, which were made in order to get big sales and which are broadly advertised, and arthouse movies, the main idea of which is tget through be popular..Like twilight "saga"'. It's as advertised as Chupa-Chups all around the globe. The word 'saga' was entered into the title to attract teenagers, since such things as Star Wars were called 'saga'. But while Star Wars somehow really manages to keep up to the word, bringing us a story of generations of Jedi, of how their art was brought through from Qui-Gonn to Obi-Wan, from him to Anakin Skywalker and then to his son, Luke Skywalker, Twilight actually does none of that. If we sum it up with the fact that the narrative is terrible, the plot has no point at all and is full of cliches twists, deep and up to date problems, the narrative with incredible wordplay and use of the most sophisticated and forgotten words of English and desire to bring some beauty into this world, that there is no point <b>it's</b> value.]]></text>

The World Health Organization states that 2.4 million people die each year from causes directly attributable to air pollution, and this number exacerbates every year. It's time to worry: according to the Carnegie Department of Global Ecology, the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air is increasing at an alarming rate. In the 90's, carbon emissions dioxide were increasing by about 1.3 percent per year. But since 2000, this figure has been 3.3 percent per year, so if we don't change anything, the situation may take a bad turn. All these frightening disasters, like the greenhouse effect, smog, ozone hole and acid rain, actually are the results of air pollution. For example, the greenhouse effect is caused by the toxic emissions of the oil combustion. The main enemy of clean air is methane. It is released by the decomposition of the sewage, with the natural gas <b>pneumonia related</b> deaths and air pollution from motor vehicles.. Worldwide, lifestyle, we can't help them to save themselves.]]></text>

Venttsel and called the House of the Free Child (HOFC). The House of the Free Child was a where teachers, parents and children were united on an equal basis..There were no obligatory lessons and most of the studies were devoted to the development of the creative abilities: children were taught to express their opinion using drawing or modeling. Children were grouped according to their interests. Teaching was carried out not only by teachers but also by parents. So called lessons were held in friendly home atmosphere without any disciplinary restrictions. Ultimately, House of the Free Child was reduced in 1909 because of its inability to rear a society member of full value. However, the experience of the House of the Free Child is still of interest for the pedagogy today wishes at the same time.]]></text>
